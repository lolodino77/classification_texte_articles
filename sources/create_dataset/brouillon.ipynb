It is not new improved, rather it is new and pretty bad. I don't know how to describe this since I've never seen or thought banana plugs could go wrong till i got these. 1 out of 3 terminals tips will be too tight to fit causing the terminal stents to become permanently pressed and therefore loose. Since the stent gets rippled towards the end it will therefore not go completely in. My equipment is fairly high-end and never had issues with any banana plugs until i tried these. i would stay away from any cables that utilize these new terminal tips.   \n",

       "1979754  I got these headphones exspecting great things. The thought of being able to just turn the computer on a internet-radio station and wander off while I paint or such in another room was tempting enough to provoke my purchase. A purchase I majorly regret. This product is definetly money down the drain. Oh it works all right, dont get me wrong. It works for 3-5 seconds at a time followed by 30seconds of silence. <br />The headphones constantly fuzz out, loosing connection with the tower. Even when sitting not even 2 feet away from the tower it continued to do it in the multiple rooms I tested it in. <br />The sound quality is sad. For the price it is you'd exspect better of it but it's hallow empty sound followed by a very light but annoying hiss at lower volumes quickly drive you to madn...   \n",

It is not new improved, rather it is new and pretty bad. I don't know how to describe this since I've never seen or thought banana plugs could go wrong till i got these. 1 out of 3 terminals tips will be too tight to fit causing the terminal stents to become permanently pressed and therefore loose. Since the stent gets rippled towards the end it will therefore not go completely in. My equipment is fairly high-end and never had issues with any banana plugs until i tried these. i would stay away from any cables that utilize these new terminal tips.   \n",
