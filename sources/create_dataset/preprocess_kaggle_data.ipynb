Fear and wonder meet in awe, which engenders in the soul humility in the face of being and docility before the wise, our teachers.      Quentin Tarantino illustrates this in his philosophical allegory of the soul, _Kill Bill_.

First, he argues that imperfect or functionless traits are<br>&gt; evidence against design. Second, he argues that since special creationism<br>&gt; can be made compatible with any observation, it is unscientific and<br>&gt; explanatorily vacuous. In later works, Darwin shifts to an argument that he<br>&gt; finds much more persuasive and which would undermine theistic evolutionism<br>&gt; as well. He argues that variation is random with respect to selection and<br>&gt; that this demonstrates that there is no design in the biological world. I<br>&gt; examine why Darwin found the argument from independence of variation and<br>&gt; selection more compelling than the argument from imperfection. I argue that<br>&gt; Darwin utilized general principles of causal inference, akin to those used<br>&gt; in modern causal modeling, to rule out any unified cause behind the<br>&gt; evolutionary process.</td>\n",

       "      <td>&gt; This book critically assesses arguments for the existence of the God of<br>&gt; classical theism, develops an innovative account of objects’ persistence,<br>&gt; and defends new arguments against classical theism. The authors engage the<br>&gt; following classical theistic proofs: Aquinas’s First Way, Aquinas’s De Ente<br>&gt; argument, and Feser’s Aristotelian, Neo-Platonic, Augustinian, Thomistic,<br>&gt; and Rationalist proofs. The authors also provide the first systematic<br>&gt; treatment of the ‘existential inertia thesis’. By connecting the thesis to<br>&gt; relativity theory and recent developments in the philosophy of physics, and<br>&gt; by developing a variety of novel existential-inertia-friendly explanations<br>&gt; of persistence, they mount a formidable new case against classical theistic<br>&gt; proofs. Finally, they defend new arguments against classical theism based on<br>&gt; abstract objects and changing divine knowledge. The text appeals to<br>&gt; students, researchers, and others interested in classical theistic proofs,<br>&gt; the existence and nature of God, and the ultimate explanations of<br>&gt; persistence, change, and contingency.</td>\n",

I argue, however, that to the extent that a divine<br>&gt; command theory succeeds, an ideal observer theory can do equally well. Once<br>&gt; the divine command theory is rendered immune to Euthyphro-related<br>&gt; objections, we will have all the machinery needed to show that an ideal<br>&gt; observer theory can provide the same metaethical advantages, without<br>&gt; supposing the existence of a divine commander.

Without Platonic objects, atheism degenerates into an<br>&gt; illogical nihilism. Atheistic Platonism instead provides reality with<br>&gt; foundations that are eternal, necessary, rational, beautiful, and utterly<br>&gt; mindless. It argues for a plenitude of mathematical objects, and an infinite<br>&gt; plurality of possible universes. It provides mindless rational grounds for<br>&gt; objective values, and for objective moral laws for the persons who evolve in<br>&gt; universes. It defines a meaningful way of life, which facilitates self-<br>&gt; improvement. Atheistic Platonists argue for computational theories of life<br>&gt; after death. Atheistic Platonism includes a rich system of spiritual<br>&gt; symbols. It values transformational practices and ecstatic experiences.<br>&gt; Where atheisms based on materialism fail, atheisms based on Platonism<br>&gt; succeed.</td>\n",

When you turn up the volume close to its maximum, the sound is still clean, not distorted and scratchy like most  boomboxes.  Most boomboxes have some sort of feature which enhances the  bass and low frequency mid-range notes.  This boombox, instead of a  one-button &quot;all or nothing&quot; bass enhancement, has a variable bass  enhancement feature; it has six levels to choose from, and each level is  distinctly more powerful than the previous level.  I am 100% totally  satisfied with this product.   \n",

       "3091019  Diamond's RIO is the current, silicon-state nightmare for monopolistic entertainment industries. When the first audio recording-devices entered the consumer market decades ago, the idea of a controlled  &quot;charge-per-copy&quot; business model in the music industry was  doomed. Although traditional copyrights could never be totally enforced,  the record and music-producing industry neglected these threads existing in  the shades of multi-billion profits.<br />Mp3 and the Internet raided the  existing markets with their &quot;natural&quot; power like a cruise-missile  against a frying-pan.  Like other good examples for  &quot;Killer-Apps&quot;, the RIO is designed to Web-Specs (mp3).

It is so great that Diamond Multimedia prevailed in their fight against the forces of pure evil in the music industry and allowed us, the public, to have the RIO! This little baby holds your MP3's and plays  them with outrageous quality and no moving parts! You simply cannot make  the music &quot;skip&quot;. Take it jogging, bob sledding, whatever! The  Rio is cute and compact, battery lasts forever, runs great and is really  simple to use. Works well with the PC linkup, etc. A hot item!   \n",

When you turn up the volume close to its maximum, the sound is still clean, not distorted and scratchy like most  boomboxes.  Most boomboxes have some sort of feature which enhances the  bass and low frequency mid-range notes.  This boombox, instead of a  one-button &quot;all or nothing&quot; bass enhancement, has a variable bass  enhancement feature; it has six levels to choose from, and each level is  distinctly more powerful than the previous level.  I am 100% totally  satisfied with this product.   \n",
