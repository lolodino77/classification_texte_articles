       "      <td>&gt; The idea of eternal damnation, which had taken ever clearer shape in the &gt; Judaism of the Century or two before Christ, has a firm place in the &gt; teaching of Jesus, as well as in the apostolic writings. Dogma takes its &gt; stand on solid ground when it speaks of the existence of Hell and of the &gt; eternity of its punishments. &gt; &gt; This teaching, so contrary to our ideas about God and about man, was &gt; naturally only accepted with great difficulty. According to fragments &gt; preserved in Justinian and the Pseudo-Leontius, it was Origen who, in his &gt; ambitious attempt to systematize Christianity, the Peri Archon, first &gt; proposed the idea that given the logic of God’s relationship with history, &gt; there must be a universal reconciliation at the End.

       "      <td>The psalmist says, \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom\" (Ps. 111.10, Pr. 9.10), while Aristotle says that philosophy begins in wonder (Met. 1.1). Fear and wonder meet in awe, which engenders in the soul humility in the face of being and docility before the wise, our teachers.      Quentin Tarantino illustrates this in his philosophical allegory of the soul, _Kill Bill_. The different possible characters of the soul in its disposition towards knowledge are pictured in the Bride and her alter ego, Elle. Although their enmity is clearly shown from the beginning, its roots in their contrasting characters isn't revealed until Volume 2, in the Pai Mei sequence. The Bride approaches the kung fu master Pai Mei with a spirit of docility and a thirst for knowledge. She submits to hi...</td>\n",

One of the benefits of no longer being in institutional academia (condolences to my esteemed co-blogger) is that I can study whatever I want without regard to my curriculum vitae or departmental or disciplinary expectations.

This wonderful experience has confirmed my long-held sense that Homer is the king of all poets: as someone or other said, Homer is the proof that there is no progress in the arts.

       "9778  The psalmist says, \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom\" (Ps. 111.10, Pr. 9.10), while Aristotle says that philosophy begins in wonder (Met. 1.1). Fear and wonder meet in awe, which engenders in the soul humility in the face of being and docility before the wise, our teachers.      Quentin Tarantino illustrates this in his philosophical allegory of the soul, _Kill Bill_. The different possible characters of the soul in its disposition towards knowledge are pictured in the Bride and her alter ego, Elle. Although their enmity is clearly shown from the beginning, its roots in their contrasting characters isn't revealed until Volume 2, in the Pai Mei sequence. The Bride approaches the kung fu master Pai Mei with a spirit of docility and a thirst for knowledge. She submits to hi...   \n",
       "3179  This post is not about Scotus.      One of the benefits of no longer being in institutional academia (condolences to my esteemed co-blogger) is that I can study whatever I want without regard to my curriculum vitae or departmental or disciplinary expectations. What I've been studying most lately is Greek. At long last I'm getting close to finishing my first complete read-through of both the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ in Greek. This wonderful experience has confirmed my long-held sense that Homer is the king of all poets: as someone or other said, Homer is the proof that there is no progress in the arts. There may be a very few who could claim to be _as great_ , but there are none greater, none more beautiful, none more insightful, none more intricate. As I reach the end I'm struck more ...   \n",

First, he argues that imperfect or functionless traits are<br>&gt; evidence against design. Second, he argues that since special creationism<br>&gt; can be made compatible with any observation, it is unscientific and<br>&gt; explanatorily vacuous. In later works, Darwin shifts to an argument that he<br>&gt; finds much more persuasive and which would undermine theistic evolutionism<br>&gt; as well. He argues that variation is random with respect to selection and<br>&gt; that this demonstrates that there is no design in the biological world. I<br>&gt; examine why Darwin found the argument from independence of variation and<br>&gt; selection more compelling than the argument from imperfection. I argue that<br>&gt; Darwin utilized general principles of causal inference, akin to those used<br>&gt; in modern causal modeling, to rule out any unified cause behind the<br>&gt; evolutionary process.</td>\n",

       "      <td>&gt; This book critically assesses arguments for the existence of the God of<br>&gt; classical theism, develops an innovative account of objects’ persistence,<br>&gt; and defends new arguments against classical theism. The authors engage the<br>&gt; following classical theistic proofs: Aquinas’s First Way, Aquinas’s De Ente<br>&gt; argument, and Feser’s Aristotelian, Neo-Platonic, Augustinian, Thomistic,<br>&gt; and Rationalist proofs. The authors also provide the first systematic<br>&gt; treatment of the ‘existential inertia thesis’. By connecting the thesis to<br>&gt; relativity theory and recent developments in the philosophy of physics, and<br>&gt; by developing a variety of novel existential-inertia-friendly explanations<br>&gt; of persistence, they mount a formidable new case against classical theistic<br>&gt; proofs. Finally, they defend new arguments against classical theism based on<br>&gt; abstract objects and changing divine knowledge. The text appeals to<br>&gt; students, researchers, and others interested in classical theistic proofs,<br>&gt; the existence and nature of God, and the ultimate explanations of<br>&gt; persistence, change, and contingency.</td>\n",

I survey the attempt sympathetically with a view to explaining how<br>&gt; the divine command theory can deal with traditional objections while<br>&gt; delivering on metaethical desiderata, such as providing an account of<br>&gt; ethical objectivity. I argue, however, that to the extent that a divine<br>&gt; command theory succeeds, an ideal observer theory can do equally well. Once<br>&gt; the divine command theory is rendered immune to Euthyphro-related<br>&gt; objections, we will have all the machinery needed to show that an ideal<br>&gt; observer theory can provide the same metaethical advantages, without<br>&gt; supposing the existence of a divine commander.

       "      <td>&gt; Atheistic Platonism is an alternative to both theism and nihilistic atheism.<br>&gt; It shows how any jobs allegedly done by God are better done by impersonal<br>&gt; Platonic objects. Without Platonic objects, atheism degenerates into an<br>&gt; illogical nihilism. Atheistic Platonism instead provides reality with<br>&gt; foundations that are eternal, necessary, rational, beautiful, and utterly<br>&gt; mindless. It argues for a plenitude of mathematical objects, and an infinite<br>&gt; plurality of possible universes. It provides mindless rational grounds for<br>&gt; objective values, and for objective moral laws for the persons who evolve in<br>&gt; universes. It defines a meaningful way of life, which facilitates self-<br>&gt; improvement. Atheistic Platonists argue for computational theories of life<br>&gt; after death. Atheistic Platonism includes a rich system of spiritual<br>&gt; symbols. It values transformational practices and ecstatic experiences.<br>&gt; Where atheisms based on materialism fail, atheisms based on Platonism<br>&gt; succeed.</td>\n",

When you turn up the volume close to its maximum, the sound is still clean, not distorted and scratchy like most  boomboxes.  Most boomboxes have some sort of feature which enhances the  bass and low frequency mid-range notes.  This boombox, instead of a  one-button &quot;all or nothing&quot; bass enhancement, has a variable bass  enhancement feature; it has six levels to choose from, and each level is  distinctly more powerful than the previous level.  I am 100% totally  satisfied with this product.   \n",

       "3091019  Diamond's RIO is the current, silicon-state nightmare for monopolistic entertainment industries. When the first audio recording-devices entered the consumer market decades ago, the idea of a controlled  &quot;charge-per-copy&quot; business model in the music industry was  doomed. Although traditional copyrights could never be totally enforced,  the record and music-producing industry neglected these threads existing in  the shades of multi-billion profits.<br />Mp3 and the Internet raided the  existing markets with their &quot;natural&quot; power like a cruise-missile  against a frying-pan.  Like other good examples for  &quot;Killer-Apps&quot;, the RIO is designed to Web-Specs (mp3).

This little baby holds your MP3's and plays  them with outrageous quality and no moving parts! You simply cannot make  the music &quot;skip&quot;. Take it jogging, bob sledding, whatever!

When you turn up the volume close to its maximum, the sound is still clean, not distorted and scratchy like most  boomboxes.  Most boomboxes have some sort of feature which enhances the  bass and low frequency mid-range notes.  This boombox, instead of a  one-button &quot;all or nothing&quot; bass enhancement, has a variable bass  enhancement feature; it has six levels to choose from, and each level is  distinctly more powerful than the previous level.  I am 100% totally  satisfied with this product.   \n",
