Although traditional copyrights could never be totally enforced,  the record and music-producing industry neglected these threads existing in  the shades of multi-billion profits.&lt;br /&gt;Mp3 and the Internet raided the  existing markets with their &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; power like a cruise-missile  against a frying-pan.

       "3091019  Diamond's RIO is the current, silicon-state nightmare for monopolistic entertainment industries. When the first audio recording-devices entered the consumer market decades ago, the idea of a controlled  &quot;charge-per-copy&quot; business model in the music industry was  doomed. Although traditional copyrights could never be totally enforced,  the record and music-producing industry neglected these threads existing in  the shades of multi-billion profits.<br />Mp3 and the Internet raided the  existing markets with their &quot;natural&quot; power like a cruise-missile  against a frying-pan.  Like other good examples for  &quot;Killer-Apps&quot;, the RIO is designed to Web-Specs (mp3). This makes  its use and performance comparable with other CD-quality playing devices  while putting th...   \n",

It is so great that Diamond Multimedia prevailed in their fight against the forces of pure evil in the music industry and allowed us, the public, to have the RIO! This little baby holds your MP3's and plays  them with outrageous quality and no moving parts! You simply cannot make  the music &quot;skip&quot;. Take it jogging, bob sledding, whatever! The  Rio is cute and compact, battery lasts forever, runs great and is really  simple to use. Works well with the PC linkup, etc. A hot item!   \n",

When you turn up the volume close to its maximum, the sound is still clean, not distorted and scratchy like most  boomboxes.  Most boomboxes have some sort of feature which enhances the  bass and low frequency mid-range notes.  This boombox, instead of a  one-button &quot;all or nothing&quot; bass enhancement, has a variable bass  enhancement feature; it has six levels to choose from, and each level is  distinctly more powerful than the previous level.  I am 100% totally  satisfied with this product.   \n",
