296,pruss,feser,"Wesley:      ""by that same logic one could maybe deny one truly possesses being or goodness or value""      There is precedent for saying something like that. ""No one is good but God alone"" (Mark 10:8).      There has got to be a sense, and a very important one, in which what Jesus says is true. But there is also a sense in which we are good--but only good- by-participation."

174,pruss,feser,A comment by a referee of a recent paper of mine that one of my results in decision theory didn’t actually depend on numerical probabilities and hence could extend to social choice principles made me realize that this may be true for some other things I’ve done.
58,pruss,feser,"Premise (1) is controversial. The ancient Greeks would have denied it. But I think the reason they denied it is that they didn’t have the examples that the Christian tradition does, highly attractive examples examples of accomplished lives of great humility."

461,pruss,feser,"Perhaps not negatively, but certainly 'without love'. It seems to me that God did not have to create you and thus God did not have to love you. If God were forced to love you or loved you randomly, I wouldn't consider God to be a moral being. I also wouldn't consider love to be a moral good if it were forced. Therefore, it seems possible that evil actions are merely privations of good actions, and thus one cannot choose to do ""nothing"" because ""nothing"" is a lack of good, which seems to be some sort of evil. Perhaps one could make a distinction between evils, but it seems that this might be a better distinction that the one I previously drew."
44,feser,pruss,"The considerations raised by Cartwright greatly reinforce these judgments. In particular, they reinforce the underdetermination of theory by evidence insofar as it isn’t just alternative theories that are compatible with the same empirical evidence. There are also the alternative possible models, narratives, diagrams, etc. which mediate between theory and evidence. And as with theories, so too with models, narratives, diagrams, etc., philosophical considerations no less than empirical ones can influence our judgments about what is within the range of respectable options, what is plausible all things considered, and so forth."

128,feser,pruss,"That is by no means to deny that such arguments might pose serious challenges to certain purported materialist or naturalistic explanations of this or that phenomenon. But to undermine some particular naturalistic explanation, however important, is not the same thing as establishing theism.  The relationship between the two sets of issues is more complicated than that."
1248,pruss,feser,"Maybe, but can you say: What it is for you to be good is for you to be a good man?      Maybe the issue is that there is an ambiguity. A man (in the relevant sense) is an adult male human. But ""good adult male human"" is a bit ambiguous: is one good at the adulting, the maleness or the humanness, or at all three?      I would say that what makes you be good is that you are good at being human, and given that you are a man, this may have certain implications that it wouldn't have if you weren't a man. (E.g., that you are a man makes it bad for you to say ""I am not a man"".)"

297,pruss,feser,"Alexander R Pruss: ""there is no objective reason to do or believe anything""      You cannot believe anything at will. Nor are your choices to do something are ever free, even if they seem to be so. All your beliefs and choices to act are predetermined by your genetic makeup and past experiences, which express themselves in the current emotional/cognitive (that is, biochemical) state of your brain. This hypothesis is simpler than to suppose some immaterial stuff, whose interaction with material things, including the brain, would be beyond comprehension.   Also note that being rational is not somehow ""inherently better"" than being irrational or arational. Rather, it's just that rationality is the kind of attitude that pays off most of the time in the long run. And even this ""paying-off"" translates to things that support the survival of the individual, so it can be expressed in value-neutral terms.      ""every reason expresses the value of the thing it is a reason for""   This is false.   For example, if you know that p, and also know that ""if p, then q"", then this knowledge, together with knowledge of the rule of inference ""modus ponens"" may be a reason for you to believe (and, also know) that q. But there is nothing that expresses the ""value of q"" in the state of knowing p, ""if p, then q"", or in knowing ""modus ponens"", nor in its application. They are just propositions, syntactic structures with semantic interpretation according to classical logic. And there are many other alternative systems of logic, even some where modus ponens is not a theorem."
423,pruss,feser,"According to Catholic corruptionists, when I die, my soul will continue to exist, but I won’t; then at the Resurrection, I will come back into existence, receiving my soul back. In the interim, however, it is my soul, not I, who will enjoy heaven, struggle in purgatory or suffer in hell."

438,feser,pruss,"""to answer the unanswerable and know the unknowable""      Uh... before you claim something is ""unanswerable"" and ""unknowable"" you must first try to know it, and try to find answers.      And if you can't know it, and can't give any answers, that doesn't mean others are as incapable as you. Ironically, your position lacks humility. You should be more humble in recognizing that what is ""unanswearable"" and ""unknowable"" for you might really be just that: unanswerable and unknowable FOR YOU. Not necessarily for others."
210,feser,pruss,"@Dominik A form refers to the ""whatness"" of an object, meaning its essential characteristic or defining feature that gives it its specific nature or identity. This ""whatness"" can only be known by a cognitive agent and is present in both material and immaterial entities. It cannot be object of experience, as an instrument of measure is not a cognitive agent as such (but our five senses, obviously)."
731,pruss,feser,"@Alex I think an important nuance here is that in this specific view of participation, goodness-by-participation isn't actually **true or intrinsic** goodness. But this is problematic because we do have other verses affirming the true goodness of creatures, such as Genesis 1 explicitly affirms this, as does 1 Timothy 4 (first four verses on marriage & food) and Matthew 10 (sparrows).      The main problem would be that this view of participationism _wouldn't just make it impossible_ to take pride or ""brag"" about something we did (which I can concede is wrong), but that it also makes it impossible to actually say we are good or have value as well. In the **same manner & for the same reasons** we can't take pride in or brag about our actions, we also can't affirm we are **good,** or have being, and this seems to be a big problem with that specific account.      And it's also important to point out that Scripture often uses **hyperbolic negation** or hyperbolic merism - God for example in Jeremiah 7:22 apparently denies He ever commanded the Hebrews to do sacrifice, yet that's not a literal negation but a hyperbolic one to point out that loving God is more important - rhetorically DENYING one thing to point out the greater importance of another, without intending to truly deny the importance of the secondary. Same thing with loving Christ & hating one's parents - intentionally hyperbolic contrasts that actually convey a hierarchy of love, but not pure exclusivity.      So basing a very specific view of participationism (because not all models of participationism would agree that we aren't actually truly good) on a phrase that is likely using intentional rhetorical hyperbole is more speculative than solid."
796,pruss,feser,"Unknown      I wouldn't say ""forced"" is the correct word here, but it is true that God _necessarily_ loves you. So, in a sense, God _did/does_ have to love you."

1243,pruss,feser,"The code uses [webpxmux.js](https://github.com/sumimakito/webpxmux.js), though it was a little bit tricky because in-browser Javascript may not have enough memory to store all the uncompressed images that webpxmux.js needs to generate an animation. So instead I encode each frame to WebP using webpxmux.js, extract the compressed ALPH and VP8 chunks from the WebP file, and store only the compressed chunks, writing them all at the end. (It would be even better from the memory point of view to write the chunks one by one rather than storing them in memory, but a WebP file has a filesize in its header, and that’s not known until all the compressed chunks have been generated. One could get around this limitation by generating the video twice, but that would be twice as slow.)"

83,pruss,feser,"Neither implication can be reversed. To see this, consider the single- proposition case, where _Ω_ has two points, say 0 and 1, and _H_ and _F_ are the powerset of _Ω_ , and we are interested in the proposition that one of these point, say 1, is the actual truth. The scoring rule _s_ is then equivalent to a pair of functions _T_ and _F_ on [0,1] where _T_ ( _x_ ) = _s_ ( _p_ _x_ )(1) and _F_ ( _x_ ) = _s_ ( _p_ _x_ )(0) where _p_ _x_ is the probability that assigns _x_ to the point 1. Then _G_ _s_ corresponds to the function _x_ _T_ ( _x_ ) + (1− _x_ ) _F_ ( _x_ ), and each is convex if and only if the other is."
679,pruss,feser,"Alex      How does it follow from the idea that God is not simple that God’s beliefs change as the reality they are about changes?      If (2) is true, isn't that a problem for divine simplicity as well? For on divine simplicity, God id identical to God's beliefs, so if (2) is true it seems that God changes as the reality changes, which conradicts divine simplicity as well as divine immutability."

583,pruss,feser,"I've wondered about such incompossible goods myself. Weightlifting can reduce agility, for example, and while being tall is great for basketball, it is not good for weightlifting. Various niches seem to exist. It does raise the question of what a perfect human being consists of, however. Are some of these ""perfections"" merely accidental in the sense that they exploit what are normatively speaking (in relation to human nature) flaws? We know some sports are actually bad for the human body, or neglect the overall health of the body. Certain perfections seem to be perfections only in an analogical sense, perhaps something along the lines of being a ""good thief"" or an ""effective deceiver"".      Where intelligence is concerned, I am tempted to argue against incompossible goods either because intelligence isn't like that or for similar natural law reasons, but even more strongly, especially on account of the centrality of intelligence to humanity.      Consider your favorite déformation professionnelle, which, I submit, is more of a result of imprudence, habit, ignorance, lack of practice using other methods, and even effeminacy and arrogance. Someone with a rigorous philosophical education is less likely to try to pigeonhole reality into the reductive and simplified straitjacket of our physical models in the manner of at least some physicists who generally lack serious exposure to philosophy and may even hold it in contempt out of ignorance. A physicist may also be tempted to pigeonhole simply because of pride; if he isn't any good at metaphysics, then his thoughts on a metaphysical subject matter aren't likely to be very valuable or interesting, and that stings the prideful man accustomed to feeling like a hotshot. There is also the threat of seeing one's own field put in its methodological place, so to speak, deflating any pretensions to the kind of ultimacy that metaphysics lays claim to. A competent physics may also derive greater pleasure from exercising his specialized competence and choose his methods simply on the basis of what feels good and now what is called for by a problem. So here the question resurfaces: is there an incompossibility between being a good physicist and a good metaphysician? I suspect there isn't intrinsically, even if that is often the case which I suspect is rather a result of how one's time is spent. But even if it is the case, because general knowledge is superior and more worthy of human attention than specialized knowledge, we could argue that competence in physics that occurs at the expense of philosophical depth is, in fact, a kind of failure to attain human excellence by failing to devote proportional attention and effort to the kinds of knowledge that are most essential, and in doing so, risking intellectual deformation in important and even necessary matters."

30,pruss,feser,"Pruss: Does the materialist at least grant that the vocabulary of atomic physics is insufficient to say everything that can truthfully be said? For example, statements about enzymes catalyzing particular reactions (or, worse yet, being ""life-sustaining"") are not sayable in the vocabularly of atomic physics."
310,pruss,feser,"1) I think the participationism explanation is problematic, since by that same logic one could maybe deny one truly possesses being or goodness or value; one could even deny one causes anything at all, concluding occasionalism. But we do have our own being & goodness, so it's not the divine being & goodness in us, per Aquinas.         2) In fact, there's a real sense in which our actions & thereby accomplishments are uniquely our own in a way they aren't God's precisely because our actions are rooted in our secondary causality, which is distinct from God's causality. And secondary causality being distinct from primary causality, the causal responsibility for secondary causal acts is in the creature, since the primary causality of God in sustaining our actions in existence only determins them insofar as they exist, but we determine them insofar as whether we cause them to occur (the occurrence of them is distinct from their basic existence) and what we cause to occur.      3) Additionally, there may be a difference between bragging and general pride - some moral theology manuals seem to suggest being proud of one's accomplishments isn't sinful, because that's distinct from bragging morally. And one can't be proud of things one doesn't truly possess or cause in some way.      Of course, other sources say any form of pride is sinful, so this isn't a clear issue it seems - but if one did take the route that some forms of pride ARE morally okay, then this makes the thesis we don't possess anything, whether being or our actions, unlikely."
