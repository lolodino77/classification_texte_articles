432,feser,pruss,"People who promote racist obsession are all of them the enemies of human advancement, peace and cooperation. For one, American laws are not racist. They are anti-poor, which is very different. They have been that way since King Henry VIII. Hundreds of thousands of Americans died to end racist laws.      One of the diseases infecting America and the West is the consequence of allowing actually racist states like China and Israel into our politics. Until we either excommunicate them for barbarism or enforce on them like we did the South equality under the law the polarization of our politics and the pseudo- intellectual race bating will continue and intensify."
198,pruss,feser,"In One Body: An Essay in Christian Sexual Ethics, I recall you arguing for a 'strong ethics of love' such that all moral facts in some sense follow from the fundamental duty to love (or even that they are this duty taking other forms). It's been a while since I read that chapter, but that seems like a tighter unificatory structure than you're posing here, so have your views changed since then or is a strong ethics of love compatible with this looser structure?"
668,feser,pruss,"But Judaism isn't for ""people"". It's for the Jews, theoretically. At least I haven't noticed any proselytism by this religion."
684,pruss,feser,"My claim was only that typically you learn something in favor of p by being told that p is true. There are, of course, exceptions (e.g., if you know that someone is going to be lying, in which case their saying something is evidence that they disbelieve it, which in turn is evidence against it).      That said, that an intelligent person believes a clear and explicit contradiction may be some very slight evidence against the law of noncontradiction."
933,feser,pruss,"Miguel Cervantes, you fail to even imagine that I might have actually read Kendi's and Stefancic's contributions.   Please, don't stick your presumptive ignorance in the middle of your forehead."
959,feser,pruss,"According to conventional American history, the USA became great because it was a self-made country built by the Protestant work ethic. According to Dr. Martin Luther King the USA became great because we exploited black slaves and poor immigrants. :)"
261,pruss,feser,Such theories of salvation have the following unsavory consequence: they imply that it would be possible for us to be saved by a monkey.
522,feser,pruss," _Therefore, accrediting to them (or suspecting of them) a ""hope"" for only few saved is entirely out of order._      It was meant to be an ironical remark, not an accusation. I know nobody hopes most people to be damned. I think."
858,pruss,feser,"This fine point doesn’t affect anything I said about independence, given the standard mathematical definition thereof. But there is an intuitive sense of independence in which we can now see that the bits are _not_ independent. For instance, while each bit can be 1 on its own, it is impossible to have all the bits be 1 (this is actually impossible regardless of how I decided on choosing the expansion, because _x_ = 1 is excluded), and indeed impossible to have all the bits be 1 from some point on. There is a very subtle dependence between the bits that we cannot define within classical probability, a dependence that would be lacking if we tossed an infinite number of ""really"" independent fair coins."
693,feser,pruss,"Now, just to finish what I have been saying if all this they wrote is true - besides the fact that is bizarre to say - would imply that our unity is an accidental one - or that legs, arms, liver, etc., just because they're different (i.e made of different cells) and comes from [insert the natural selection argument here] in different periods of times and because they are made of cells - that really 'work' as individuals - are co-opted to do what they do. So, in fact, what they are saying is that we are just an aggregate! And that sounds odd.      And when we come to measure all this (presupposing again all of this is right) it seems quite mysterious why in the heck cells 'come together' or were 'co- opted' to form a leg, say, or an organ - that is, to serve a bigger purpose. Do you guys get what I mean? If they were in fact the 'individuals' (the cells or whatever), why come together to form an 'illusion' of one (human being)? That doesn't seem right."
835,feser,pruss," _The fact that it is private is irrelevant to whether he is teaching, and to whether he intends the recipient to receiving this and be guided by it._      It is certainly very relevant when discussing if anybody should be bound to this teaching or whether he is writing a simple advice letter."

581,pruss,feser,I have no idea if anything like this transfer works for other people.
631,feser,pruss,"Talmid      I do not know which is older. If Irenaeus took Divine simplicity for granted and on the basis of that rejcted gnosticism, then gnosticism seems older than Irenaeus's belief."
783,feser,pruss,"Michael      Your argument (and Feser's) is that the laws of logic (or numbers) _necessarily_ depend on God's eternal and necessary mind.   But therein lies the problem I mentioned.   If it is true that the laws of logic are necessary parts of God's mind, then that means there is a law of logic that says the laws of logic are part of God's mind, but that particular law of logic that says this, is not part of God's mind, because God's mind necessarily having those laws depends on the laws of logic.   IOW, this position is self-defeating and it's in fact your emperor that has no clothes.      If you don't believe me, just answer the question why the possibility of square circles cannot be a part of God's eternal mind."
120,feser,pruss,"Sometimes it seems like traditionalists swing to the opposite end of the pendulum: ""dare we hope that all non-canonized past the age of reason are damned?"""
705,pruss,feser,"If there are certain conditions that people have to live by in order to he saved, and some written texts presents exactly those conditions, then I don't see why people living by those conditions would not be saved."
536,pruss,feser,"On reflection, the phenomenon in the first sentence of the post isn't odd at all. Typically if someone tells you something, that is evidence for what they tell you, even if you know it's not true."
298,feser,pruss,Even that was not the end of it. The [Seventh Ecumenical Council](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3819.htm) of 787 A.D. (also known as the Second Council of Nicaea) reiterated the previous council’s condemnation:

588,pruss,feser,"what about emergent properties? ex. atoms, neurons, Brians, consciousness. Similar to other parts for what makes a human being"
178,pruss,feser,"Could it be that the epistemic responsibility is to ""go where the evidence points"", and that Bayesianism is just the most rigorous form of that? It would be like saying that we ought to measure carefully when cutting the pieces to build someone's house, but that we can only do as well as our available instruments let us, and that that is sufficient. Bayesian reasoning as such may not be an ""available instrument"" for most of us, but we ought to approximate it as much as we can.      I think Steven Pinker just wrote a book in which he equates rationality with something like Bayesianism. I haven't read it yet, but it's on my list!"
371,feser,pruss,"How confident are you that a) your reading represents the view of the book, and b) that the papacy was uninterested as opposed to ill-informed or silent (per your expectations) for other reasons?"
1024,pruss,feser,"Hello, Dr. Pruss. It seems like you used a lot of ideas in your blog for this lecture!   I have a few questions. First, how is your book going? I saw you haven't updated it in a while. Have you seen Joe Schmid's new book that is coming out? It's about classical theism and existential inertia. I know you have a paper about divine conservation coming up, so I would like to hear some arguments against existential inertia. Moreover, there is a book with an essay by you in it: Classical Theism by Routledge. In it, you argue for divine simplicity. Can you tell me about some arguments in it?   https://www.amazon.com/Existential-Inertia-Classical-Theistic- Proofs/dp/3031193121/"
204,feser,pruss,"To bring this post down to where the rubber meets the road, I have a boss who is ""married"" to a person of the same sex. Am I to understand this post correctly as to be saying I have an obligation to tell her that she is living in sin, despite the consequences to my ability to do or keep my job?"
250,feser,pruss,   I suppose I will get around to responding to this or not.   You Rule Ed!      Cheers sir.
902,feser,pruss,Critical race theory is based on the false assumption the differential outcomes are due to systemic racism and injustice. It follows organically from that premise.     
155,feser,pruss,"It's not even obvious to me that we aren't making a category error by using the term suffering univocally between humans and animals. Since we definitely don't think (unless we're PETA weirdos) that we can apply concepts like justice to animas in the same way that we apply it to humans, and that suffering necessarily includes some component of injustice, I don't think we've clearly defined what sorts of pain they animals experience ought to properly qualify as suffering in a sense relevant to this discussion."
