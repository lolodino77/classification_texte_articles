743,pruss,feser,I love reductions. But alas it looks to me like reasons and goods are not reducible in either direction.
428,feser,pruss,I never make rash judgements because I always have good reasons for beliefs. Now those other guys...
670,feser,pruss,@Michael      Is that not Greg Bahnsen? I remember this coming up in one of his debates.
231,pruss,feser,But I’ve been trying really hard to figure out how is it that such a conventional behavior would indicate to Bob that the lion is on the left path.
991,feser,pruss,"@ Infinite_Growth,      We cannot stop the sin without punishing the sinner. A person who murders people must be judged of murdering people, by the proper authorities, and stopped. Locking up the murderer, eg, is punishment of the murderer.      Tom Cohoe  "
990,feser,pruss,"Wrong question.   Right one: can any pope be defended? Sure. They only do and say what they are supposed to do and say, based on interests, preferences and motives---   some of which change, with changes in interests, preferences and motives..."
110,pruss,feser,"This is a fun puzzle. It seems like David Lewis’ convention work, or Thomas Schelling’s coordination and focal points stuff must be relevant."

785,pruss,feser,"P1 seems to beg the question, no? If materialism (which I'm taking to mean ""objects have no parts in addition to their material/atomic parts"") is true, then P1 would be like saying ""a typical human being has much more intrinsic value than any human-sized object""...."
679,feser,pruss,"Good to see you back again, George M/Talmid. Good point there! By all means write again."
29,feser,pruss," _According to the Chicago Manual of Style, if the last part of your sentence is a quotation, you put the period inside of the quotation, not outside._      I strenuously and aggressively resist this ""rule"". It's a bad rule, and should be shouted down by right-thinking writers. If the quotation you are citing has the period, the period should go inside the quote. If the passage you are quoting does not have the period in it and your sentence is larger than merely the quote (i.e. has substantive words and phrases besides the quote), then the period belongs to YOUR sentence and NOT to the quote, and it should go outside the quote.      Putting the period always inside the quote _obscures_ content, without any offsetting benefit. The ""rule"", therefore, offers no value to writing. (Notice the comma, back there?)      I applaud anyone who fights back against this (one in a long line of arbitrary and abusive) assertions of ""rules"" that would never have become ""rules"" at all except for the insistence by yet earlier arbitrary and abusive grammarians."
667,feser,pruss,"@Tony:      ""In the above example given by our esteemed Anonymous above, if we assume 1=2, does it STILL remain true that ""equals subtracted from equals make equals"", which he uses to get the second step? Maybe not.""      The sentence between quotes is a special instance of ""substitution of equals"" principle; it can be stated as an implication ""forall x, y : x = y => f x = f y"" where f is a function (1), which in turn is a reflection of the mantra ""first order logic is extensional"".      Technical note(s):   (1) you can even universally quantify over f, which redounds to the indiscernability of identicals; but then, depending on how exactly you are setting things up, you are moving to second order logic which is generally not a good idea because important results like the compactness theorem fail; but this can be worked around in a number of ways."
525,pruss,feser,"what about emergent properties? ex. atoms, neurons, Brians, consciousness. Similar to other parts for what makes a human being"
945,pruss,feser,"Yes, though I admit it might be difficult to define ""sufficient opportunity"" in practice without smuggling in implicit assumptions that risk reducing the inductive argument to circularity. In other words, if what allows us to judge the sufficiency of opportunity to find a cause is related to how ever much effort it takes to successfully find such a cause, my (c) becomes ""We consistently find causes for things that come to be when we have investigated their origins up to the point when we find causes for them"", which is tautological.      The trick would be to define ""sufficient opportunity"" rigorously without unintentionally sneaking in the epistemic assumptions we are trying to ground. And, even if we succeed in doing so, I suspect that in the real world, both the common folk and academics, especially in science, are accepting C in practice at least, and without such a strictly valid and non-circular grounding. To put it another way, I believe there is at least as much faith/intuition as reason (in the narrow sense) subjectively underlying both C and the confidence in nomic inferences to which ASBB refers."
789,pruss,feser,"In One Body: An Essay in Christian Sexual Ethics, I recall you arguing for a 'strong ethics of love' such that all moral facts in some sense follow from the fundamental duty to love (or even that they are this duty taking other forms). It's been a while since I read that chapter, but that seems like a tighter unificatory structure than you're posing here, so have your views changed since then or is a strong ethics of love compatible with this looser structure?"
548,pruss,feser,"Daryl:      I was just thinking that Matthew's ""sufficiently detailed understanding of the nature of the human species"" would require not just a descriptive but also a normative understanding. For instance, it's important that not only do humans tend to have hearts and lungs, but that they ought to have them."
501,feser,pruss,"I agree and I even came up with a very similar argument myself. I think that if there is an intelligent first cause that is free, then creation can only make sense as a choice for that being if it is truly valuable. Otherwise the first cause has no reason whatsoever for choosing to create anything. It can't be lonely, bored, etc. If it acts, it does so rationally. So there must be true value, and then our ordinary claims of moral knowledge would fit pretty well."
634,pruss,feser,"Another thought: I suspect that the inference to the existence of a cause is on an epistemic par with an inference to the consistency of some event with the laws of nature.      For any of the unfathomably large number of episodes of motion I observe, how on Earth do I know that they're actually consistent with the laws? Think of the water falling from my shower head, the ambulance of an old man through a doorway, or the slide of a coffee cup from the counter to my hand. Do I really know that those motions were consistent with the laws instead of one of an infinity of possible ways that could technically violate those laws? I don't know the details of the motion, and I don't even know how to check if those details - even if I knew them - were consistent with the laws. But I infer that they are. This seems totally legitimate on whatever epistemic grounds exist for the scientists who conclude what the laws are.      Now, (a) and (b) become (a*) We know of many events that conform to the laws and (b*) there are many events for which we have no idea if they conform to the laws. All the same arguments seemingly can be run (with the exception of the no probability argument) against the view that our nomic beliefs are correct.      It seems that the denial of our causal inferences are no worse off than our nomic inferences."
896,feser,pruss,Cyberpunk is based. Tranhumanism is for snowflakes.      I have spoken.
833,feser,pruss,   I suppose I will get around to responding to this or not.   You Rule Ed!      Cheers sir.
979,feser,pruss,"Augustine is especially hard on Christians (such as clergy) who do not have family obligations and the like to worry about, yet still shrink from doing their duty to condemn the wickedness that surrounds them:"
523,pruss,feser,"For physics, is ‘contingencies of arrangements of stuff’ enough? I would think we would also need ‘contingencies of _kinds_ of stuff’. So if there were a particle just like an electron but with a charge sqrt(2) times as big, the laws of physics might still be the same but the behavior of matter would be very different. If so, I’m not sure the moral laws are all that different. You might not be able to derive all the moral laws pertaining to human animals straight from the categorical imperative alone (or whatever other law you take to be fundamental), but you can (can’t you?) derive it from a combination of the categorical imperative and a sufficiently detailed understanding of the nature of the human species. What would be the problem with saying that?"
