599,feser,pruss,"I like ""argumentation ethics."" It's the ""presuppositions apologetics"" of libertarianism.      The Virgin rationalist vs. The Chad circular logician"
429,feser,pruss,"@ Norm,      ""(Followed by Loud Cheers)""      There were no loud cheers for harsh punishment. You misreport and miscast Ed's words for some purpose of your own.      "" 'don't worry, those who made those statements will be brutally punishment' ""      He didn't say that. You're attacking a straw man.      Tom Cohoe  "

1008,feser,pruss,Can someone recommend a more beginner level essay on this topic? Infest this might be too meaty and am a little wary of purchasing it
993,pruss,feser,The physical Church-Turing (PCT) thesis says that anything that can be physically computed can be computed by a Turing machine.
174,pruss,feser,"Hi Professor Pruss. My apologies if this is off topic, but I wanted to ask a question about the Eucharist. Specifically, what do you think of the claim that it is metaphysically impossible for accidents to exist in the absence of the substance of which they are accidents? Also, do you have any particular objections to the consubstantiation view common among Anglo-Catholics (including myself)?"
120,pruss,feser,"I climbed in sets of 10. The planned pace was 8:18 per set and a 44-45 second rest between sets (clock runs during rests,), averaging at 49.8 seconds per climb including descent. I was always ahead of pace, and I occasionally took a mini break at the mid-point time if I was too far ahead."
507,pruss,feser,Alex      If we do not have autonome rights against God we don not really have autonome rights at all.   And whether they context is sacred it not is irrelevant. What is relevant is consent. Consesual sex is not rape even though sex itself may be a sacred context.
425,feser,pruss,"Augustine is especially hard on Christians (such as clergy) who do not have family obligations and the like to worry about, yet still shrink from doing their duty to condemn the wickedness that surrounds them:"
357,pruss,feser,Isn't the reason that you wouldn't care what happens to your body after you die is not just that it's not a part of you when it happens but also that the part of you that would normally feel the pain (if you were burned/decayed/dissected) doesn't.      With the soul you (run with me for a little on this) would suffer/struggle/enjoy the afterlife. Now obviously you on curroptionism wouldn't suffer/struggle/enjoy but the part of you that normally would feel the pain does. And so the special care may still be applied under curroptionism.
60,pruss,feser,"Hello, Dr. Pruss. It seems like you used a lot of ideas in your blog for this lecture!   I have a few questions. First, how is your book going? I saw you haven't updated it in a while. Have you seen Joe Schmid's new book that is coming out? It's about classical theism and existential inertia. I know you have a paper about divine conservation coming up, so I would like to hear some arguments against existential inertia. Moreover, there is a book with an essay by you in it: Classical Theism by Routledge. In it, you argue for divine simplicity. Can you tell me about some arguments in it?   https://www.amazon.com/Existential-Inertia-Classical-Theistic- Proofs/dp/3031193121/"
808,pruss,feser,"Michael Huemer advances a version of this argument in his ""Ethical Intuitionism"", somewhere around page 180 or 190 or the like (I don't have the book in front of me, sorry). I forget the exact details, but it may be worth checking out what he said."
940,pruss,feser,"On reflection, it is easy enough to get around my worry just by eliminating the word ‘much’ from the first premise. I think the argument would go through just as well. But I’m still puzzled about how to think of intrinsic value in parts."
924,pruss,feser,"If there are certain conditions that people have to live by in order to he saved, and some written texts presents exactly those conditions, then I don't see why people living by those conditions would not be saved."
853,pruss,feser,"Another family of goods, though, are necessary goods. That God exists is good, but it is necessarily true. That various mathematical theorems are beautiful is necessarily true. Yet no one has reason to promote a necessary truth."
903,feser,pruss,"Kant seems to consider that phenomena has a lower degree of existence than the thing-itself while considering phenomena real, so it will depend on the view that one takes on the relation between the two.      If we take a two-worlds interpretation them i suppose that both phenomena and noumena ""are"" but on diferent ways, so we need something like analogy. If we take a two-aspects interpretation them it seems like they are just one thing, so there is only a mode of existence. If we take something like S. Gardner view, that we dont know the relation at all, them who knows."
371,pruss,feser,"This fine point doesn’t affect anything I said about independence, given the standard mathematical definition thereof. But there is an intuitive sense of independence in which we can now see that the bits are _not_ independent. For instance, while each bit can be 1 on its own, it is impossible to have all the bits be 1 (this is actually impossible regardless of how I decided on choosing the expansion, because _x_ = 1 is excluded), and indeed impossible to have all the bits be 1 from some point on. There is a very subtle dependence between the bits that we cannot define within classical probability, a dependence that would be lacking if we tossed an infinite number of ""really"" independent fair coins."
94,pruss,feser,"P1 seems to beg the question, no? If materialism (which I'm taking to mean ""objects have no parts in addition to their material/atomic parts"") is true, then P1 would be like saying ""a typical human being has much more intrinsic value than any human-sized object""...."
430,pruss,feser,"I've wondered about such incompossible goods myself. Weightlifting can reduce agility, for example, and while being tall is great for basketball, it is not good for weightlifting. Various niches seem to exist. It does raise the question of what a perfect human being consists of, however. Are some of these ""perfections"" merely accidental in the sense that they exploit what are normatively speaking (in relation to human nature) flaws? We know some sports are actually bad for the human body, or neglect the overall health of the body. Certain perfections seem to be perfections only in an analogical sense, perhaps something along the lines of being a ""good thief"" or an ""effective deceiver"".      Where intelligence is concerned, I am tempted to argue against incompossible goods either because intelligence isn't like that or for similar natural law reasons, but even more strongly, especially on account of the centrality of intelligence to humanity.      Consider your favorite déformation professionnelle, which, I submit, is more of a result of imprudence, habit, ignorance, lack of practice using other methods, and even effeminacy and arrogance. Someone with a rigorous philosophical education is less likely to try to pigeonhole reality into the reductive and simplified straitjacket of our physical models in the manner of at least some physicists who generally lack serious exposure to philosophy and may even hold it in contempt out of ignorance. A physicist may also be tempted to pigeonhole simply because of pride; if he isn't any good at metaphysics, then his thoughts on a metaphysical subject matter aren't likely to be very valuable or interesting, and that stings the prideful man accustomed to feeling like a hotshot. There is also the threat of seeing one's own field put in its methodological place, so to speak, deflating any pretensions to the kind of ultimacy that metaphysics lays claim to. A competent physics may also derive greater pleasure from exercising his specialized competence and choose his methods simply on the basis of what feels good and now what is called for by a problem. So here the question resurfaces: is there an incompossibility between being a good physicist and a good metaphysician? I suspect there isn't intrinsically, even if that is often the case which I suspect is rather a result of how one's time is spent. But even if it is the case, because general knowledge is superior and more worthy of human attention than specialized knowledge, we could argue that competence in physics that occurs at the expense of philosophical depth is, in fact, a kind of failure to attain human excellence by failing to devote proportional attention and effort to the kinds of knowledge that are most essential, and in doing so, risking intellectual deformation in important and even necessary matters."
731,pruss,feser,"No, I don’t think so. I mean, I think that in most contexts, it would be fine to _say_ that there is a single, cube-shaped lodestone (1×1×1) and a field that extends beyond it. But I have real doubts that this way of talking works here.      Here is an analogy. The question of where I am could be taken to be asking either where my principal activity takes place or else where all of my activities take place. According to the first way, I am where my brain is. According to the second way, I am where my entire body is. But it is the latter, holistic answer, that is more fundamental.   On this analogy, the cube-shaped lodestone is like the brain; its magnetic field is like the whole body. The substance as a whole has one small, localized activity and another activity that is more spread out. The answer to the question, “Where is the magnet?” depends on which activity you have in mind, but the more fundamental version of the question concerns all of its activities rather than some of its limited, localized activities.      What am I missing? How else does a substance get its ‘where’?"
650,pruss,feser,"But if ""Meadow's law"" is no longer a law, then why are so many theists and apologists so fond of [Plantinga's poker analogy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDBkmpm-APE&t=757s)?!?   I guess, because even though they can not correctly and properly Bayesian reason and therefore shouldn't do it, they are doing it regardless of the possibility of them being so irrational with it.  "
227,pruss,feser,"As we say in Australia, you are 'a gun'! Have you ever thought about writing philosophically about climbing? Perhaps even just in the vaguely existential vein that Murakami mines in his 'What I Talk About When I Talk About Running'."
