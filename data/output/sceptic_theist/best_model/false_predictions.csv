1448,sceptic,theist,I agree. I have addressed Plantinga’s Ontological Argument and a modal version before. I touch on precisely that: asserting that god is a necessary being is begging the question; it’s not an established truth the way Christians would like to believe.
3958,sceptic,theist,3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.
426,sceptic,theist,"Suppose a version of neo-classical theism is true. Then, all changes in things _other_ _than_ God are explained in terms of God’s initial free choice to create in combination with God’s continuously performed free choice(s) to sustain objects and cause (perhaps via concurrence with creaturely causality) their changes. Moreover, suppose God changes in performing such choices. Such changes are not inexplicable; they are explained in terms of more fundamental features of God, e.g., God’s desires, reasons, beliefs, character, goodness, and the like, or perhaps in terms of God _qua_ agent. Thus, under this view, no change or actualization of potential goes unexplained, _and yet there is no purely actual being_."
2414,sceptic,theist,"Prajāpati also equates ātman with consciousness, but crucially, he also conflates it with the material body. Prajāpati, therefore, presents a strain of another school in Vedānta, namely Dvaita, which is dualistic. In a sense, it is a dualism of mind and body or consciousness and the material, but more importantly, it is a dualism of jīva and the Brahman, e.g., humankind and God. Given Prajāpati’s distinction, we see the beginnings of monotheism or henotheism, and the much later _bhakti_ tradition in Hinduism in where a devotee of a given god is to unite their soul to this god by way of their love and devotion. Though there are other interpretations of ātman and Brahman in Hinduism, Advaita and Dvaita suffice for our purposes."
969,sceptic,theist,"I have a strong conviction in my views and I will argue tooth and nail to beat someone out views that contradict my own because I recognize the real-world impact the views of my opponents have. I recognize that if anti-natalists had any real conviction, they would not be pro-choice and they would ensure the extinction of the human species and, in fact, every species on the planet. If a drosophila is born to live two measly months give or take, what is the point? If an elephant calf is born to be eaten by a pride of lions the next day, then what is the point? Suffering in the animal kingdom far exceeds human suffering. Whales are poached in droves in some parts of the world; overfishing is a common problem as well. We should not want for these species to procreate, according to the anti-natalist. If we extrapolate your conclusions onto other species, the world will be practically lifeless, save for the microbes and viruses we fail to command."

2486,theist,sceptic,"The trouble with this sort of reasoning, Kant thinks, is not that its conclusion is false – again, he was no atheist – but rather that, given his epistemology, reason lacks the resources to transcend the empirical world and prove the existence of a necessary or unconditioned being outside it. The notion of causality, he argues, applies only _within_ the phenomenal world, the world of things as they appear to us, whereas reasoning to a necessary being would require applying it beyond that world, to the noumenal world or things as they are in themselves. And we cannot, in his view, know the latter."

381,theist,sceptic,"""It may matter for LFW where that Will came from, but it doesn't matter for my argument.""      How does it not matter for your argument, if whether or not the model counts as LFW depends on it? Of course if there is such a thing as this ""Will"" which determinately lead to vanilla rather than chocolate, we must be the ones to cause such a Will. Otherwise, again, we are in no control whatsoever of our actions - a Will just emerges (uncaused by us, hence beyond our choice or control) which then causes our actions. Of course it matters for your argument, since if your model is unacceptable for libertarian freedom proponents then it won't work as a defense against my claim (that LFW for humans already involves the issue of an agent being able to cause 2 distinct effects without a change in intrinsic properties).      ""What matters is that there is a Will to do X. And a will to do X is not thé same as a Will to do not X.""      And the problem - to repeat myself again - is that if we are to maintain libertarian freedom, we have to have caused this Will. Otherwise the Will- for-X just emerges beyond our control and determines that we do X, and this is no libertarian freedom.      But if we cause the Will-to-X we cannot require a further, second order Will- to-will-to-X, otherwise we end up in a regress. That's been my point for a while now. So it turns out that this ""Will"" isn't really required for our choices. It's a confused notion that would lead to an infinite, vicious regress.      The existence of a Will-to-X becomes superfluous, since even on the assumption that it exists we must be able to choose and cause it (or the Will-to-not-X) without requiring a further second order Will. So it turns out this ""Will"" is not really required for free actions. In the end, LFW requires that an agent be able to choose and cause X or ~X without a difference in intrinsic properties. If there is a Will-to-X, it does not determine X, and is not incompatible with the possession of a Will-to-not-X."

787,theist,sceptic,I think that William Lane Craig explained in a debate that only a small minority of mankind was born before Jesus.

Furthermore, that we can’t understand why bad things happen to good people, why the wicked prosper, and why so much suffering on earth seems to be without a purpose _itself_ causes even more suffering. Again, God is the author of this confusion. We might interrogate the point further since so many have lost their faith, and consequently, are now burning in hell. Manufacturing a problem where there isn’t one is baffling enough; but in this context, where the stakes are so high, it’s worse than confusing. It’s monstrous."
5514,sceptic,theist,"At first glance, this might be a reframing of Kant’s phenomena and noumena, but it is useful to note that Sellars’ manifest and scientific images would both be categorized as phenomena. On Kant, the scientific image would not qualify as noumena. Some modern day philosophers, taking after Donald Hoffman, a professor at the University of California Irvine, have it that we have evolved in such a way that we are pretty much shielded from apprehending ultimate reality, i.e., the Kantian noumena (Frank, Adam. [“What If Evolution Bred Reality Out Of Us?”](https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2016/09/06/492779594/what-if- evolution-bred-reality-out-of- us?utm_content=buffere3054&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer) _NPR_. 6 Sep 2016.

3523,theist,sceptic,"(last one)      But at the same time, there is a problem with me I couldn't help but think that what if I got them all wrong? What if their arguments are plausible at all? I'm not a philosopher, just a normal guy. And I want to confess something: even though I do not think that something like that (buddhism) is plausible at all, I am afraid of the possibility that it could be because I am ignorant and my OCD does not let me go through this. It was a lot hard to write all these comments - since I am struggling with myself to even conclude a thought. There were a lot more - and a lot more detailed criticism - that I want to write but I simply can't (especially a topic at 4.5 that's the most important part of all it but I don't have the necessary strength and a point that I tried to make à-la Aristotelian retortion in the sense that they must presuppose permanence and can't get rid of it in making their arguments in the same way that Alex Rosenberg can't get rid of intentionality when trying to 'naturalize intentionality').      And for those of you who think: ""why buddhism bothers you that much?"" The answer should be self-evident by now (and for reasons that make simple materialism looks like a weekend at the beach): look at the consequences of all that. There would be no persons, no things, and in some way just suffering. Life would be just horrible. There would be illusions all around us. All persons would be substances per accident - and that's just awful and I can't believe that there are people who find this idea pleasing. And the other reason is OCD. Looks like nothing that I could present by myself is ever sufficient to disprove them. Looks like my arguments are never enough - and since I'm just illiterate in philosophy there is a wall I could never cross.      Unfortunately, I came across buddhism by chance when I was fixated on the experiment of Benjamin Libet on free will (at least his sense of ""free will"") and stumbled across the work of Sam Harris arguing that since there was no free will there is the illusion of the self. Since I have OCD things don't 'go out' of my head that easily (like in the case of normal people). Since the idea per se is insane I tried to understand why people think that it's plausible in the first place. And by their paradoxical 'reductio' way of arguing and the abuse of science that they always propose (bearing in mind that I didn't know that there is such a thing as A-T Meta at the time) that stuck in my head and only got worse through the years.      So, I appreciate it if someone could help me with it. Even though it's not apparent, I tried to put a lot of effort into solving it. But I simply can't take it anymore and just reading something from that topic just brings me a lot of pain."

2099,theist,sceptic,"Since, therefore, he who was born of the barren woman preceded Him Who was born of the Virgin, and, in response to the salutation of her who was carrying the Lord, leaped in his mother’s womb before he saw the light of day, as soon as the Forerunner of the Word was born, the silence of Zacharias was thereupon loosed by prophetic inspiration. All that Zacharias recounted was a prophecy of the future. Therefore, guided to the knowledge of hidden things by the spirit of prophecy, and perceiving the mystery of virginity in the incorrupt birth, he did not exclude the unwedded Mother from that place in the Temple allotted by the Law to virgins, thereby teaching the Jews that the Creator of existing things and King of all creation has human nature subject to Himself, along with everything else, guiding it by His own Will as He sees fit, not being Himself mastered by it, so that it is in His power to create a new birth, which will not prevent her who has become a mother from remaining a virgin. For this reason, he did not exclude her, in the Temple, from the place of the virgins; this place was the space between the Temple and the altar. When the Jews heard that the King of creation, by Divine OEconomy, was about to undergo human birth, fearing lest they become subject to a king, they murdered the priest who bore witness to this birth as he was serving at the altar itself."

This is, Cartwright argues, especially likely in social science. She gives as an example the notion of _probability_. When we consider simple examples like pulling cards from a fair deck, the probabilities of various possible outcomes can be determined with precision.

I wouldn't call these religious beliefs, they are normative moral beliefs based on embryology and sociology. And since I hold them to be true obviously I would seek to convince others as well. But obviously through the democratic process, if the majority of the people happen to disagree with me and vote accordingly, I will respect that outcome and perhaps adopt a more grass roots approach to change that out come through the democratic approach.

If you take this position, you are stuck with a conception of matter that makes it impossible to regard consciousness as material. The solution, I would say, is simply not to go along with this assumption in the first place, but to return to the Aristotelian-Scholastic view the early moderns reacted against, and which is compatible with the commonsense view of matter. The so-called hard problem of consciousness then dissolves.""

The problem of evil (or at least the logical version of the problem of evil that you keep harping on about), is a philosophical demonstration that the existence of evil is inconsistent with God’s attributes of goodness, omnipotence, etc. If Plato’s good work an argument provides a potential “out” then the argument in the problem of evil fails because the conclusion does not follow from the premises.      Notice how in the thousands of words that Dr. Feser has devoted to the topic of existential inertia, he has never once asked “where is the hard evidence for existential inertia?” Because it doesn’t matter if you have independent reasons to think such a thing exists. If the mere possibility of it’s existence is consistent with the metaphysical premises of the classical theists, then (most) cosmological arguments fail.

Specifically, given a probability function _P_ and a probability discount threshold _ϵ_ , we form a credence function _P_ _ϵ_ by letting _P_ _ϵ_ ( _A_ ) = _P_ ( _A_ ) if _ϵ_ ≤ _P_ ( _A_ ) ≤ 1 − _ϵ_ , _P_ _ϵ_ ( _A_ ) = 0 if _P_ ( _A_ ) < _ϵ_ and _P_ _ϵ_ ( _A_ ) = 1 if _P_ ( _A_ ) > 1 − _ϵ_. This discounts close-to-zero probabilities to zero and raises close-to-one probabilities to one. (We shouldn’t forget the second or things won't work well.)"
4773,theist,sceptic,"   Hi Eric,      Now to address your other point on whether Jesus really meant for his followers (followers around AD30 and future generations after that) to “sell possessions” (Luke 12.33 & Luke 14.33):      Let us temporarily assume that Jesus’ words to the disciples and the crowd (Luke 12.33 and Luke 14.33) on “selling possessions to help the needy and thereby storing up treasures in heaven instead of storing up treasures on earth” have   (1) a 50% chance to mean either something else or to be not applicable to future generations of followers that come after the apostles’ generation   and   (2) a 50% probability to mean really “selling possessions to help the needy and thereby storing up treasures in heaven instead of storing up treasures on earth” for not only the apostle’s own generation but also the future generations of followers.      The disciples of the disciples of the apostles would probably have better understood Jesus’ intended meaning than other Christian’s who were born much later, and hence the teachings of the Christians from the first 300 years AD would tilt the above 50-50 balance towards one side.      Below are some quotes about Christians’ view of possessions from the first few centuries. (BTW these are not about Communism, in case anyone is saying that the early Christians were Communists. The early Christians were not telling the wider society to sell possessions or share properties/goods).      [To be continued in next post]      johannes y k hui"

5011,sceptic,theist,"Take the example of the daughter undergoing painful but necessary medical treatment. That’s essentially the situation theists claim that we’re in. Preventing apparently gratuitous suffering could be as foolish as preventing your daughter from getting the polio vaccine because it would be painful to get the vaccine. Of course you’d rather her take the shot to prevent the possibility of polio in the future, obviously. But if that’s the case with the evils of our world, you’d be profoundly foolish to try to do anything about them (or at least many of them)."
4860,theist,sceptic,"And because pure (Tarskian) geometry is decidable, while the theory of the positive integers is not decidable, the positive integers are not definable in terms of pure geometry, so we cannot eliminate the quantification over positive integers. In fact, it is known that the rational numbers are not definable in terms of pure geometry either, so neither the incommensurability formulation nor theory irrationality formulation is a purely geometric claim."
1543,sceptic,theist,"Critics of this argument will sometimes resist the theological premise, somewhat desperately, and go so far as to deny that we should expect Christians to stand out from non-Christians. This expectation, however, is not something atheists are pulling out of thin air – this is what my Christian community expected _of itself_! In my Protestant environment, faith over works was the standard view. But works, I was taught, arose naturally when one’s heart had truly been given over to God. Failing to bear these fruits or continuing in a life of sin was a definite sign that the Spirit was not in control – the Holy Spirit was not really having an influence over your life. If one had sincerely given your life over to Christ, one would see a difference manifest. Lack of moral and spiritual fruit was an ominous sign."
2960,theist,sceptic,"@Laudator Temporis Acti      There is nothing about your objection that logically limits its application to matters of religion - if it were valid, it would remove the possibility of objective certainty in any field of knowledge, since any assertion we made would always require the implicit qualification, 'But since I am fallible, I could be wrong about this' (even about e.g. 2+2=4).      I'll mention in passing - the objection, thus taken to its logical conclusion, would therefore appear to be self-refuting, because the objector puts forward the objection itself as objectively certain truth (not qualifying it as 'merely probable').      But be that as it may, I will try to show that (whether or not its conclusion is self-refuting) the objection is a logical fallacy.      This is its basic structure:      It is possible for beliefs of mine to be false.   X is a belief of mine.   Therefore it is possible that X is false.      Consider the parallel argument:      It is possible for cats to be black.   Fluffy is a cat.   Therefore it is possible that Fluffy is black [even though I can see she is white].      The reason that these arguments fail is that I can be aware of more about Fluffy than the fact that she is a cat, and I can be aware of more about 'X' than the fact that it is a belief of mine. If all we knew about Fluffy was that she was a cat, then it would be reasonable to say that it was possible that she was black. And if all we knew about X was that it was a belief of my fallible self, then it would be reasonable to say that X was possibly false.      But in fact, I can know from the evidence of my senses that in Fluffy's case, the abstract possibility for cats to be black is not fulfilled in her particular case. And I can know from direct knowledge of conclusive logical or factual evidence in the particular case of X (e.g. 2+2=4), that the abstract general possibility of my beliefs being false is not fulfilled in the particular case of my belief X.      This is why the general fallibility that is ours as humans does not prove the impossibility of individuals reaching valid objective certainty in particular cases, where the individual is aware of sufficient evidence for the belief.      So there is no reason in principle why an individual, although fallible, might not discover sufficient evidence to ground a valid objective certainty (absolute certainty or reasonable moral certainty as the case may be) that e.g. '2+2=4', or 'The theory of relativity is true', or 'God has promised to protect from error a whole class of statements made by the pope in certain fairly well-defined circumstances'. One would need to examine the purported evidence in each case, but there is no reason in principle that it could not exist, despite our fallibility.      Justin (the 'Unknown' above)  "

So the view would be that there are moral norms of combination and overall norms of combination, both of which take into account exactly the same first order considerations, but sometimes come to different conclusions because they weigh the very same first order considerations differently (e.g., in the case where a moderate amount of _F_ -considerations needs to be sacrificed for a moderate amount of good for one’s children)."

Both jars also contain an equal number of yellow beans. Someone takes a handful of beans from one of the jars. We don’t know which. We have several red beans, a few blue beans, and a few yellow beans. So the evidence in this case is _compatible_ with the beans coming from either jar, but it’s surprising on the assumption that they came out of the second jar and unsurprising on the assumption that they came out of the first.

4110,sceptic,theist,"Consensus? That’s your justification for calling 5000 years of recorded history a lie? The better question is, “Were you there?” If not, you have less historical documentation from which to make your assumptions about Christ’s life than the average local minister. You have absolutely nothing to prove you are correct other than the writings of modern day cynics, unbelievers, skeptics and other assorted disgruntled humans. This is hardly the kind of “proof” that any reasonable person could use and still come to your conclusions. And certainly their writings are nothing of value to anyone who is seriously seeking the truth because most begin with personal assumptions based on their own “feelings” versus the eyewitness accounts of the 12 men who lived with Jesus, 11 of whom were viciously martyred, rather than deny their faith in Christ as the Son of God.

With no _deus ex machina_ to rescue us, the issue stands before us, waiting to be resolved by humanity, perhaps by way of adhering to principles similar to the Eightfold Path of Buddhism. What is notable about the Buddhist solution to the problem is that it makes it _our_ problem and makes us responsible for doing something about the evil and suffering in our world; it places the burden on us to lift the world out of degeneracy."
2284,sceptic,theist,"This is more or less the smoking gun. If we have either of these, but preferably both, we have no reason to doubt the authorship of the text. To go with an example you’re no doubt familiar with, no one can reasonably doubt the authorship of the authentic Pauline Epistles: 1 and 2 Corinthians , Galatians, Philemon, Philippians, Romans, and 1 Thessalonians. This can’t be reasonably doubted because Paul identifies himself within the text. Yet the ones that are doubted– Ephesians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians, Hebrews, 1 and 2 Timothy, and Titus–are doubted for one of the reasons cited above. The non-authentic Pauline Epistles are written in a palpably different style that doesn’t match the style of the authentic ones. That there are only seven authentic Pauline Epistles is a matter of scholarly consensus as well. Ephesians was and still is disputed, but it is likelier that Ephesians is not authentic."

Moreover, a consistent Humean will have to take a much more modest view of natural science than contemporary atheists are wont to do – in part because of Hume’s attack on attempts to justify induction, and in part because the deliverances of modern physics are hardly less abstruse and remote from common life than the rationalist speculations he was so keen to shoot down. A Humean must also give up a rationalistic ethics, given that, as he famously holds, there is nothing contrary to _reason_ (but only to the sentiments of the average person) to prefer that the entire world be destroyed than that one should suffer a scratch to his finger. Humean arguments entail a pessimism about the powers of human reason that doesn’t sit well with scientism or with dogmatic and triumphalist versions of atheism (even if many atheists and adherents of scientism naively suppose otherwise)."

They do not think, so their thinking cannot be confused.      Humans tricked into believing false things are tricked through their intellects. Human behavior is controlled, one way or another, by what we arrive at through thinking and what we think can be confused and incorrect, especially when others are trying to confuse for their own purposes. A person given a false argument that convinces him that he can drive up a ramp at a certain speed and leap his car over a big rock might try it and consequently hurt himself based on the false idea that the argument was correct, and this would be a mistake or confusion of his intellect, not of his feelings.      Animals kill each other too so I guess that means it is OK to kill another person if our feelings are all that it takes to justify action.      What a funny way to express yourself!

865,theist,sceptic,"@ Vincent Torley,      Particles that are bound are in a different state than ""free floating"" particles. In a living body the state of these particles is a complicated superposition of orthoganal functions of position and time. The eigenfunctions of their states are similarly local and complicated since potentials themselves vary in a complicated way inside a living body, and they certainly change when the body no longer functions, as in death, when neurons, muscle cells, etc., are no longer transmitting and conducting action potentials. Whether a physicist does or does not believe that there is such a thing as death, i.e. whether or not anything changes is not relevant to the truth ( it is absurd to think that nothing changes). Hylemorphism is not inconsistent with radical state change of the wave function of the entire body with death.      Furthermore, the study of brain states with various types of probes disturbs the states and causes them to be different than they would be while private, according to quantum mechanics, so attempting to understand a free mind by probing brain states is bound to be beset with difficulties.

4397,theist,sceptic," _Insofar as metaphysics and religion both deal with matters that are not strictly evidentiary._      I can't say I agree with this hypothesis.      The sciences (all sciences, including the most firm and certain) all rely on _principles_ that they use in drawing conclusions. For instance, they all rely on principles of logic. You can't assert conclusions from experiments without using the principles of logic.      Philosophy provides some of those principles. Indeed, ""Philosophy of science"" is (or ought to be) considered a discipline that is foundational to the sciences. (And the discipline of logic is, itself, foundational to the philosophy of science, so it too is foundational to science.) The fact that _scientists_ often may be ignorant of the issues that trouble the prior disciplines doesn't mean that they are not USING the results of those disciplines, just as they might not bother to expend huge efforts on studying symbolic logic when they use principles of logic.      And the notion that the discipline of the philosophy of science is ""not evidentiary"" and therefore something lesser than ""science"" is just a non- starter: like the discipline of logic, science simply cannot function without the results handed to it by sound philosophy of science, and its **use of evidence** relies on sound philosophy of science. If one wishes to take all of philosophy as diminished in standing because it is ""non-evidentiary"", then one diminishes science itself.      Metaphysics, like logic, provides some of the underpinnings upon which the philosophy of science operates. You cannot have a sound philosophy of science with an unsound metaphysics in the background.      _Are religion and philosophy neighbors on the plane? It would seem so. They certainly are in university humanities departments, had you not noticed. And so, is religion philosophy? There is evidence of this. Belief, after Davidson, is a propositional attitude, and both religion and philosophy are propositional._      The fact that universities place ""religion"" and ""philosophy"" in the same boat is evidence, rather, that universities are operating on a BAD set of underlying positions regarding thought, knowledge, etc. For example, they treat propositions that _can't be proven_ and are held to be in contention to constitute ""matters for 'belief' rather than matters for 'knowledge"". But a proper understanding of metaphysics and knowledge allows for truths that can be known _without proof_ , i.e. first principles that can be known DIRECTLY rather than via a proof: self-evident principles. The rejection of this category by moderns is a _methodological_ mistake that causes the mistaken _assumption_ that ""philosophy"" is not about things that can be known, but only believed.      It would be just as coherent to say ""science is propositional, and rests on the _belief_ that we can rely on experimental evidence, therefore it is a belief system.""  "

44,theist,sceptic,"I am not sure I buy (1). But it sounds kind of right to me now. Additionally, (3) kind of sounds correct on its own. If _A_ causes _B_ and _B_ causes _C_ but there is no explanation of _A_ , then it seems that _B_ and _C_ are really unexplained. Aristotle notes that there was a presocratic philosopher who explained why the earth doesn’t fall down by saying that it floats on water, and he notes that the philosopher failed to ask the same question about the water. I think one lesson of Aristotle’s critique is that if it is unexplained why the water doesn’t fall down it is unexplained why the earth falls down."

2977,theist,sceptic,"I'm ""self-banned"" from commenting on Feser's blog. I wanted to see what Thomists (or those friendly to or knowledgeable about it) think about the following objection to Thomism and divine simplicity: So I would say I am 99% sure that foreknowledge is incompatible with libertarian free will (the categorical ability to do otherwise in a non-random way). Now, if ""Mullins reply to Feser on 8/26"" is true right now, then Mullins can't do otherwise without falsifying the truth value of the sentence. To be free, ""Mullins reply..."" would have to false (or neither true nor false), then becomes true if and when Mullins replies to Feser on 8/26. Since it becomes true, it seems to me there is a change and/or succession in God's intellect (in God, therefore). This suggests to me that even if I (a layman, mind you) can't pinpoint exactly what goes wrong in Thomist arguments, there must be something wrong at the root of it. If I'm right, the true debate is between open theism and atheism. That is, unless the Thomist wants to reject libertarian free will and say we are all puppets of Pure Act."

5345,sceptic,theist,"Since the Bible is the genesis of all knowledge of God, I have made it my mission to read every single word. I am fascinated by Christians who believe it is infallible. It is perfectly written, without fault, lies, or falsehoods, and it contains the very words of God. I wonder about those who profess this belief while having failed to read every word God has written. I will spare everyone the beginning because you are all familiar enough with the story of Adam and Eve. I will just pause to wonder why God would set Adam up for failure. If he did not want Adam to eat from the tree, then why was the tree in the Garden? Perhaps God wanted him to eat from the tree? Well then, why punish him and Eve for doing so? And why would he allow that wily serpent to be in their midst? Surely, God, being omniscient, had to have known that Eve would be powerless to resist the serpent’s deception. And if he saw Adam failing and the cascade of consequences that would follow, why not scrap this plan and start from a reality in where Adam succeeds in obeying him? This is the first, original sin and the reason why I am wretched, the Christian preaches. This just is not fair because who is to say that I would have failed where Adam did. Or you, for that matter! If any one of us would have failed in Adam’s stead, then we were already flawed to begin with. A perfect god created an imperfect man…on purpose."

4894,theist,sceptic,"(Continuation)      It's important to note though that ""Dharmas are just tropes"" and for them ""The ultimate ontology consists entirely of tropes. But these, together with the facts about human interests and cognitive limitations, explain the more familiar world populated by persisting composite substances with their various properties. Among the substances in this more familiar world are things that we also call water atoms. But these, it turns out, are a many masquerading as a one"" (pp. 60). And if it was any doubt left between humean bundle theory and buddhist position I think this will suffice.      Siderits then brings up this purported answer to the problem of ""smuggling substance back in"": ""One might wonder whether the Buddhist reductionist is entitled to bring facts about human persons into their explanation, given that humans are themselves substances. But these substances are, they will reply, reducible to systems consisting of bundles of tropes behaving in accordance with causal laws. Among the behaviors explained by the relevant causal laws are the use of convenient designators by such systems. So the reductive explanation of the intuitions behind the posit of substances does not illegitimately smuggle substances into the explanans.""      And this brings yet another problem with them: the handwaving appeal to ""sciences"". It's not hard to find these guys arguing that there are ""stone- wise arranged atoms"" or that natural selection somehow vindicates the idea of impermanence (Garfield appeals a lot more for these kinds of things, that's why I'm not using his work that much). But that does not seem right, because that turns your metaphysics hostage to the scientific findings - the same findings that may overthrow your own view.      But if we come to focus on other points like their appeal to nominalism, they suffer from the same problems that Ed emphasized in TLS and Scholastics meta. The points like how they can even communicate with themselves if there are no universals - or even worse if there are just ""momentary beings"". But I think that their denial of universals has some relation with their momentariness thesis. And that's what I can't even understand in the first place. How can someone think that something analogous to the Heraclitean position is right in the first place? It's illogical. And someone might even say that, correctly, that the ""buddhist logic"" is very different from ""Aristotelian logic"". Fair enough. But that doesn't explain why someone might think that something so absurd as ""impermanent beings"" (let alone mereological nihilism, nominalism) is plausible in the first place. To affirm that ""there are no pots that last longer than a moment"" and that ""there is just a series of ephemeral pots one after another"" is not to disprove permanence, but to evade the problem altogether.      (I will continue)"
5331,sceptic,theist,"b) It begs the question because it really is no different from someone saying “just wait and see!” Many people on all sides died waiting and seeing and per Schellenberg, honestly sought divinity their entire lives and came up empty. If God had a better track record of making do on past atrocities, then we would be able to inductively reason, as many of us do with science, in this manner. The thing is, it looks like the bills for the Holocaust and slavery are overdue and all of us, living ~80 and ~450 years respectively, after these atrocities happened, cannot even begin to causally connect potential goods that God has deployed with the intention of paying this debt. Perhaps it is too much to expect God to pay that debt because those were human crimes; but I can also think of disasters, diseases, pandemics, mass extinctions, and other natural evils that are overdue and again, I am not sure what goods are intended to repay the extinctions of all of our hominid cousins, for example."
1175,sceptic,theist,"Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God? Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some, suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?"

3754,sceptic,theist,"[12] The ‘causation’ in question, moreover, can be variously understood. We might, for instance, follow D. H. Mellor’s discussion of the causation of stasis in Mellor (1998, ch. 9). Mellor distinguishes between _factual_ and _particular_ causation, arguing that something’s remaining unchanged between times _t_ and _t’_ is merely an instance of factual causation. See also Saudek (2020, p. 92) on this point."
2897,sceptic,theist,"The same goes for omniscience. What if there’s a being that knows all things except one thing; let’s suppose this being doesn’t know how to play billiards. What is the difference between an omniscient being who knows all things and another being who knows all things save the required know-how to play billiards? Again, as there are different infinities, there are different levels of omniscience and we simply wouldn’t be able to distinguish between a being who knows everything and one who knows everything except for how to play billiards."
5159,sceptic,theist,"The basic idea is this. Consider a collection of particles of type _P_ which constitute water at time _t_. Though they actually constitute water at _t_ , there is nothing in the particles _qua particles of type P_ that suffices to make them water rather than one of the other alternatives mentioned. Again, _qua particles of type P_ they have the potential to constitute water, or separate quantities of hydrogen and oxygen, or some other substance or aggregate of substances. So, there must at _t_ be something distinct from the collection which actualizes its potential to be _water_ , specifically."
1907,sceptic,theist,"With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it commits the fallacy of undistributed middle.

718,sceptic,theist,"Wilson makes another good point about “ethically relevant features” of a situation: “Faced with people who don’t ‘get’ a thought experiment, the temptation for philosophers is to say that these people aren’t sufficiently good at isolating what is ethically relevant. Obviously, such a response risks being self-serving, and tends to gloss over an important question: how should we determine what are the ethically relevant features of a situation? Why, for example, should a philosopher sitting in an armchair be in a better position to determine the ethically relevant features of ‘The Violinist’ than someone who’s worked with thousands of patients?”"
1647,sceptic,theist,"In my previous publications I have explained that the classical doctrine of divine simplicity says all that is in God _is_ God. These identity claims leave no room for any distinctions in God. Anselm is clear on this point. He says that, “whatever is made up of parts is not absolutely one, but in a sense many and other than itself, and it can be broken up either actually or _by the mind_ —all of which things are foreign to” God.[19] Compare a similar statement made by Jacob Arminius in his _25 Public Disputations_ , Disputation IV.XI: “Simplicity is a pre-eminent mode of the Essence of God, by which he is void of all composition, and of component parts whether they belong to the senses or to the understanding.”[20] What this means is that not even conceptual distinctions can apply to the simple God. As Anselm explains, “what either actually or conceptually has parts can be divided into parts, and this is altogether foreign to God.” ( _Incarnation of the Word_ VII). Avicenna concurs that even conceptual distinctions are foreign to the simple God.[21]"

2732,theist,sceptic,"I also read of a possible donation being ""temporary"": apparently, Jane giving her uterus to Sally for Sally to bear a child, and then Jane getting her uterus back later. While this level of medical interventionism seems (to me) rather appallingly blythe about risks, it also (seemingly) would greatly reduce the weight of the argument about Jane ""maiming"" herself: it's not permanent. She gets her faculty back, intact.      Maybe this is all not reasonably ""worth"" the financial costs to the system of two such heavily invasive procedures with ongoing risks (e.g. immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection), but that's also probably not a hill to die on: if Sally has the money for whatever reason, spending it to produce a child ""by natural means"" (so to speak) is not, _per se_ , a wrongful use of wealth. And (of course) the cost will come down if the practice gets more common.      However, if any of the process also involves _in vitro fertilization_ , that's immoral and would vitiate the entire plan of the medical process. IVF as currently practiced involves at least 2 intrinsically evil acts, so that it is inherently wrong, and any larger process that requires this (or presumes it) would be wrong also. (My comments above were premised on the idea that conception could happen normally.)"

1297,sceptic,theist,"While the first statement is at least defensible, the latter is a joke. There’s an obvious asymmetry here, because saving innocent people is more important than killing guilty people. The staunchest defender of capital punishment wouldn’t appeal to a few worthy recipients if they were the _exception_. Unless the vast majority are guilty, even they would lose their stomach for supporting the policy in practice. So, we already agree that preserving innocent life is _far_ more important than justifiably killing the few who deserve it. Yet, they have a much higher tolerance for killing innocent people than we do."

Even if our consciousness does somehow exert downward causation (which it obviously does, IMHO), all of our “choices” are either completely locked-in at the moment of the Big Bang (or even “before” that), or effectively locked-in at human scales with a bit of quantum randomness in the mix, neither of which gives us anything more than just a *feeling* of having made a free choice."

The answer is in the Bible. Edom means ""red"" and it was the first ""red state"" in recorded history.

If the theory is true, the cosmos is a heck of lot more complicated and fun than we have previously imagined. But does a multiverse help Oord? Perhaps. It gives us a way to think of universes having beginnings and endings, each being formed from a previous one—and all this happening under the creative agency of the Deity. We may wonder, though, why it’s even necessary to invoke a Creator for the universe-formation process. Science needs neither a jump-starting Demiurge nor a supernatural being to account for the beginnings and endings of the various universes within the multiverse. But more importantly, the multiverse as a cosmic whole remains unexplained. It is still possible to ask, “Why the multiverse, rather than nothing?” Oord’s apparent answer—it’s [turtles](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2014/01/29/is-god-a-turtle/) all the way down!"
3501,theist,sceptic,"I'd disagree with the analogy to leaves on the ground though; design arguments are more like finding a bunch of leaves organised in a perfect triangle, which obviously can't be caused by non-intelligent causes, but either by animals or humans.      And so arguments from design get us closer to God insofar as they purport to show evidence which points to an intelligent cause, and one that's above us as well. Which COULD still be explained by agents other than God, but at least that narrows things down a lot - they have to be intelligent and powerful agents.      Furthermore, it gives credibility to accounts which say God is the one who created life on Earth directly, which is a pre-existing claim which can be supported somewhat, in a real way, with design arguments, even though not strictly proved by them."

4541,sceptic,theist,"To see this, let us dig into an example Backmann uses: “My power to bake a cake would not bring a cake that did not exist _simpliciter_ before into existence, but only make a cake that eternally exists _simpliciter_ present. Every activity reduces to a change in what is present” (Ibid.). The Neo- Aristotelian is off track to say we have _power_ to bake a cake and that the oven has _power_ to yield this desired outcome that do not trace back to its parts or as Cartwright states of general nomological machines: “We explicate how the machine arrangement dictates what can happen – it has emergent powers which are not to be found in its components” (Cartwright, Nancy & Pemberton, John (2013). Aristotelian powers: without them, what would modern science do? In John Greco & Ruth Groff (eds.), _Powers and Capacities in Philosophy: the New Aristotelianism_. London, U.K.: Routledge. pp. 93-112.). Of the nomological machines in nature, Cartwright appears to bypass the role of evolution. Of such machines invented by humans, she ignores the fact that we often wrongly predict what a given invention will do. Evolution proceeds via probabilities and so, from our _ad hoc_ point of view, it looks very much like trial and error. Humans have the advantage of being much more deliberate about what they are _selecting_ for and therefore, our testing and re-testing of inventions and deciding when they are safe and suitable to hit the market is markedly similar to evolutionary selection."

It is instead going to involve metaphysical reasoning that begins with much deeper facts about the world – for example, the fact that the things that make it up are compounds of essence and existence or of actuality and potentiality – and arguing that nothing that is like that could exist even for an instant without a sustaining cause that is not composite in such ways. (Longtime readers will understand what I am talking about, but for the uninitiated, these are examples of concepts appealed to in Thomistic and Aristotelian arguments for God’s existence, which [I have expounded and defended at length elsewhere](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Proofs-Existence-Edward- Feser/dp/1621641333/ref=pd_sim_14_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=JBGA9F0R86NCQBXMT2ZJ).)"
4476,sceptic,theist,"That leaves open the question as to why people on the right see these positions as fundamentally opposed to their brand of politics. Again, if your political party imposes these discriminatory and even racist views on you, it is good sign that you should renounce it. There are ways to be fiscally conservative, a proponent of small government, and so on without subscribing to views that promote racial, gender, and wealth inequality. I fail to see how what I have had outlined is unclear or nonsensical. The isms, once unpacked, should not be as controversial. This is why I prefer stating my positions clearly, so that there is no room for misconstruing, misrepresenting, straw manning, and so on. There is, in my book, a difference between an opponent and an enemy. The enmity I reserve for my enemies has everything to do with the fact that they think their ignorance is better than my knowledge, their apathy superior to my empathy, their desire to oppress groups they dislike equal to my desire for equality. Opponents, by contrast, can have their minds changed. The omission of relevant facts is not the same as ignorance. My enemies intend to ignore that which disagrees with or defeats their views and more importantly, they intend to cause harm to people like myself, so they do so by weaponizing their right to vote to further marginalized groups they want to harm. Then they pretend to be innocent because they are not drawing a firearm. They might as well. Voting for a candidate that does not care about the plights of minorities, women, non-Christians, etc. is a deliberate attempt to harm these groups. You are not innocent."

4698,theist,sceptic," _But I put it to you that traditional, cosmological arguments have a problem of their own: all they establish is the existence of an Ultimate Cause, or Necessary Being, which may or may not be personal - i.e. an intelligent moral agent.      Defenders of the traditional arguments typically attempt to rectify this deficiency by arguing that (i) the Ultimate Cause or Necessary Being must be Pure Being itself,..._      Interestingly, St. Thomas gives _five separate proofs_ for the existence of God, the fifth of which hinges _explicitly_ on intelligent action, requiring an intelligent agent. While this is concededly not the cosmological argument, there is no reason why the same person cannot argue the cosmological argument AND the _order of the universe_ argument to assert that the root ""cause of being"" and the root ""cause of order"" is an intelligent God.      Sure, you could ask why those have to arrive at the _very same_ God, but there's no reason to _assume_ this is particularly difficult to address.      _Nor does God's intelligence follow from his being the Ultimate Cause, for the cause of X need not possess any knowledge of X._      But you cannot go the other way: it is impossible for the root cause of the order being different from the cause of being of everything (but itself), because if the cause of being is not intelligent, it cannot be the source of the intelligence that is the source of order in the universe, and it is impossible that the cause of _being_ of the universe act _independently_ of the cause of the order and still be the **root** cause of being of an ordered universe."

3493,theist,sceptic,"The failing here is in both the intellect and the will. It is in the intellect insofar as this way of dealing with others typically involves the committing of several logical fallacies. For example, there is the _circumstantial ad hominem_ fallacy of pretending to refute what someone says by claiming to identify some suspect motive on his part.  There is the fallacy of _poisoning the well_ , which involves casting aspersions on another’s character rather than addressing his claims or arguments. There is _guilt by association_ , in which one attributes view X to a person who believes Y simply because other people who believe Y have been associated with X. There is the _abusive ad hominem_ , which involves simply flinging a pejorative label at a person (“racist,” “fascist,” “communist,” etc.) as if this sufficed to rebut his claim or argument. And there is what seems to compete with the circumstantial _ad hominem_ for the status of most popular fallacy on social media – the _tu quoque_ , which involves accusing someone of hypocrisy and supposing that one has thereby refuted his claim or argument."

This is about the expectations that Christians have _of themselves_ – _given_ their beliefs – and whether those expectations are panning out."

On the metaphysical plane, spelling intentional, I suppose religion takes a seat. Insofar as metaphysics and religion both deal with matters that are not strictly evidentiary. Are religion and philosophy neighbors on the plane? It would seem so. They certainly are in university humanities departments, had you not noticed. And so, is religion philosophy?

1293,theist,sceptic,"@ Victor Torley,      We are speaking at opposed purposes, not cross-purposes.      :-)      ""the intrinsic properties of elementary particles (such as quarks and electrons) [...] do not change when particles are bound in a structure""      In quantum mechanics the properties and existence of a particle is known only through observed interactions with other particles and these interactions are certainly different when the particle is bound then it is when it is free, so it is merely semantics whether you call it the same particle or a different particle that is found by probing. It definitely has different properties. ""Intrinsic properties"" are properties with reference to ""self"" and are not directly accessible but are inferred by extrinsic measurement, which changes, as I said, when the probe is into a bound system versus into relatively free particles. A free particle is _potentially_ a bound particle if it can be taken up into the bound system (see that word root ""potential"" there and think of Aquinas when you do).      Another difficulty with your view is explaining how unique particles, like red blood cells (they are not identical), to which quantum mechanics also must apply, could be probed experimentally at all for fit with the laws of quantum mechanics. Red blood cells also exist in superpositions of states, but since each RBC is unique, there is no way to test its interactions for interference.      I spoke of a golf ball being in a different state after being knocked from a tee. Note that the state, when it is flying, is one which it is only potentially in before it is hit. It certainly has different properties which it only potentially had before being sent flying. Get in the way of the flying ball. It hurts, but the ball sitting on the tee doesn't.      Your propositional distributive law is not about intrinsic properties either. Particles behave. They do not do logic calculations with propositions. Your propositional distributive law is something that exists in our minds, not in particles. It is not relevant to Aristotelian action and potential, which fits very well with, i.e. does not contradict, quantum mechanics.      Your argument simply fails to show otherwise.      :-)      Tom Cohoe  "
5541,theist,sceptic,"@Aron 1) Wow, you just buried yourself with your own arguments. If we can't even be sure we ourselves exist, and all knowledge / perception / thinking could just be false or irrational or even non-existent, then golly there can't be such a thing as justification either.      Certainly not individual but even less universal - other people could just not exist as well, or be illusions, or whatever. Even if other people existed, universal consensus or being convinced somethign is justified could also just as well be false or non-existent.      You should thereby become an absolute skeptic of everything.         2) As for self-awareness depending on memory...every single memory you have right now could just be false...but you'd still be aware you have those memories. All your beliefs could be false & illusory, yet you'd still have those beliefs.      So unless the Principle of Non-contradiction is false...we can be absolutely sure we have the memories / beliefs / experiences we actually have.      You either have memories / beliefs / thoughts / experiences or you don't.     "

Even granting that experimental knowledge is required for omniscience, I don't think this follows. If I have ridden a bike in the past, but then am injured so that I can't ride any more, it doesn't seem like I would lose the knowledge of riding just because I lost the capacity.

4746,theist,sceptic,"Where the study of consciousness is concerned, recent philosophy of mind has followed David Chalmers in distinguishing between “easy problems” and the “hard problem.” Identifying the neural correlates of various kinds of conscious awareness would be examples of an easy problem. By characterizing such a problem as “easy,” Chalmers doesn’t mean that it is trivial, or even easy in every respect. He just means that it is the sort of problem the solution to which seems clearly attainable using existing methods and standard scientific and philosophical assumptions. The “hard problem” is explaining why any of the neural processes in question are associated with conscious awareness, given that it seems at least prima facie possible that they could do what neuroscience describes them as doing in the complete absence of consciousness. (This is alleged to be shown by arguments like Chalmers’ [“zombie argument,”](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2013/12/zombies- shoppers-guide.html) along with other influential arguments like Frank Jackson’s [“knowledge argument”](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2010/07/when-frank-jilted- mary.html) and [Thomas Nagel’s argument](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2012/04/reading-rosenberg- part-x.html) in his famous article “What is it Like to Be a Bat?”)"

They tried to give, to the best they could, a reason to _deny_ the idea of Limbo by laying out ""the case"" for such children being saved and going to heaven. Unfortunately for their effort, (so far as I can see), the entire argument they give, in order to defeat the position of there being a Limbo (of some sort) would be _**equally**_ an argument that ALL men must go to heaven, regardless how many sins in they are guilty of a few moments before death.

For instance, if each child of God spared a grisly death at the hands of an abortionist meant $10,000 less in overall welfare spending, would that constitute a deal with the devil?      Or how about if it were only $500? Is $500 in welfare spending worth more than one innocent and helpless human life?

In fact, just from memory, Plato, Avicenna, Aquinas and Leibniz all argued for the first cause having a intellect with arguments diferent from the cited. Notice that this saves the cosmological arguments from the kantian objection that Ed cited, for these thinkers used exactly the premisses of the stage 1 of the cosmological arguments to argue for the first cause personhood. I don't think the user of the design argument can go to stage 2 soo easily.      Also, at least Ed defended a argument like you cited while trying to show exactly why the first cause containing of the forms need to be in a way similar to a intellect, so it is unfair to say that the argument does not do its goal.
