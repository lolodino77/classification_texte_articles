Let _E_ be a positive test result.

For making the priors be that makes (c) easier to definitely satisfy while keeping (b) definitely satisfied. Since there are no false negatives, the posterior for _p_ will be:"

5203,sceptic,theist,"15 Now some persons belonging to the seven [Jewish] sects existing among the people, which have been before described by me in the Commentaries, asked James: “What is the door of Jesus? And he replied that he was the Savior. In consequence of this answer, some believed that Jesus is the Christ. But the sects before mentioned did not believe, either in a resurrection or in the coming of one to requite every man according to his works; but those who did believe, believed because of James. So, when many even of the ruling class believed, there was a commotion among the Jews, and scribes, and Pharisees, who said, “A little more, and we shall have all the people looking for Jesus as the Christ.”"

2607,theist,sceptic,"Now, someone might also object that an argument need not get you _all_ the way to God to get you _part_ of the way. And that is perfectly true. Suppose, for example, that some version of the argument from contingency (such as those defended by Avicenna, Aquinas, and Leibniz) really does demonstrate the existence of an absolutely necessary being. That would certainly do much to establish classical theism, even if one did not go on to show that this necessary being had further divine attributes such as omnipotence and omniscience. For necessity itself is one of the divine attributes, which radically differentiates God from everything else, so that to establish that something exists of necessity is a crucial step on the way to a complete argument for theism."

1406,sceptic,theist,"When it’s said that “Love is just a chemical reaction,” or “Humans are just bags of chemicals,” it’s the “just” that I have a problem with. Love _is_ a chemical reaction—it is not _just_ a chemical reaction. Tunnel vision reductionists take one description of reality and declare it to be the _real_ description of reality to the exclusion of all others. At the very least, the given lower level of description is considered “more true” than higher-level descriptions. These reductionists arbitrarily eliminate every other description of the world except one, then act as if they’re the only ones with the courage to look the hard truth straight in the face. However, if we describe the biochemical correlates of love, we haven’t described everything there is to know about love, nor have we given the “real” description of love. We’ve provided _a_ description (one that’s often useful), but there are many legitimate ways of talking about our world – scientific and non-scientific. Even strictly in the realm of scientific inquiry, it doesn’t make sense to choose one way of talking about reality to the exclusion of all others."

Perhaps in the case where the moral considerations are at too low a level to override the _N_ -prohibition, we can still have _moral_ permission to _ϕ_ , but that permission no longer overrides the _N_ -prohibition. On this story, there are two kinds of cases, in both of which we have moral permission, but in one case the moral permission comes along with sufficiently strong moral considerations to override the _N_ -prohibition, while in the other it does not. On this story, moral requirement always overrides non-moral reasons; but whether moral considerations override non-moral considerations depends on the relative strengths of the two sets of considerations."
2224,theist,sceptic,"Not even then—in the era of the Egyptian wickedness, I mean—was it opportune for the Corrector of all things to associate with our life. No, for it was necessary for the iniquity of the Israelites to be exposed. It was still necessary for both the kingdom of the Assyrians and the smouldering arrogance of Nabucodonosor to be made manifest in human life. It was necessary for the foul murder of the righteous ones to spring up like some wicked and thorny plant from the Devil’s evil root. It was necessary for the raging fury of the Jews against the Saints of God to be revealed: they slew the Prophets and stoned those sent by God, and finally perpetrated the murder of Zacharias between the Temple and the altar. Add to this list of enormities the slaughter of the children by Herod. When, therefore, the full force of evil had emerged from its wicked root and had proliferated, running riot in a variety of ways in the behavior of those in every generation notorious for their depravity, it was then, as Paul says to the Athenians, that God, overlooking the times of ignorance, came in the latter days, when there was no one who understood Him or sought after Him, when all had gone astray and had alike become good for nothing, when all things had been enveloped in sin; when iniquity had multiplied, and when the darkness of evil had increased to the highest degree. Then did Grace appear, then did the radiance of the true Light dawn. Then did the Sun of righteousness appear to those sitting in darkness and the shadow of death; then did He crush the many heads of the dragon, stepping on him with His foot, through His human flesh, dashing him to the earth and trampling on him.

As I have argued at length elsewhere (including in _Aristotle’s Revenge_ ), much of what is today assumed to be “scientific” – the refusal to countenance irreducibly teleological explanations, the primary/secondary quality distinction, and so on – are really just contentious philosophical assumptions masquerading as empirical results. And it is not possible to do science without making philosophical assumptions of some kind, which are bound to be controversial."
5625,theist,sceptic,"""Suppose, for example, that someone said that he was contemplating Aquinas’s First Way or... I personally think both those arguments happen to be successful demonstrations of God’s existence.""      The First Way attempts to use scientifically testable observations as a basis for logical arguments for the existence of god.      The First Way is an argument from motion, which is offered in the general sense of change of heat in the example of heat-fire-wood. Motion is also used in its more common literal sense, as positional translation through space, in the example of hand-staff.      Thus, if one is using the First Way as an argument for the existence of god then the assertion of the existence of god is indeed a scientific hypothesis in that the examples of the First Way are scientifically falsifiable.      Science has already falsified the argument from motion, therefor the god hypothesis has been scientifically falsified, to the extent it depends upon the First Way, which has already been falsified.      The statement ""the staff moves only because it is put in motion by the hand"" is clearly false, as the staff will move ad infinitum (as Aristotle posited for motion in the void) absent an impeding medium. The fundamental error of Aristotle, Aquinas, Feser, and the majority of posters here is in failing to realize that space, for motion, is the functional equivalent of the void, and everything is in space, including the hand and the staff.      The false statement by Aquinas that ""the staff moves only because it is put in motion by the hand"" is based on the false notion that absent a continuous mover the staff will slow, and stop, and its motion will be lost, therefore, it was incorrectly thought, a mover is required to keep it moving.      In truth, all objects in the universe are part of a system of perpetual motion such that motion is never lost, only transferred and mutually perpetuated in some form.      ""arguing that nothing that is like that could exist even for an instant without a sustaining cause""   Feser has this back to front in a very strange inversion of logic.      If material exists at time1 and continues to exist at time2 that is no change in the existence of that material, therefore no changer is called for to account for no change.      If material exists at time1 and ceases to exist at time2 that is a change in the existence of that material, therefore a changer is called for to account for the change in the existence of that material.      Sustained existence = no change, therefore, no changer.   Unsustained existence = change, therefore, a changer.      Pretty simple. How Feser and all the good posters here can be confused on such an obvious point is a puzzlement indeed."

3473,theist,sceptic,"Bradley      I agree with Tomaszewki that you get the same modal collapse if God is non- simple.   The simplicity of God just makes this more obvious.   What I don't agree with is his ""solution"".   Here is why   ""Z1. God’s idea of zebras caused zebras to exist.   Z2. God’s idea of unicorns caused zebras to exist.   Here, (Z1) is true while (Z2) is obviously false, even though God’s idea of zebras is necessarily really identical to God’s idea of unicorns (and to the Divine essence)"".   The problem with this is the claim that God's 'distinct' ideas are logically posterior to God's cognition of Himself.   If God's idea of zebras is really identical to God's idea of unicorns there is no reason at all why the idea of a zebra would not cause a unicorn (or anything else). In order forGod to cause a zebra instead of a unicorn, God has to 'think' they are different. But a simple being's thought of a unicorn is identical to the thought of a zebra because there is no reason why a thought would differ from an idea.      The reason why thinking I saw Jack the Ripper caused me to run away does not entail that thinking Fracis Tumblety caused me to run away is because 'Jack the Ripper' and 'Francis Tumblety' are really distinct ideas for me. If I knew for certain that Francis and Jack were the same then thinking I saw Jack _would_ entail Z1.   Likewise, _thinking_ that zebras are not unicorns entails that the idea of a zebra cannot be identical to the idea of a unicorn.   Even if God's thinking or his ideas are logically posterior to God's cognition of Himself, those thought or ideas are still intrinsic to God and hence cannot differ across worlds.   Add to this that a simple being cannot have distinct thoughts and it becomes obvious that Tomaszewki's solution fails."

But if both A and B are actual, then the same proposition will be both true and false. It won't help to say, it's true in world A and false in another world, B, since you're positing that both subworlds are actual and you seem to agree that the Urworld - your multiverse - is all that is the case."

4760,theist,sceptic,"@Vicent      It is true that the philosopher can't stablish a first cause and them say it is God while never showing that it is inteligent, but that seems largely a trivial observation, for people working on cosmological arguments today call what you are talking about stage 2 of the cosmological argument(stage 1 is showing there is a cause) and several older thinkers, while not using the stage distinction, argued for it.      In fact, just from memory, Plato, Avicenna, Aquinas and Leibniz all argued for the first cause having a intellect with arguments diferent from the cited. Notice that this saves the cosmological arguments from the kantian objection that Ed cited, for these thinkers used exactly the premisses of the stage 1 of the cosmological arguments to argue for the first cause personhood. I don't think the user of the design argument can go to stage 2 soo easily.      Also, at least Ed defended a argument like you cited while trying to show exactly why the first cause containing of the forms need to be in a way similar to a intellect, so it is unfair to say that the argument does not do its goal.

2602,theist,sceptic,"Tomaszewski is a good writer, and he makes some good points in his paper. However, I think he unjustifiably dismisses hypothetical necessity, and that appears to undermine his possible worlds argument.      God is certainly identical with His acts, and in willing His goodness, He wills the world. Given that, said act of creating is necessary, but that doesn’t make creation absolutely necessary because the absolute necessity of God’s creative act is a condition upon which creation’s necessity _depends_. Thus, the ground for the universe’s necessity is extrinsic to the universe which makes it a conditional necessity.      Critics like Mullins argue that this undermines divine simplicity (DS) because it asserts two modalities (the act of willing and the act of creating), but there is no contradiction between the absolute necessity of God’s will and the conditional necessity God’s will produces. It’s a difference of cause and effect. Something absolutely necessary is necessary by its very concept whereas hypothetical necessity has an extrinsic ground. It is simply incorrect to assert the absolute necessity of the latter due to the absolute necessity of the former."

3557,theist,sceptic,"@Anonymous, Schmid’s first paper is actually an explication of Mullins’ critique of simplicity via God’s inability to create without a reason. Mullins appears to think authoritatively on the workings of the divine mind. But, he knows or should know that the very term _rational_ is an extremely limited label to describe something analogous to God. Schmid explains:       _God’s act of will is based on that self-same intrinsic goodness that is identical to God. This seems to be a far cry from a reason for creating, let alone a reason for creating this particular universe (as opposed to some other possible universe)._      This just strikes me as odd. Schmid and Mullins seem to argue that God’s reasoning in some way parallels ours, but we have not the slightest clue how the mind of God works. If the arguments for divine impassibility are successful, then God is impassible regardless our inability to figure out how simplicity can be maintained when we consider creation. If the DDI is false, then arguments should be provided to show the inferential mistakes therein.      Moreover, Mullins’ “proposals” are nothing but finite attempts at figuring out how creation is compatible with “reason.” And since Mullins cannot come up with a good reason for creation, DDI (the doctrine of divine impassibility) must be false. But this of course does not follow. It’s akin to arguments for the logical Problem of Evil. The fact that we cannot figure out a good reason for evil does not mean that one doesn’t exist. So long as it is logically possible that there is a morally justifiable reason for allowing evil, then evil cannot be used as evidence against God. And this also works the other way with transcendental arguments for God. The fact that God is the best explanation for rationality does not mean, in itself, that God exists. Spontaneous generation was at one the time the “best” explanation for the appearance of worms in rotting meat, but we discovered that it was neither best nor true. Thus, our apparent inability to come up with a reason for creation that is consistent with DDI does not mean that one doesn’t exist. Mullins should stick with attacking the arguments for DDI instead of engaging in vain attempts at understanding the divine mind.      I realize that this smacks of unprincipled mysterianism, but it’s just the opposite. An unsuccessful argument cannot be held together by an appeal to mystery. That would be unprincipled. But if an argument is sound, we cannot reasonably discard it based on our inability to figure out some of its consequences. For example, I believe the arguments for _creatio ex nihilo_ are convincing, but I don’t have a sweet clue how God did it. There are times when I find it an interesting mental exercise, but at the end of the road I’m always baffled. That doesn’t shake my confidence in the legitimacy of the argument; it just shows the limitation of my knowledge. Finite minds cannot comprehend an infinite mind, so it’s pointless to try. Likewise, I’m perfectly happy with the mystery of creation because the arguments for simplicity are solid.      I haven’t read the other paper, but I hope to as time permits."
418,theist,sceptic,"@Anonymous,      In addition to the above objections, Schmid’s extension of Mullins’ argument doesn’t work either. Schmid proposes the intuitive idea that reason itself makes one who utilizes it dependent, and if God has a reason for doing something, that makes God dependent in some fashion. But this of course reduces God’s internal reason to something less than or other than God, and that is something a classical theist, as I understand it, will not accept. God is reason and God is knowledge. He is the reason for creation, so if there is a “dependence,” then God is “dependent” upon Himself. This is hardly a defeater for either the DDI or the DDS."

If a cause does no explanatory work, then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St. Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example, that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy- basketball-trick).

I wonder about those who profess this belief while having failed to read every word God has written. I will spare everyone the beginning because you are all familiar enough with the story of Adam and Eve. I will just pause to wonder why God would set Adam up for failure. If he did not want Adam to eat from the tree, then why was the tree in the Garden? Perhaps God wanted him to eat from the tree? Well then, why punish him and Eve for doing so? And why would he allow that wily serpent to be in their midst? Surely, God, being omniscient, had to have known that Eve would be powerless to resist the serpent’s deception. And if he saw Adam failing and the cascade of consequences that would follow, why not scrap this plan and start from a reality in where Adam succeeds in obeying him? This is the first, original sin and the reason why I am wretched, the Christian preaches. This just is not fair because who is to say that I would have failed where Adam did. Or you, for that matter!

We imagine a “before” time and a “beyond” space, but of course both of those are incorrectly applying relative terms to the absolute. We do know that God started time and space, and is at times present at particular points within time and space, but applying the ‘block universe’ of General Relativity onto God is in no way reasonable, as He is the living beginning and end.      The fact that, at the most fundamental perspective, there is no space or time, is not really relevant to us (outside of mystical experience), or to Gods ongoing plan for our creation. We were created in time and space, and the plan is temporal and spatial. The trinity seems to be an important part of the way in which God acts in space and time, but essentially we only see and really conceive of this less fundamental ‘level’, within which God sometimes allows or makes His-eternal-self present.

4002,theist,sceptic,"Vincent,   Jaegwon Kim, a prominent physicalist working on the mind-body problem concedes that the default position of human societies is not physicalism but dualism: “Something like this dualism of personhood, I believe, is common lore shared across most cultures and religious traditions.” (Mind in a Physical World: An Essay on the Mind-Body Problem and Mental Causation; Cambridge: MIT Press, 2000). Charles Taliaferro lists Michael Levin, Daniel Dennett, David Lewis, Thomas Nagel, J. J. C. Smart, Richard Rorty, Donald Davidson, and Colin McGinn as other non-dualist scholars working in philosophy of mind who concede that some commonsense view of dualism is held by the overwhelming number of humankind now and throughout history. Children are dualists. As Henry Wellman puts it, the recent findings of developmental psychology show that ""young children are dualists: knowledgeable of mental states and entities as ontologically different from physical objects"" (The Child's Theory of Mind; Cambridge: MIT Press, 1990). The presumption follows that Ancient Israel, like other ancient societies, would have held this commonsense dualism unless one can find evidence otherwise. What the Christian who claims that the Hebrew Bible advocates physicalism over dualism needs are arguments in the Hebrew Bible countering the prevailing assumption by ancient peoples of a basic dualism. There are none. The Hellenization thesis, as applied to physicalism, is a complete dud. Instead, basic dualism is at least the operating principle of the Hebrew Bible. And as bad as the position of Nancey Murphey, Brian Rosner, Paul Althaus and other Christian physicalists is, at least they are not global physicalists, i.e. they acknowledge that God is not composed of waves and limited to the speed of light.   The Hellenization thesis is discredited with regards to doctrines like divine impassibility (Paul Gavrilyuk and several others show this) but it is even more discredited with respect to the Ancient Israelites were physicalists stuff."

3195,theist,sceptic,"   Hi Eric,      Now to address your other point on whether Jesus really meant for his followers (followers around AD30 and future generations after that) to “sell possessions” (Luke 12.33 & Luke 14.33):      Let us temporarily assume that Jesus’ words to the disciples and the crowd (Luke 12.33 and Luke 14.33) on “selling possessions to help the needy and thereby storing up treasures in heaven instead of storing up treasures on earth” have   (1) a 50% chance to mean either something else or to be not applicable to future generations of followers that come after the apostles’ generation   and   (2) a 50% probability to mean really “selling possessions to help the needy and thereby storing up treasures in heaven instead of storing up treasures on earth” for not only the apostle’s own generation but also the future generations of followers.      The disciples of the disciples of the apostles would probably have better understood Jesus’ intended meaning than other Christian’s who were born much later, and hence the teachings of the Christians from the first 300 years AD would tilt the above 50-50 balance towards one side.      Below are some quotes about Christians’ view of possessions from the first few centuries. (BTW these are not about Communism, in case anyone is saying that the early Christians were Communists.

2505,theist,sceptic,"In Dr. Feser's twitter account there was a response to the original tweets that I think captures what seems to me a very obvious problem with this criticism of Meyer. Jonathan wrote: ""I don’t think the point of these arguments is to make God contingent, but to argue for his existence probabilistically. I don’t see an issue with arguing for a metaphysically necessary being with abduction."" To object to this is to say that a contingent argument necessarily entails that the being argued for is contingent. That seems to me quite obviously false. It is the argument that is being characterized as contingent and this does not tell us that the being argued for is either contingent or necessary.      Dr. Feser responded to this tweet saying: ""I know they don't intend to make God contingent. But if an argument leaves it even possible that the world might exist apart from X, then to establish X isn't to establish God (Note that that doesn't entail that X is not God, but only that the arg doesn't establish that X is God)"" My response to this is that their aim is not to ""establish"" God (i.e. the God of Classical Theism who is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob). ID folks are very explicit about this. Their goal is not a scholastic demonstration. After all their arguments are contingent and proceed by way of abduction following the work of Pierce. That this approach does not get us all the way to classical theism and the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob seems to me no grounds for criticizing it as though it accomplishes nothing.      This appears to me like an older brother who is an exceptional and developed artist criticizing his younger brother for making initial efforts at art because those efforts are not as precise and clear. What would be the point of such an attack? It would certainly seem to me unnecessarily discouraging to the younger brother especially when the two approaches are not mutually exclusive.      The point I am making is consistent with Wuellner's definition: ""a conditional or provisional explanation of observed facts or of their connection with each other"". This can be taken in two ways. It can either entail that the existence of the thing that explains the phenomena is contingent and that its relationship to the thing caused is contingent *OR* it could mean that the explanation qua explanation is contingent (i.e. a contingent argument). Is it not entirely consistent with classical theism to recognize the latter possibility with abduction? It is not obvious to me why not.      It seems that Dr. Feser's answer to this is that an abductive approach can only show causal links that are themselves contingent (""because the causal relationship between them, even if real, is going to be contingent."") It is not clear to me why Dr. Feser thinks it is the case that contingent arguments entail that the being argued for is itself contingent and this seems to me to get at the crux of the issue."
4789,theist,sceptic,"Moreover, Dreyfus points out, this computationalist model is an inheritance from the post-Cartesian approach to scientific explanation, according to which explaining a physical event involves identifying the laws by which it follows of necessity from antecedent events, in a manner that might be modeled by a machine. But this mechanistic model only works when we abstract out of it anything that smacks of the psychological – consciousness, intentionality, and so on. (This is precisely why Descartes had to relocate consciousness out of the material world and in a separate _res cogitans_ , as Chomsky himself emphasizes later in the discussion with Goff and Frankish.) Hence an approach that appeals to computational rules, given its essentially mechanistic character, precisely _leaves out_ what is distinctive of the mental, and thus cannot coherently claim to _account for_ the mental."

2133,theist,sceptic,"Sorry, I thought I had logged in under my name. I was the Anon of 2:29 above.      _It is / uses a theory that starts from the notion of surplus value and the workers' creation of surplus value._      Since both capitalism and socialism agree that there is surplus value that arrives on account of labor's input, neither _the surplus_ nor that it comes from _labor_ can be used to distinguish between the two economic model groups. What distinguishes them is that the socialist model insists that the means of production must not be privately owned:      _a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole._      While it is facially possible to speculate on models that provide for instances where factories (and other means of production) are owned by lower- down entities than **the whole community** , there are two problems: (1) the fundamental criterion here is that _there is no choice_ about whether the property is owned by ""the community"", the state mandates it and enforces it. So, while some community other than ""the state"" may be the nominal owner, because the state sets all of the criteria of what constitutes a sufficiently non-private entity, the state necessarily is embroiled in controlling the conditions of ""ownership"" on a vastly more intrusive level than in private property. This takes many of the elements of the ""bundle of rights"" that constitute ownership and puts them into the state's hands. Nominal ownership and actual control are not the same.      (2) Nobody has successfully articulated an actually _workable_ plan by which ""the workers"" can exercise control over production without very heavy intrusion of state authority. Even the most optimistic of ideas - which have never actually been implemented in an actual state - effectively would entail government regulation of ""boards"" and ""committees"" and ""councils"". Stanford Encyclopedia's description:      _Finally, and crucially, economic coordination would be based on comprehensive participatory planning. This would involve a complex system of nested worker councils, consumer councils, and an Iteration Facilitation Board. Various rounds of deliberation within, and between, worker and consumer councils, facilitated by this board, would be undertaken until matches between supply and demands schedules are found—with recourse to voting procedures only when no full agreement exists but several promising arrangements arise._      Anybody who knows the least bit of the history of the National Labor Relations Board knows that anyone relying on the above description without imagining intense government intrusion is wearing rose-colored glasses.      Regardless, my essential point is that it in socialism it is NOT an option for ""the workers"" to decide to distribute the means of production that may be ""under their control"" to individuals, and this constitutes a very grave limitation on their ""control"", such that it severely constrains a claim that ""the state doesn't own the means of production"". Yes, as long as you understand all the qualifiers that make that less than _simply_ true. The further constraint on property that has the state determine what constitutes a sufficiently large-scale ""means of production"" to require it ceasing to be ownable by an individual or a small group of individuals, and the typical mechanisms by which the state wrests control away from said individuals, also constitute reservations on what is meant by saying the state ""does not own"" the property. Under socialism, whatever community ""owns"" the property is, ultimately, shored up under a system of state constraints on said property that limits their choices in very important ways.  "

3469,theist,sceptic," _But I put it to you that traditional, cosmological arguments have a problem of their own: all they establish is the existence of an Ultimate Cause, or Necessary Being, which may or may not be personal - i.e. an intelligent moral agent.      Defenders of the traditional arguments typically attempt to rectify this deficiency by arguing that (i) the Ultimate Cause or Necessary Being must be Pure Being itself,..._      Interestingly, St. Thomas gives _five separate proofs_ for the existence of God, the fifth of which hinges _explicitly_ on intelligent action, requiring an intelligent agent. While this is concededly not the cosmological argument, there is no reason why the same person cannot argue the cosmological argument AND the _order of the universe_ argument to assert that the root ""cause of being"" and the root ""cause of order"" is an intelligent God.      Sure, you could ask why those have to arrive at the _very same_ God, but there's no reason to _assume_ this is particularly difficult to address.      _Nor does God's intelligence follow from his being the Ultimate Cause, for the cause of X need not possess any knowledge of X._      But you cannot go the other way: it is impossible for the root cause of the order being different from the cause of being of everything (but itself), because if the cause of being is not intelligent, it cannot be the source of the intelligence that is the source of order in the universe, and it is impossible that the cause of _being_ of the universe act _independently_ of the cause of the order and still be the **root** cause of being of an ordered universe."

1717,theist,sceptic,"I posted the stuff above about GC. The standard view about elements in Aristotle is this:   "". For Aristotle an element of something is the most basic constituent of that thing. It is indivisible into   things that are different in form, which is to say that it cannot be analysed into further constituents - or 'elements' - of its own. The elements of bodies, then, are the simplest constituents of bodies (Metaph. V.3, 10l4a26-34, De cáelo III. 3, 302al4-21). ... Aristotle analyses fire, air, water, and earth into more fundamental constituents. Consequently the latter - usually believed to be the primary   'qualities', the contraries hot and cold, dry and wet, and often also 'prime   matter' - are more deserving of the name στοιχεία, or 'elements'. These items - the contraries alone, or together with prime matter - are considered the true elements of bodies because together they compose fire, air, water, and earth... in his view, fire, air, water, and earth are not elements strictly speaking, because they reveal under analysis further, more fundamental, that is, more elemental, items."" ~ Timothy J. Crowley, Phronesis 2008.      In the Meteorologica, Ari says that what we call fire is different from ""real fire,"" which is an excess of heat. The problem I'm puzzling over - and not just now, though Prof. Feser's review recalled it - is what happens when, say, a hot thing is destroyed. ""The hot"" in it doesn't just poof out of actuality and revert to prime matter. Something hot is left over and is a constituent of a new thing. So it's a puzzle, how ""the hot"" would NOT be a constituent of either the prior or the subsequent heated substance.      This question recurs when we substitute protons and neutrons or whatever for ""the hot/cold/wet/dry."" For Aristotle, ""an 'element', strictly speaking, is the primary material constituent into which bodies divide, or into which bodies can be analysed {Metaph. V.3, 10l4a31-34; De cáelo III.3, 302al4-19; cf.   Metaph. III.3, 998a22-b4; cf. Metaph. VII. 17, 104lb31: στοιχεῖον δ' εστίν εἰς ὃ διαιρεῖται ἐνυπάρχον ὡς ὕλη)"" ~ Crowley.      One may say, we never have ""the hot"" just by itself apart from substances that are hot. On the other hand, ""the hot"" bridges across corruption and generation, so it's hard to see how it exists only potentially apart from either substance. It does work during the bridge, so it seems to persist in act. Lindsay Judson said in a colloquium that what persists from corruption to generation is just the hot's ""extension."" Unfortunately, I never got the chance to ask him to develop this thought afterwards."

596,theist,sceptic,"When related to quantum mechanics it makes no sense to speak decently of the parts and the whole while doing the economy to really understand what the difference between pure and mixed states is: which, actually, is what leads to the deep understanding of the Bell’s inequalities.   It is also meaningless to talk about Aristotelian forms if we tend to interpret them like “shapes” having measurable extensions and movements: potency is, per definition, not actual and cannot be described in terms of measurements. But potency is real, like QM shows, and the interaction of a quantum system with an instrument can be perfectly described in term of measurements.   To understand that a potency is not localized in any point of space and time till it interacts with an instrument, we can give the ideal example of a bridge long 300’000 km, one quality of the bridge is to be breakable, the measurement of this property will consist in trying to break that bridge, if the measurement is successful that bridge will be broken in whatever point, then we will not have a breakable bridge but a broken bridge, i.e. the actual state of the bridge will bridge will change from breakable into broken and this concern the whole bridge, independently from it length and independently from the time needed for the information to be shared at both ends of the bridge: whatever will be measured at that time is simply the fact that that bridge is broken.   There is a paradigm that twists the mind of too many people, even physicists, when thinking about a physical system: in the Aristotelian world as well as in the Quantum world which just need two assumption to perfectly define a physical system, namely the fact that (a) for each physical state it exists another which is orthogonal to itself and (b) that movement consists in loosing some properties (which become orthogonal) while getting other which were potentially accessible; in the Newtonian/classical physics there is a third assumption which is claimed, but unnecessary in Quantum and Aristotelian physics, which is the fact that one requires (c) that the result of an experience must be either actual or potential.   The fact that there is no need of (c) in the “daily’s everybody’s physics” like the Aristotelian one as well as in the Quantum one, shows that there is unity of being and logic and little solution of continuity between both interpretative bodies.

2022,sceptic,theist,"Tangentially, it can be granted that a weak pluralism should be allowed if only because foundationalist axioms can apply to logical and mathematical theorems. There are pure or abstract logical and mathematical theorems that have no correspondence to reality and as such, correspondence theory of truth has limits. For example, when doing mathematical proofs, there are multiples sets N (the set of natural numbers), Z ( the set of integers), Q (the set of rational numbers), and R (the set of real numbers); there are also D (the set of decimals) and C (the set of complex numbers), which are less common in proofs. One may come across a statement that reads “n ∈ Z,” which states that n is an element within the set of integers. More specifically, one might be asked to prove the statement “∀n ∈ Z . n(n + 1) is even.” This can be done by assuming that some natural number n is either odd or even. Upon making n = 2m, one will find that 2(m(n+1) and 2(nm) are both even, which proves the statement. This mathematical proof does not rely on tangible reality in the way someone may point to a polar bear on television to prove that the proposition “polar bears are white” is true. There are also properties in mathematics that are true by definition, i.e., _a priori_ , e.g., zero product property, associative property.

1988,theist,sceptic,"One should never murder anyone. Killing, on the other hand, can sometimes be justified.      One question about killing the leader of an invading country is whether the leader counts as a civilian, since the killing of civilians is forbidden by the Geneva Convention. There is also some worry about the Geneva Convention's killing by ""perfidy"", which is taken to rule out at least some assassinations. So, as a matter of positive international law, it seems a difficult question.      Were there no international law on the matter, I wouldn't see a significant difference between killing a political leader and killing a general, if both are giving orders to fight. Morally speaking, but not necessarily in international law, both seem to me to be equally combatants.      Besides the moral and legal questions, there is also a prudential question. In my post I assumed that killing the general would stop the invasion. I got to assume that because I was making up the case. Whether in actual fact killing a leader would stop an invasion is less clear. Indeed such a thing might be seen as such a serious attack on the country that the retaliation might be really horrific."

He was not an Augustine or Luther. He does not appear to have been afflicted with an introspective and anxious conscience. But then the risen Lord revealed himself to Saul. His life and beliefs were turned upside- down. If God had indeed raised the Nazarene from the dead, ahead of the general resurrection and against all expectation, then Paul had to understand why.

None of us knows how God thinks. We just know that if He is infallible, His decisions are infallible.       _Conditional necessity would take this form:   in every possible world in which God decides to create this universe, this universe and no other universe obtains.   But since you say that God's decision to create this world exists in every possible world, you get: in every possible world , this universe and no other universe obtains.      So, you are in fact the one who collapses conditional necessity into absolute necessity, because you introduce a necessary condition._      Again, there is no “modal collapse” at all. Everybody agrees that if God exists, He exists in every possible world (PW). As you probably know, I’m not a fan of possible worlds analysis, but we’ll go with it. Why does God exist in every possible world? He exists because He is, by definition, absolutely necessary. If He weren’t, then He could differ from world to world. But given His absolute necessity, there is no PW without God. There is thus no “collapse” of modality from world to world; He is always absolutely necessary. If God is omnipotent in World 1, He is omnipotent in World 2. God’s will is one with God’s power, so His will cannot vary from PW to PW. So, no collapse occurs.      Similarly, the modality of creation’s contingent status remains the same from PW to PW. Since it is always reliant on an extrinsic cause, it is impossible for its contingent modality to collapse into absolute necessity. To insist otherwise is to equivocate.      Could there have been a universe with unicorns? Again, as a logical possibility, yes. We don’t know everything about God’s perfect intentions. If unicorns fit into His will, then we will have unicorns. If not, then we won’t."

(See pp. 139-51 of my book _[Aristotle’s Revenge: The Metaphysical Foundations of Physical and Biological Science](https://www.amazon.com/Aristotles-Revenge- Metaphysical-Foundations-Biological/dp/3868382003/)_ __ for detailed discussion of the intractable problems facing verificationism.)"
463,theist,sceptic,"Natural reason remains fallible. This is also true for natural theology. Seen from the point of faith, however, the existence of God is a praeambulum fidei. This means that for the Christian, belief in the existence of God participates in the certainty of faith or supernatural revelation."
5369,theist,sceptic,Just a cheap trick to drive up the clicks. But Duns Scotus does make an appearance in the current issue of _Faith and Philosophy_. Here is the abstract:
3948,theist,sceptic,"Vincent, at the risk of being a scold, you should really know better than to throw out some of these criticisms, most of which are either misunderstandings or irrelevancies. You've been around here long enough to be able to get the picture:      1) Parts stand in potential to the whole qua substance. The whole stands in potential to the parts qua composite. The claim is not that the whole is prior to the part in literally every respect. So of course the Thomist can have both statements, because the statements aren't claiming incompatible things.      2) Who knows whether nebulae, galaxies, etc. are substances? My suspicion is no, but that the question is a difficult one to answer as a matter of fact shouldn't much be surprising. Nothing about hylomorphism says it must be easy to discern what is a substance and what is not.      3) Koons explicitly rejects the idea that particles are fundamental, so this is a moot point.      4) For heaven's sake, not this objection of ""Aristotle's science held different conclusions and paradigms from contemporary science"" again. We know. But this is not what Koons is setting out to defend. You assert that QM does nothing to support a hylomorphic philosophy of nature and then go on to speak about, not matter and form, but certain niceties of Aristotle's account of accidents (i.e. place, relation, position/posture, etc.) which don't directly bear on hylomorphism at all."
518,sceptic,theist,"Hitchens wrote one of the only critical books on Mother Teresa in existence (according to Larivée, it’s one of about a half dozen). Hitchens had the opportunity to speak to Mother Teresa personally and offered his criticism of some of her practices. He reported, “It was by talking to her that I discovered, and she assured me, that she wasn’t working to alleviate poverty. She was working to expand the number of Catholics. She said, ‘I’m not a social worker, I don’t do it for this reason. I do it for Christ, I do it for the church.’” So don’t take my word for it, take _her_ word for it. She’s not doing social work; she’s only trying to convert more Catholics."

5636,sceptic,theist,"I do not deny the strength of this argument given that the child in question is not born into poverty or domestic violence and more importantly, that the child’s mother is not giving birth under duress, i.e., giving birth because her government leaves her with no other option. Marquis’ argument has considerable force given that a mother or couple are in good position to raise a child. While it is still ultimately her choice, it would be strange if she did not find other recourses to prevent pregnancy, especially given that she is sufficiently educated and affluent. It will be an instance of a bad choice begetting another bad choice, but even cases like this are outside of my jurisdiction. More importantly, this is all beside the point."

476,sceptic,theist,"[P]recisely because the principle of inertia treats uniform local motion as a ‘state,’ it treats it thereby as the _absence_ of change. … In this case, the question of how the principle of motion and the principle of inertia relate to one another does not even arise, for there just _is_ no motion (in the relevant, Aristotelian sense) going on in the first place when all an object is doing is ‘moving’ inertially in the Newtonian sense. To be sure, acceleration would in this case involve motion in the Aristotelian sense, but as we have seen, since Newtonian physics itself requires a cause for accelerated motion, there is not even a prima facie conflict with the Aristotelian principle of motion. (2013, pp. 239, 250-251)"
1221,sceptic,theist,"I find this odd. Notice that the doctrine only seems incoherent because I have mischaracterized it. I’ve seen this strategy before. I have constantly put up with Thomists claiming that the only reason one might disagree with the great and infallible Aquinas is because they have misunderstood Aquinas. Norman Geisler used to do this all the time, and things have not really changed much since then."

1860,theist,sceptic,"Attacking Edmund Burke is the last thing we need. Aren't you aware of his commitment to natural law?      Order, and Conservatism's respect for tradition ( along the lines of Burke's Conservatism at least) are in desperately short supply. As several scholars have established, Burke's ideals are not unlike (and may even derive from) the teaching of Saint Thomas Aquinas.      As for Baroque art, your theory is overstated. Where I am, at least, Catholic churches were generally neo-Gothic."
205,theist,sceptic,"My hunch is virtually all who defend ECT do so for similar reasons. Those reasons constrain, and can even silence, the moral imagination – which just shows how powerful our sense of belonging is when it’s connected to religious identity. And there’s nothing wrong with the power of that combination as such. But it does mean that sometimes immediate existential needs (individual and social) trump moral values. We tend to morally approve of what creates and strengthens our connections and disapprove of what fragments and isolates us."
2316,sceptic,theist,"Sommers believes that we are capable of “reorient[ing] our understanding of justice to reflect what’s true and good about revenge without incurring its unacceptable costs”, but that this would likely require a more fundamental reevaluation of our Enlightenment values and our rejection of honor culture. Honor can ward off cowardice, shamelessness, and selfishness. Properly contained, it can engender courage, integrity, self-respect, loyalty, solidarity, and potentially cure some measure of alienation and atomization. If you’re at all interested in moral philosophy and moral psychology, I can’t recommend the book enough (and if that doesn’t convince you, then buy it to help assuage my guilt over including a gigantic blockquote)."

3167,theist,sceptic,"@WCB. There was a recent post that denied God's existence based on the claim that the existence of ugliness in the world impugned God's beauty. It seems that your claim is that God exists, but is not good; or that God exists, but is not all powerful. Either way, you take being all powerful and all good as mutually exclusive given the state of suffering in the world. I will post the response that I gave on the compatibility of the beauty of God and ugliness in the world as I touched on the coherence of the classicial view as it relates to the problem of evil. I wrote:      This is a crude variation of the problem of evil as an argument against the existence of God. The argument from the problem of evil can be constructed as follows: 1. Evil exists, 2. If God is all good and all powerful, He could and would remove evil from the world, 3. As He has not done so, God does not exist.      The variation you have presented attends not to goodness and evil, but to beauty and ugliness and could be constructed similarly. 1. Ugliness exists, 2. If God were all beautiful and all powerful, He could and would eliminate ugliness in the world. 3. As He has not done so, God does not exist.      The reason that I refer to your variation as crude is because you introduce ambiguous language (""sustain ugliness"") and you don't bother to construct your argument well. I have helped with that above, but you have neither had the courtesy of offering a basic definition of key terms like beauty and ugliness (something that could be done in a relatively brief manner even in a blog combox) nor made the effort to understand how a Thomist might define these terms.      To help remedy the latter problem, St. Thomas understands beauty in terms of order and proportion. Something is beautiful to the extent that it is proportionate or well ordered. For example, a face is beautiful in its structure to the extent that its parts are proportionate to the whole and manifest the order of symmetry. A symphony is beautiful to the extent that it’s notes fit with one another in a melodious order. Writing can also have a cadence to it that makes it beautiful. Computer codes are described by programmers as elegant or beautiful to the extent that they are well constructed. So fittingness or order are essential features of beauty. Something that is beautiful is well ordered.      Conversely ugliness is a lack of order. A face is ugly because it lacks order and is misshapen or misfigured. A symphony is ugly when the notes are not related in a melodious order. Writing is ugly when it is poorly constructed and lacks order. Finally, computer codes lack elegance and beauty when they lack structure and order.      Ugliness is both logically and metaphysically posterior to beauty. It is logically posterior to beauty in that beauty consists of right order or proportion and ugliness is privation of that order/proportion. The order is more fundamental metaphysically in that there are consistent patterns to the operation of the natural world. The natural world operates according to laws that can be known. The movement of the planets and laws of motion are so ordered that they can be understood with mathematical precision.      This order is so normal to us that we expect it and are shocked when it is absent. We go to a symphony and expect beauty and are angry when we have paid good money and the notes are cacophinuos rather than melodiously well ordered. We are shocked by a misfigured face in a way that we are not shocked at a particularly beautiful face. The reason for this is that we expect beauty as more fundamental to reality than ugliness.

4883,theist,sceptic,"To borrow a line from the movie _12 Monkeys_ , “science ain’t an exact science.” To be sure, there is an exactness in its purely mathematical aspects, but that is precisely because mathematical representations simply leave out all aspects of reality that don’t fit that exact mode of representation – which turns out to be quite a lot. There are not only more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of by scientists, there is more _to science itself_ than is dreamt of by them."
