4198,theist,sceptic,"Vincent,   Jaegwon Kim, a prominent physicalist working on the mind-body problem concedes that the default position of human societies is not physicalism but dualism: “Something like this dualism of personhood, I believe, is common lore shared across most cultures and religious traditions.” (Mind in a Physical World: An Essay on the Mind-Body Problem and Mental Causation; Cambridge: MIT Press, 2000). Charles Taliaferro lists Michael Levin, Daniel Dennett, David Lewis, Thomas Nagel, J. J. C. Smart, Richard Rorty, Donald Davidson, and Colin McGinn as other non-dualist scholars working in philosophy of mind who concede that some commonsense view of dualism is held by the overwhelming number of humankind now and throughout history. Children are dualists. As Henry Wellman puts it, the recent findings of developmental psychology show that ""young children are dualists: knowledgeable of mental states and entities as ontologically different from physical objects"" (The Child's Theory of Mind; Cambridge: MIT Press, 1990). The presumption follows that Ancient Israel, like other ancient societies, would have held this commonsense dualism unless one can find evidence otherwise. What the Christian who claims that the Hebrew Bible advocates physicalism over dualism needs are arguments in the Hebrew Bible countering the prevailing assumption by ancient peoples of a basic dualism. There are none. The Hellenization thesis, as applied to physicalism, is a complete dud. Instead, basic dualism is at least the operating principle of the Hebrew Bible. And as bad as the position of Nancey Murphey, Brian Rosner, Paul Althaus and other Christian physicalists is, at least they are not global physicalists, i.e. they acknowledge that God is not composed of waves and limited to the speed of light.   The Hellenization thesis is discredited with regards to doctrines like divine impassibility (Paul Gavrilyuk and several others show this) but it is even more discredited with respect to the Ancient Israelites were physicalists stuff."

4535,theist,sceptic,"@RunDec      Given that, as I understand it, to qualify as a classical theist, a thinker has to, principally, adhere to divine simplicity, I readily concede that this is compatible with a necessitarian view, and that of many thinkers classified as such. This compatibility, however, obviously does not entail its truth. Fr. Davies seems to concern himself with rebutting the claim that divine simplicity entails it, and to achieve this he doesn’t need to positively prove the account he happens to think is the true classical theist account, namely, presumably that of St. Thomas. After all, it’s not like classical theism is a concrete comprehensive philosophical doctrine or “system” as opposed to a (contingently useful) classification abstracting from the all-important theoretical peculiarities.      Now, in light of your reference to pure act, I assumed that it is this account that you had in mind, and I submit that, I find, the way the pure act argument works is straightforward, really: agents act for an end, and where there is no necessary relation between the means and an end, there is no necessity. Because, on the one hand, God is pure act, something per se perfect, and is the only possible end for His acts, and creatures fail to contribute anything to His perfection, on the other, God cannot be said to will the creatures necessarily. See e.g. Ia q. 19 a. 3.   And, naturally, Thomists do make arguments for their views e.g. on the teleological nature of causation that allow them to make this argument."

Moreover, suppose God changes in performing such choices. Such changes are not inexplicable; they are explained in terms of more fundamental features of God, e.g., God’s desires, reasons, beliefs, character, goodness, and the like, or perhaps in terms of God _qua_ agent. Thus, under this view, no change or actualization of potential goes unexplained, _and yet there is no purely actual being_."

3751,theist,sceptic,"The scientific description of light as an appearance characterized by both particles and waves is further explained and unified if light is understood and observed to be always in a spiral or helix form - like the material form of DNA, which is, itself, a direct materialization of the structure of light.   If a spiral-form is seen at its point of rotation, or its crossover point, it is observable as a ""particle"". And if the same spiral-form is seen with reference to its limbs of rotation, before or after its point of rotation, or its crossover point, it is observable as a ""wave"".   So, also, light is observable as both ""particle"" or ""wave"", depending on which phase of its process is observed by attention, or point of view in time and space.   A vibrating string can be seen to demonstrate the same spiraliform gait as any mode of observable light. And, so, as a kind of poetic inspiration, modern scientists have produced numerous string theories, in their search for the presumed knowledge that will supposedly explain everything.   Nevertheless, whether light is observed and, thus understood as a ""particle"" or a ""wave"" or as a string, that observation or understanding is, itself an act of perspectival objectification, wherein and whereby Reality Itself is reduced, by the very act of observation, or understanding or mental fabrication, to a relation and, thus, a subordinate of attention, or point of view of the presumed separate ego-""I"".

Apart from point of view, are there any ""objects"" (as such), or any differences at all?

3613,sceptic,theist,"Although a foot causing an impression in some sand from eternity past is a common example of a cause that does not precede its effect, we do not find the example convincing. According to accounts on which causes are substances that produce their effects, why think that the foot must have _produced_ the impression in the sand? Consider, for example, a situation in which there already existed an impression in some sand and, at some subsequent time, a foot exactly matching the impression comes to rest in the impression. Although one could argue that some cause needs to be posited to explain the shape of the impression or to explain why the impression exactly matches the foot, the foot would not be posited as the mediate cause of the impression. We can consider moving the time that the foot comes to rest in the impression arbitrarily far into the past. Points at positive or negative infinity are not standardly included on the real line. Therefore, when we move the event of the foot coming to rest in the impression infinitely far into the past, we remove that event from the timeline altogether. Since, by construction, the production of the impression occurred prior to the foot coming to rest in the impression, we would also have removed the production of the impression from the timeline. There would be no event involving the creation of the impression. So, where some have argued that the foot is the eternal cause of the impression, we can instead imagine that the foot and impression have simply co-existed for all eternity without positing that one is the cause of the other.[14] Whatever one might make of this argument, we think that there is a deeper reason to deny simultaneous causation."

It seems very natural to say that in that case the rock failed to do what rocks should do!

(This is precisely why Descartes had to relocate consciousness out of the material world and in a separate _res cogitans_ , as Chomsky himself emphasizes later in the discussion with Goff and Frankish.)

903,theist,sceptic," _The ""form"" is not an illusion in the sense that it doesn't exist at all, it is an illusion because it doesn't exist as a somehow semi-independent quality._      The problem is that this really doesn't solve the problem; other than a chair, the problems of reducing the function of sensory organs to mere arrangements is more apparent. But that should be there minor quibble here. (It should be said though that the chair in itself has ascribed properties it mere parts lack, e.g. its shape, which makes the mereological nihilism you're hinting at quite implausible. Ever the more so for a biological organ)      More importantly, the goal should be to undermine skepticism. And this is actually only possible if we suppose that a function is fulfilled here. An eyeball displaying illusions is only wrong (wrong as the normative judgment that it's not doing its job) insofar as there is an objectively correct mode of observation that the eyeball in question is incapable to represent. That is only something a form with a corresponding final cause is able to sustain. In either the atomist or the monist worldview, this idea has no room, since the arrangement is always only shape-wise, an imitation instead of a real member. If we take the two options seriously we have no reason to assume the observed data we're witnessing is actually reality representing.      Of course we can't guarantee that with the Aristotelian conception either, after all they could malfunction right now. But the point is, similar to the debate about causation of contingent events, which worldview actually allows us rationally to employ phenomenal conservatism, and that's just what Koons describes here.      Side note, purpose doesn't necessarily mean purposefully shaped or done that way, but also can refer to functions and usability. In that sense, the razor shaped stone can absolutely be directed towards one of its purposes (final causes) through using it as a razor."

3082,theist,sceptic,"Goff’s and Frankish’s conversation with Chomsky ends with a brief discussion of matters of politics and economics. Chomsky says that the excesses of 1920s capitalism were corrected to some extent beginning in the 30s, leading eventually to a somewhat more humane form of capitalism by the 50s and 60s. Then, he thinks, Reagan and Thatcher turned the world back in the direction of something like the 1920s kind of capitalism. But, he suggests, something like the reforms that partially corrected that kind of capitalism might occur again."

4039,sceptic,theist,"Modern scientists are then tasked with working backwards. The alternative to that is to undertake the gargantuan task, as Cartwright puts it, of deriving the initial properties, which would no doubt be tantamount to a Theory of Everything from which all of the systems of laws extend, i.e., hypothesize that initial conditions _q_ , _r_ , and _s_ yield the different systems of laws we know. This honors the concretism Lanao and Teh call for in scientific models while also giving abstractionism its due. Like Paul Davies offered, the laws of physics may be [frozen accidents](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/frozen-accidents-can-the- laws-of-physics-be-explained/). In other words, the effective laws of physics, which is to say the laws of physics we observe, might differ from the fundamental laws of physics, which would be, so to speak, the original state of the laws of physics. In a chaotic early universe, physical constants may not have existed. Hawking also spoke of physical laws that tell us how the universe will evolve if we know its state at some point in time. He added that God could have chosen an “initial configuration” or fundamental laws for reasons we cannot comprehend. He asks, however, “if he had started it off in such an incomprehensible way, why did he choose to let it evolve according to laws that we could understand? (Hawking, Stephen. _A Brief History of Time_ , New York: Bantam Books. 1988. 127. Print.)” He then goes on to discuss possible reasons for this, e.g. chaotic boundary conditions; anthropic principles."

They’re offering good arguments. When non-physicalists level objections to physicalism, they’re right! They’re offering good arguments. Rather than thinking “All these options suck,” you could just as well think that everyone is making cogent points all around. There are good arguments against materialism, dualism, panpsychism, and so on; there are really compelling reasons to reject each of these options. Maybe there are deep, in principle reasons we can’t come up with a satisfying explanation of consciousness."

However, it makes no sense at all to say “I have knowledge, but not a belief.” Again, if you have a belief, that does _not_ mean you have no evidence, or you take it on faith, or anything like that. It just means you affirm a proposition."

4454,theist,sceptic,"@Walter. I agree we’re going around in circles. I could use an analogy of a mother shouting at her daughter to get out of the busy road, and of the elder brother feeling empathy for his sister while accepting that the telling off was necessary. However you will take that in a univocal sense where you can’t translate this onto the big picture, or focus on the idea that I’m claiming that suffering is God ‘telling us off’, which is not the point at all.      I don’t claim to understand the whole picture, but there is a beauty in the universe that relies on this balance between the good stuff and the bad stuff, where our overcoming of difficulties are in a way more valuable because of the difficulties. Without decay physical reality would be a disgusting mess, without suffering our bodies could not have evolved. If you see the physical world as everything, and our physical existence as the peak of some very lucky random circumstances over time, as I did as an atheist, then the idea of this physical universe as a phase of an essentially spiritual creation process makes no sense at all. So instead you decide that a good God would instead just create something like angels in a paradise, and not bother with the often messy physical universe and human beings at all. Which seems to me to loose a great deal of richness from existence, for all it’s troubles. Some of the angels seem to have had this view, so at least you’re not alone!      Thanks for the chat."

1194,theist,sceptic,"This point is not very strange or controversial, I think, as it formalizes the ‘hopeful’ reasoning by which Christians typically respond to evils in their life:"
1654,theist,sceptic,"""Suppose, for example, that someone said that he was contemplating Aquinas’s First Way or... I personally think both those arguments happen to be successful demonstrations of God’s existence.""      The First Way attempts to use scientifically testable observations as a basis for logical arguments for the existence of god.      The First Way is an argument from motion, which is offered in the general sense of change of heat in the example of heat-fire-wood. Motion is also used in its more common literal sense, as positional translation through space, in the example of hand-staff.      Thus, if one is using the First Way as an argument for the existence of god then the assertion of the existence of god is indeed a scientific hypothesis in that the examples of the First Way are scientifically falsifiable.      Science has already falsified the argument from motion, therefor the god hypothesis has been scientifically falsified, to the extent it depends upon the First Way, which has already been falsified.      The statement ""the staff moves only because it is put in motion by the hand"" is clearly false, as the staff will move ad infinitum (as Aristotle posited for motion in the void) absent an impeding medium. The fundamental error of Aristotle, Aquinas, Feser, and the majority of posters here is in failing to realize that space, for motion, is the functional equivalent of the void, and everything is in space, including the hand and the staff.      The false statement by Aquinas that ""the staff moves only because it is put in motion by the hand"" is based on the false notion that absent a continuous mover the staff will slow, and stop, and its motion will be lost, therefore, it was incorrectly thought, a mover is required to keep it moving.      In truth, all objects in the universe are part of a system of perpetual motion such that motion is never lost, only transferred and mutually perpetuated in some form.      ""arguing that nothing that is like that could exist even for an instant without a sustaining cause""   Feser has this back to front in a very strange inversion of logic.      If material exists at time1 and continues to exist at time2 that is no change in the existence of that material, therefore no changer is called for to account for no change.      If material exists at time1 and ceases to exist at time2 that is a change in the existence of that material, therefore a changer is called for to account for the change in the existence of that material.      Sustained existence = no change, therefore, no changer.   Unsustained existence = change, therefore, a changer.      Pretty simple. How Feser and all the good posters here can be confused on such an obvious point is a puzzlement indeed."

4003,sceptic,theist,"Since the Bible is the genesis of all knowledge of God, I have made it my mission to read every single word. I am fascinated by Christians who believe it is infallible. It is perfectly written, without fault, lies, or falsehoods, and it contains the very words of God. I wonder about those who profess this belief while having failed to read every word God has written. I will spare everyone the beginning because you are all familiar enough with the story of Adam and Eve. I will just pause to wonder why God would set Adam up for failure. If he did not want Adam to eat from the tree, then why was the tree in the Garden? Perhaps God wanted him to eat from the tree? Well then, why punish him and Eve for doing so? And why would he allow that wily serpent to be in their midst? Surely, God, being omniscient, had to have known that Eve would be powerless to resist the serpent’s deception. And if he saw Adam failing and the cascade of consequences that would follow, why not scrap this plan and start from a reality in where Adam succeeds in obeying him? This is the first, original sin and the reason why I am wretched, the Christian preaches. This just is not fair because who is to say that I would have failed where Adam did. Or you, for that matter! If any one of us would have failed in Adam’s stead, then we were already flawed to begin with. A perfect god created an imperfect man…on purpose."

The Empire State Building is ~443. The Chrysler is ~318m. Granted, this is knowledge by way of _testimony_. I do not intend to connote religious testimony. What I intend to say is that one’s knowledge is grounded on knowledge directly acquired by someone else. In other words, at least one other person actually measured the heights of these buildings and these are the measurements they got."

1041,theist,sceptic,"Finally, experimentation too, Cartwright argues, is a much more complex affair than is implied by the common notion that “science = theory + experiment.” Experiment is often treated as if its only point is to test theory. But that is not the case. Sometimes experimentation is carried out even in the absence of any well-worked out theory, in an _exploratory_ way that aims simply to see what will happen under various circumstances. Sometimes experimentation _creates_ new phenomena that would otherwise not be observed – where, precisely because they have not otherwise been observed, no theory yet exists to account for them. Sometimes experimentation _reconstitutes_ phenomena in the sense of deeply altering our understanding of them, even in the absence of theoretical considerations. And in all these cases, experimentation, like theory, depends on fixing the content of concepts, on models, and so on."
1983,sceptic,theist,"A) Even if we grant that unforeseen goods balance the scales, as it were, i.e. justifies the 1,800 cancer-related deaths of children per year in the United States, there is no way for finite human minds to causally connect these deaths with the goods whenever they arrive; the most we can do is callously reason that their deaths are akin to necessary sacrifices that enable us to eventually find a cure—which is related to minor problem (a) below and more importantly, is not something we should ever give God credit for; developing cures is a slow, painstaking process that does not involve anything like putative revelation or God whispering the secrets to a much needed vaccine in a doctor’s ear. There is also the issue that the goods may arrive well after our lifetimes, which segues into the next problem."

3560,sceptic,theist,"This distinction comes in handy when we’re discussing “ought implies can.” If determinism is true, then both P1 and P2 are false, in some sense. But we can easily imagine rolling a 1 (in fact, Dan has done it before). He couldn’t have, however, rolled a 0. Likewise, he can’t end world hunger, and is thus not obligated to end world hunger. Ought implies can. But given the opportunity to feed the hungry, he could’ve taken the opportunity even though he failed this time (in fact, he’s done it before). Dan is free of the obligation to end world hunger, but still feels a pang of conscience about failing to feed the hungry when given the opportunity. And for some strange reason, he finds no comfort in the truth of determinism. I would say he’s right to feel that way – he could’ve fed the hungry, and he should’ve."
4192,sceptic,theist,"They came, therefore, in a body to James, and said, “We entreat you, restrain the people: for they are gone astray in their opinions about Jesus, as if he were the Christ. We entreat you to persuade all who have come here for the day of the Passover, concerning Jesus. For we all listen to you; since we, as well as all the people, bear you testimony that you are just, and show partiality to none. Therefore, persuade the people not to entertain erroneous opinions concerning Jesus: for all the people, and we also, listen to you. Take your stand, then, upon the summit of the Temple, that from that elevated spot you may be clearly seen, and your words may be plainly audible to all the people. For, in order to attend the Passover, all the tribes have congregated here, and some of the Gentiles also.”"
828,sceptic,theist,"Most of our knowledge claims rest on testimony. Not everyone has performed an experimental proof to show that the acceleration of gravity is 9.8m/s^2. Either one learned it from a professor or read it in a physics textbook or learned it when watching a science program. Or, they believe the word of someone they trust, be it a friend or a grade school teacher. This does not change that fact that if one cared to, one could exchange knowledge by way of testimony for directly acquired knowledge by performing an experimental proof. This is something I have done, so I do not believe on basis of mere testimony that Newton’s law holds. I can say that it holds because I tested it for myself."
1973,theist,sceptic,"In his transcendent unity, God is his love, is his goodness, is his justice, is his omnipotence and omniscience, is his existence. Unlike all creaturely beings, which are characterized in various ways by the distinction between essence and existence, the Deity is not different from his existence: he is his own being. This does not mean that the divine essential divine attributes are synonymous in meaning. “What simplicity requires one to understand about all designations for the divine attributes,” Stump explains, “is that they are identical in reference but different in sense: they refer in differing ways to the single thing in act which is God.”4"

4603,sceptic,theist,"[8] Note that this is a stipulative definition of ‘destruction’. We recognize that it may sound odd to call it ‘destruction’.

What matters for present purposes is that we have a clear and precise definition of the relevant concept. If the reader still demurs at our usage, simply replace the word with another, more fitting one."

1961,theist,sceptic,"From an epistemological point of view, discussing science would be less controversial if we simply acknowledged and agreed that:      (1) Certainty (i.e., the judgement of ""truth"" when comparing what we know with our experiences) is limited to our own personal experiences and cannot be shared with others by definition.      (2) Objectivity (i.e., putting ourselves in the place of the object or pretending to represent its perspective) is an extrapolation that cannot be verified.      (3) Objectivity as impartiality is a matter of consensus among certainties communicated through language and agreement on a narrative.      (4) Mathematics is a human invention in the sense that its rules do not exist a priori in a realm of ideas. It is incorrect to imagine the object of mathematics as something to explore like an unknown land, but it is more akin to something we build like a Lego game. It is also a narrative, where formulas and diagrams are similar to Chinese ideograms in that they can be read and understood within their own cultural frames.      (5) Physics is a narrative, and the evaluation of its quality does not rely on its ability to predict, but on its ability to function as a useful and operational story, depending on the culture in which it is developed. There is no pretension of certainty or objectivity, only impartiality.      (6) Metaphysics is the only narrative that claims to develop a narrative that examines certainty and objectivity as defined above.      (7) What is common to all these narratives, what underlies them all, is logic, and for obvious reasons, the logic that is supported by our own certain experiences, as declined by Aristotle.  "

376,sceptic,theist,"Likewise, you and I are dependent beings in the sense that our continued existence depends upon a myriad of physical conditions, including temperature, pressure, entropy, the strong nuclear forces holding our atoms together, and the laws of physics. Additionally, we depend on biological processes such as blood flow, breathing, cell replication, energy production, etc. in order to exist. If these conditions or processes were removed or significantly altered, we would cease to exist at that moment. (Forthcoming)"
2600,theist,sceptic,"Now, someone might also object that an argument need not get you _all_ the way to God to get you _part_ of the way. And that is perfectly true. Suppose, for example, that some version of the argument from contingency (such as those defended by Avicenna, Aquinas, and Leibniz) really does demonstrate the existence of an absolutely necessary being. That would certainly do much to establish classical theism, even if one did not go on to show that this necessary being had further divine attributes such as omnipotence and omniscience. For necessity itself is one of the divine attributes, which radically differentiates God from everything else, so that to establish that something exists of necessity is a crucial step on the way to a complete argument for theism."

4378,theist,sceptic,"Yet these pseudo-questions seem, to Chomsky, to be the kinds that the discussion of the so-called hard problem focuses on. He doesn’t mention Nagel, but he seems clearly to have in mind questions like “What is it like to be a bat?” and the idea that neuroscientific research and the like cannot answer it. The reason there is such difficulty answering it, Chomsky thinks, is that interrogative sentences like these don’t convey genuine questions. What are labeled “easy questions” and “hard questions” concerning consciousness pretty much correspond, in Chomsky’s view, to genuine questions and pseudo-questions."

About seven in all, to go by the accounts of the time. Then the tale grew in the telling. Scientists who were present, including believers, saw nothing. Other legendary material soon accrued to the tale, such as the claim of driving rain all day beforehand that soaked the ground, and then the ground miraculously became dry…. All rubbish. Pictures of the crowd gathering for hours beforehand showed a clear dry day. One newspaper reported a small drizzle earlier in the day, and then that too was exaggerated."
214,theist,sceptic,"In Dr. Feser's twitter account there was a response to the original tweets that I think captures what seems to me a very obvious problem with this criticism of Meyer. Jonathan wrote: ""I don’t think the point of these arguments is to make God contingent, but to argue for his existence probabilistically. I don’t see an issue with arguing for a metaphysically necessary being with abduction."" To object to this is to say that a contingent argument necessarily entails that the being argued for is contingent. That seems to me quite obviously false. It is the argument that is being characterized as contingent and this does not tell us that the being argued for is either contingent or necessary.      Dr. Feser responded to this tweet saying: ""I know they don't intend to make God contingent. But if an argument leaves it even possible that the world might exist apart from X, then to establish X isn't to establish God (Note that that doesn't entail that X is not God, but only that the arg doesn't establish that X is God)"" My response to this is that their aim is not to ""establish"" God (i.e. the God of Classical Theism who is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob). ID folks are very explicit about this. Their goal is not a scholastic demonstration. After all their arguments are contingent and proceed by way of abduction following the work of Pierce. That this approach does not get us all the way to classical theism and the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob seems to me no grounds for criticizing it as though it accomplishes nothing.      This appears to me like an older brother who is an exceptional and developed artist criticizing his younger brother for making initial efforts at art because those efforts are not as precise and clear. What would be the point of such an attack? It would certainly seem to me unnecessarily discouraging to the younger brother especially when the two approaches are not mutually exclusive.      The point I am making is consistent with Wuellner's definition: ""a conditional or provisional explanation of observed facts or of their connection with each other"". This can be taken in two ways. It can either entail that the existence of the thing that explains the phenomena is contingent and that its relationship to the thing caused is contingent *OR* it could mean that the explanation qua explanation is contingent (i.e. a contingent argument). Is it not entirely consistent with classical theism to recognize the latter possibility with abduction? It is not obvious to me why not.      It seems that Dr. Feser's answer to this is that an abductive approach can only show causal links that are themselves contingent (""because the causal relationship between them, even if real, is going to be contingent."") It is not clear to me why Dr. Feser thinks it is the case that contingent arguments entail that the being argued for is itself contingent and this seems to me to get at the crux of the issue."
3706,sceptic,theist,"In the end, I think that the deepest level of analysis will involve a stochastic process in where degrees of probability encompass possible outcomes. Not every blow leads to a broken tibia. Dropping a glass cup on just any surface is not enough to crack or shatter it. There are cases in where angular momentum as a result of a human foot can change a falling glass cup’s trajectory just enough to ensure that it does not break upon hitting the ground. I have met people quite adept at breaking these kinds of falls with a simple extension of their foot. As such, probabilities will change given the circumstances on a case by case basis. This element of chance at the deepest level of analysis coheres perfectly with the universe we find ourselves in because even the fact that we are beings made of matter, as opposed to beings made of anti-matter, is due to chance. Apparently, God has always rolled dice. On this, I will let Lawrence Krauss have the last word:"
1174,sceptic,theist,"Some Christians might insist on missing the point of the argument by reminding us that even demons believe in God, which means we shouldn’t expect belief in God to always bear fruit. But the argument isn’t really about “believing in God”, full stop. It’s about _following_ God, following his commands, being in a personal relationship with God, being led by the Spirit and not just the flesh, bearing the fruits that the Bible says you’ll bear, being transformed by the power of Christ. This is about the expectations that Christians have _of themselves_ – _given_ their beliefs – and whether those expectations are panning out."

She said, ‘I’m not a social worker, I don’t do it for this reason. I do it for Christ, I do it for the church.’” So don’t take my word for it, take _her_ word for it.

5681,theist,sceptic,"Icons, images – of Christ, the Mother of God and the saints – came to be used widely in Christianity, not just as pictures on panels or walls (frescoes), but on sacred vessels, garments, banners and even more intimate objects such as boxes and rings. They are objects of devotion, rather than works of art (though many of them are works of art of superlative quality); they are there to accompany our prayer, to mediate to us the presence of those to whom we pray; they are not there for aesthetic contemplation (though many of them are worthy of that). Unlike symbols, they work more directly through likeness; it is through likeness that they recall the people whom they depict, though the concept of likeness appropriate to icons has evolved to fulfil the purpose of mediating a prayerful presence, rather than a photographic likeness. Their justification is manifold – and unlike other aspects of Christian worship and practice explicit, as a result of the century-long iconoclast controversy from the eighth to the ninth century in the Byzantine Empire."

Yet on Judaism and Christianity, god created the Earth. Modern science tells us that planets have no creator; they form naturally over an extended period of time. The history of our planet doesn’t resemble anything mentioned in the Bible. By extension, god doesn’t exist in relationship to the universe; he didn’t create it.
