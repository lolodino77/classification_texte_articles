1046,theist,sceptic,"The knowledge that God exists, i.e., that He is actual, is certainly not a matter of faith: understanding that God exists requires no faith but is very simple knowledge accessible to all honest people, where by honest we define people who do not declare false the true or true the false.   From a logical point of view, the existence of God is not an axiom, in that it is not a self-evident statement in itself; it is not a hypothesis for the excellent reasons developed by Prof Feser; it is not a conjecture in that it is not a judgment based on non-evidential data: the existence of God is a reality that is logically proven, that is, it is a theorem, that is, grounded in logic, but also one that can be intuited by anyone, even without the pedantic and explicit use of formal logical reasoning.   I refer, for example, to the work of Christoph Benzmüller (preprint arXiv:2202.06264, 2022) for the very short proof and I limit myself to quote here the three axioms he uses:   (1) for any entity the lack of any property is not positive, (2) any property caused by another positive property is necessarily also a positive property, (3) ""being divine"" is a positive property.   The discussion is thus to be centered not on the existence of God as such but on the meaning of each of these axioms in our real world.   As Feser himself well points out, only considerations of necessity, and never of contingency as such, can lead to the truth of the claim of God's existence.   Humans, at 90 percent, usually intuitively perceive the unity of being, its positivity, and come to the conclusion that there must be a God aimed to maintain the coherence of what is good, positive and non-contradictory in their own experiential experience, that is, they ""experience"" these three axioms and they honestly intuit the only possible logical consequence.",knowledge god exists ie actual certainly matter faith understanding god exists requires faith simple knowledge accessible honest people honest define people declare false true true false logical point view existence god axiom self-evident statement hypothesis excellent reason developed prof feser conjecture judgment based non-evidential data existence god reality logically proven theorem grounded logic also one intuited anyone even without pedantic explicit use formal logical reasoning refer example work christoph benzmüller preprint arxiv short proof limit quote three axiom us entity lack property positive property caused another positive property necessarily also positive property divine positive property discussion thus centered existence god meaning axiom real world feser well point consideration necessity never contingency lead truth claim existence human percent usually intuitively perceive unity positivity come conclusion must god aimed maintain coherence good positive non-contradictory experiential experience experience three axiom honestly intuit possible logical consequence

2263,sceptic,theist,"Of relevance here are the reasons for this improvement. Did the Church outlaw execution of non-Christians by way of edict or mandate? Did the Church ask its members to stop blacklisting books? I think that reasons are much more complex than the erred belief that the Church experienced a dramatic 180 with respect to its imperialist behaviors. Given the United States’ Constitutional emphasis on religious freedom, for instance, a slew of hate crimes against non- Christian places of worship will be prosecuted heavily. Secular laws have acted as a deterrent against the Church’s imperialist agenda. This applies in the UK and Canada as well.

1918,theist,sceptic,"When related to quantum mechanics it makes no sense to speak decently of the parts and the whole while doing the economy to really understand what the difference between pure and mixed states is: which, actually, is what leads to the deep understanding of the Bell’s inequalities.   It is also meaningless to talk about Aristotelian forms if we tend to interpret them like “shapes” having measurable extensions and movements: potency is, per definition, not actual and cannot be described in terms of measurements. But potency is real, like QM shows, and the interaction of a quantum system with an instrument can be perfectly described in term of measurements.   To understand that a potency is not localized in any point of space and time till it interacts with an instrument, we can give the ideal example of a bridge long 300’000 km, one quality of the bridge is to be breakable, the measurement of this property will consist in trying to break that bridge, if the measurement is successful that bridge will be broken in whatever point, then we will not have a breakable bridge but a broken bridge, i.e. the actual state of the bridge will bridge will change from breakable into broken and this concern the whole bridge, independently from it length and independently from the time needed for the information to be shared at both ends of the bridge: whatever will be measured at that time is simply the fact that that bridge is broken.   There is a paradigm that twists the mind of too many people, even physicists, when thinking about a physical system: in the Aristotelian world as well as in the Quantum world which just need two assumption to perfectly define a physical system, namely the fact that (a) for each physical state it exists another which is orthogonal to itself and (b) that movement consists in loosing some properties (which become orthogonal) while getting other which were potentially accessible; in the Newtonian/classical physics there is a third assumption which is claimed, but unnecessary in Quantum and Aristotelian physics, which is the fact that one requires (c) that the result of an experience must be either actual or potential.   The fact that there is no need of (c) in the “daily’s everybody’s physics” like the Aristotelian one as well as in the Quantum one, shows that there is unity of being and logic and little solution of continuity between both interpretative bodies.

4837,theist,sceptic,"@WCB (continued)      Another premise that requires analysis is the premise that we only merit temporary bodily suffering for our own misdeeds. That is a key premise to the suggestion that it is unjust for an innocent child to suffer from cancer or a tornado. Although the child has committed no wrong, he suffers. How in this world could this be just for God to allow this?      The fact that it is temporary and bodily suffering at least leaves open the possibility that such suffering may benefit the soul (either the child's soul or the soul of another person).      Sometimes the suffering of one person can be for the good of another person. This occurs in war and in the case of anyone who makes a sacrifice for someone else. The difference between the suffering of an adult in war is that such suffering is generally voluntary and the suffering of an innocent child is not. Yet this only poses a problem if we hold the premise that the child must understand the reason for his suffering for the suffering to have a reason. That is, again, a faulty premise as we need not understand all or any of the good that our suffering does for others for that suffering to in fact do such good.

The issue is that Bird and the Neo-Aristotelians who complain that he has not gone far enough have isolated what they take to be a power from the properties of an electron, which is a good example of a particle that repels negatively charged objects given that some are in its vicinity. Talk of possible worlds makes no sense _unless_ one can prove _mathematically_ that an electron-like particle with a different mass would also repulse other negatively charged particles. However, though it can easily be shown that a slightly more massive electron-like particle will repulse other particles of negative charge, its electrical charge will be slightly higher than an electrons because according to Robert Milikan’s calculation, there seems to be a relationship between the mass of a particle and its charge. The most elementary charge is e = ~1.602 x 10^19 coulombs. The charge of a quark is measured in multiples of e/3, implying a smaller charge, which is expected given that they are sub- particles.

3631,theist,sceptic,"@ Victor Torley,      We are speaking at opposed purposes, not cross-purposes.      :-)      ""the intrinsic properties of elementary particles (such as quarks and electrons) [...] do not change when particles are bound in a structure""      In quantum mechanics the properties and existence of a particle is known only through observed interactions with other particles and these interactions are certainly different when the particle is bound then it is when it is free, so it is merely semantics whether you call it the same particle or a different particle that is found by probing. It definitely has different properties. ""Intrinsic properties"" are properties with reference to ""self"" and are not directly accessible but are inferred by extrinsic measurement, which changes, as I said, when the probe is into a bound system versus into relatively free particles. A free particle is _potentially_ a bound particle if it can be taken up into the bound system (see that word root ""potential"" there and think of Aquinas when you do).      Another difficulty with your view is explaining how unique particles, like red blood cells (they are not identical), to which quantum mechanics also must apply, could be probed experimentally at all for fit with the laws of quantum mechanics. Red blood cells also exist in superpositions of states, but since each RBC is unique, there is no way to test its interactions for interference.      I spoke of a golf ball being in a different state after being knocked from a tee. Note that the state, when it is flying, is one which it is only potentially in before it is hit. It certainly has different properties which it only potentially had before being sent flying. Get in the way of the flying ball. It hurts, but the ball sitting on the tee doesn't.      Your propositional distributive law is not about intrinsic properties either. Particles behave. They do not do logic calculations with propositions.

In which case, that is the exact opposite of a Cambridge property which is an extrinsic relation that is outside of God. Aquinas says, “God does not act by an action that is outside Him, as though it went out from Him and terminated in a creature.”[24] According to Aquinas, “The manifold actions ascribed to God, like intelligence, volition, _the production of things_ , and the like, are not so many different things, since each of these actions in God is His very being, which is one and the same thing.”[25] For some reason I thought Aquinas said that.

3694,theist,sceptic,"(Continuation)      So not just it's unfair and wrong to say that ""this usage is common to Aristotle"" but one thing that I noticed in the book of both authors is the somewhat intentional sidestep or ""shell game"" of problems - like they were trying intentionally guide the book in a way to evade potential questions to their points. To be fair, Siderits tried to address some points of that (I do recommend the reading of the Chapter 4 since the most relevant discussion of points that could be related to our philosophy concentrates there). But his position simply gives me the impression that he tries to misplace the substance into its parts (like a shell game) and then comes to the conclusion that the substance could not exist. In responding to how accidents are always found in the substances (he does not use the term accidents, I'm using it to simplify) if they do not exist, he says:      ""Consider the water atom as an allegedly indivisible substance in which inhere the qualities of color, shape, wetness and mass. Resistance to the notion that these qualities may be thought of as its parts comes from the intuition that qualities do not simply float freely in the air, that they must be tethered to something that then explains their occurrence together with other qualities. Bundle theorists are typically asked to provide the principle of qualitative unity that would explain the co- occurrence of many qualities in the absence of a substance in which they inhere. The Buddhist bundle theorist says this is the wrong question to be asking. Instead we should ask why, in the absence of empirical evidence for the existence of substances as distinct from their properties, we nonetheless have the intuition that substances are required to explain qualitative unity."" (pp. 59)      To say that ""in the absence of empirical evidence"" is just to beg the question. but he goes on to say:      ""By hypothesis, color, shape, wetness, and mass tropes are compresent at a certain spatio- temporal location. This much both sides can agree on. Here is a possible explanation of the fact that we commonly take these to all be properties of a single thing, the water atom. When we wish to specify the location of this mass trope, it is easier to indicate it by using the term “water atom” than by indicating each of the three other tropes present at that location. This makes the communication process more efficient. It also relieves us of the burden of ascertaining just which other tropes are present at that location, given that we know from past experience that mass tropes are generally accompanied by other tropes in a certain range. “Water atom” functions as a convenient designator for a certain bundle of tropes (TS 832– 34; TSP ad TS 581– 83). That they make up a bundle has as much to do with us and our interests and cognitive limitations as it does with how things are in the   world. The world as it is anyway contributes the fact of their compresence. The rest— their being unified by their joint inherence in a substance— is our doing. The Buddhist doctrine of the two truths is their answer to the bundle theorist’s problem of unification.""      Basically, he uses their conventionalist position to ""explain"" how we construe substances from things that are nothing but tropes.

The problem of evil (or at least the logical version of the problem of evil that you keep harping on about), is a philosophical demonstration that the existence of evil is inconsistent with God’s attributes of goodness, omnipotence, etc. If Plato’s good work an argument provides a potential “out” then the argument in the problem of evil fails because the conclusion does not follow from the premises.      Notice how in the thousands of words that Dr. Feser has devoted to the topic of existential inertia, he has never once asked “where is the hard evidence for existential inertia?” Because it doesn’t matter if you have independent reasons to think such a thing exists. If the mere possibility of it’s existence is consistent with the metaphysical premises of the classical theists, then (most) cosmological arguments fail.      You’re allowed to think that such theodicies are super unsatisfying explanations, but stop pretending that “theists btfo with FACTS and LOGIC!!” Nobody is going to take you seriously when you overstate your case like that.",wcb philosophy blog philosophy logical demonstration qualify “ hard evidence ” go back matt dillihunty et al problem evil least logical version problem evil keep harping philosophical demonstration existence evil inconsistent attribute goodness omnipotence etc good work argument provides potential “ out ” argument problem evil fails conclusion follow premise notice thousand word dr feser devoted topic existential inertia never asked “ where hard evidence existential inertia ” matter independent reason think thing exists mere possibility existence consistent metaphysical premise classical theist cosmological argument fail allowed think theodicy super unsatisfying explanation stop pretending “ theist btfo fact logic ” nobody going take seriously overstate case like

If God had a better track record of making do on past atrocities, then we would be able to inductively reason, as many of us do with science, in this manner. The thing is, it looks like the bills for the Holocaust and slavery are overdue and all of us, living ~80 and ~450 years respectively, after these atrocities happened, cannot even begin to causally connect potential goods that God has deployed with the intention of paying this debt. Perhaps it is too much to expect God to pay that debt because those were human crimes; but I can also think of disasters, diseases, pandemics, mass extinctions, and other natural evils that are overdue and again, I am not sure what goods are intended to repay the extinctions of all of our hominid cousins, for example.",b begs question really different someone saying “ just wait see ” many people side died waiting seeing per schellenberg honestly sought divinity entire life came empty god better track record making past atrocity would able inductively reason many u science manner thing look like bill holocaust slavery overdue u living year respectively atrocity happened can not even begin causally connect potential good god deployed intention paying debt perhaps much expect god pay debt human crime also think disaster disease pandemic mass extinction natural evil overdue sure good intended repay extinction hominid cousin example

Basically, suppose that one sets up a 'suicide machine', in which, when a button is pressed, there is a 50% chance of some quantum event- an atomic decay say - causing effectively instantaneous death, so the subject would have no conscious indication should the decay occur. Following the 'many worlds' interpretation, when the subject presses the button the world will bifurcate into a 'region' where the decay has occurred and the subject is dead, and another where it did not and the subject is alive and well. Now the point is of course that there will be continuity of consciousness between worlds where the subject remains alive, so the subject will find that the suicide machine just will not work, no matter how many times the button is pressed or how many such machines or variations thereof are employed.

1068,theist,sceptic,"@ Don Jindra:       _Where are the pockets of stability?_      Those pockets of stability were what Darwin was hinting at with his gradualism. He knew that ""something"" is reining in matter. That's why he did not propose saltationism (Gould's ""hopeful monsters""). That's what we call ""species"". ""Species"" are a mean, and certain changes around it are allowed (accidental ones, like skin color, shape of the beaks, lenght of the legs, etc.) That's why monkeys don't give birth to humans or why ""crocoducks"" do not exist. Change is allowed, but NOT UNLIMITED CHANGE.

Evolution means just change, and for us, matter is ""hungry for change"". The world is in constant motion. But ""anything can be everything if you allow for enough time"" is a no-no for us. There are limits to change (imposed by the forms). There are restrictions imposed in Nature.

3290,theist,sceptic,"Sorry, I thought I had logged in under my name. I was the Anon of 2:29 above.      _It is / uses a theory that starts from the notion of surplus value and the workers' creation of surplus value._      Since both capitalism and socialism agree that there is surplus value that arrives on account of labor's input, neither _the surplus_ nor that it comes from _labor_ can be used to distinguish between the two economic model groups. What distinguishes them is that the socialist model insists that the means of production must not be privately owned:      _a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole._      While it is facially possible to speculate on models that provide for instances where factories (and other means of production) are owned by lower- down entities than **the whole community** , there are two problems: (1) the fundamental criterion here is that _there is no choice_ about whether the property is owned by ""the community"", the state mandates it and enforces it. So, while some community other than ""the state"" may be the nominal owner, because the state sets all of the criteria of what constitutes a sufficiently non-private entity, the state necessarily is embroiled in controlling the conditions of ""ownership"" on a vastly more intrusive level than in private property. This takes many of the elements of the ""bundle of rights"" that constitute ownership and puts them into the state's hands. Nominal ownership and actual control are not the same.      (2) Nobody has successfully articulated an actually _workable_ plan by which ""the workers"" can exercise control over production without very heavy intrusion of state authority. Even the most optimistic of ideas - which have never actually been implemented in an actual state - effectively would entail government regulation of ""boards"" and ""committees"" and ""councils"". Stanford Encyclopedia's description:      _Finally, and crucially, economic coordination would be based on comprehensive participatory planning. This would involve a complex system of nested worker councils, consumer councils, and an Iteration Facilitation Board. Various rounds of deliberation within, and between, worker and consumer councils, facilitated by this board, would be undertaken until matches between supply and demands schedules are found—with recourse to voting procedures only when no full agreement exists but several promising arrangements arise._      Anybody who knows the least bit of the history of the National Labor Relations Board knows that anyone relying on the above description without imagining intense government intrusion is wearing rose-colored glasses.      Regardless, my essential point is that it in socialism it is NOT an option for ""the workers"" to decide to distribute the means of production that may be ""under their control"" to individuals, and this constitutes a very grave limitation on their ""control"", such that it severely constrains a claim that ""the state doesn't own the means of production"". Yes, as long as you understand all the qualifiers that make that less than _simply_ true. The further constraint on property that has the state determine what constitutes a sufficiently large-scale ""means of production"" to require it ceasing to be ownable by an individual or a small group of individuals, and the typical mechanisms by which the state wrests control away from said individuals, also constitute reservations on what is meant by saying the state ""does not own"" the property. Under socialism, whatever community ""owns"" the property is, ultimately, shored up under a system of state constraints on said property that limits their choices in very important ways.

Moreover, a consistent Humean will have to take a much more modest view of natural science than contemporary atheists are wont to do – in part because of Hume’s attack on attempts to justify induction, and in part because the deliverances of modern physics are hardly less abstruse and remote from common life than the rationalist speculations he was so keen to shoot down.

Regarding his idealism, I would say that's probably the second best interpretation of quantum mechanics out there.

See above in the comments to this very post for examples of that line of thinking.      If you're a more thoughtful guy like Jones, you'll likely note that eliminativism is incoherent and invalidates all of our observations and all of our reasoning, and therefore cannot be true. Furthermore, you are likely to notice that our only knowledge of these increasingly tiny particles, and our only means of characterizing them, comes from utterly abstract mathematical equations that they seem to ""obey.""

In fact, Tomaszewski _explicitly_ says that DDS is _committed_ to the claim that _God is identical_ _to God’s act of creation_ : “DDS is directly committed only to (2), that is, to the identity of God and His act of creation” (p. 279). What Tomaszewski points out is that the classical theist is committed (and only committed) to denying that it is _necessarily true that_ God is identical to God’s act of creation. Tomaszewski explicitly says that DDS _is_ committed to God’s identity with God’s act of creation; it’s just that DDS must (to avoid modal collapse) hold that this claim is only _contingently true_. It is true in _some_ worlds but not in others. And it’s _contingently_ true because “God’s act of creation” only _non-rigidly_ designates God. It doesn’t pick out God in every possible world in which God exists. It only picks him out in _some_ worlds in which he exists. But it _does_ , indeed, pick him out in the actual world, and so—as Tomaszewski again explicitly says is a commitment of DDS—it is actually true that God is identical to his act of creation. What Tomaszewski (2019, p. 279) says begs the question is only the claim that _it is necessarily true that_ God is identical to God’s act of creation. _That_ is claim (2*) in Tomaszewski’s article, and _that_ is the claim that begs the question.

3831,theist,sceptic,"Vincent,   Jaegwon Kim, a prominent physicalist working on the mind-body problem concedes that the default position of human societies is not physicalism but dualism: “Something like this dualism of personhood, I believe, is common lore shared across most cultures and religious traditions.” (Mind in a Physical World: An Essay on the Mind-Body Problem and Mental Causation; Cambridge: MIT Press, 2000). Charles Taliaferro lists Michael Levin, Daniel Dennett, David Lewis, Thomas Nagel, J. J. C. Smart, Richard Rorty, Donald Davidson, and Colin McGinn as other non-dualist scholars working in philosophy of mind who concede that some commonsense view of dualism is held by the overwhelming number of humankind now and throughout history. Children are dualists. As Henry Wellman puts it, the recent findings of developmental psychology show that ""young children are dualists: knowledgeable of mental states and entities as ontologically different from physical objects"" (The Child's Theory of Mind; Cambridge: MIT Press, 1990). The presumption follows that Ancient Israel, like other ancient societies, would have held this commonsense dualism unless one can find evidence otherwise. What the Christian who claims that the Hebrew Bible advocates physicalism over dualism needs are arguments in the Hebrew Bible countering the prevailing assumption by ancient peoples of a basic dualism. There are none. The Hellenization thesis, as applied to physicalism, is a complete dud. Instead, basic dualism is at least the operating principle of the Hebrew Bible. And as bad as the position of Nancey Murphey, Brian Rosner, Paul Althaus and other Christian physicalists is, at least they are not global physicalists, i.e. they acknowledge that God is not composed of waves and limited to the speed of light.
