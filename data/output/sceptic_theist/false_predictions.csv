4871,sceptic,theist,"For whatever reason, atheists do not seem drawn to this argument. Perhaps it is because it focuses much too heavily on individual Christians. Even Draper jokes that he was going to include a picture of Jimmy Swaggart crying, but decided not to because it is a low blow. Technically speaking, even if we can establish that the MMFA is a non-fallacious _ad hominem_ , the argument seems to rest on the laurels of personal attacks on this or that believer. To circumvent this issue, I think a modified version of Draper’s argument is needed as a steel man. In fact, I think the modified argument results in what I call a logical handcuff, the proverbial rock and hard place. Theists will be damned if they do and damned if they don’t, as they say."

I am not presupposing Nagel. I am channeling Feser and Davies.      As Feser said once and I kept this quote.      ""you are mistakenly modeling divine knowledge as a kind of observation by which God learns what is happening in the world. That is not what it is at all, and God doesn't ""learn"" anything, not successively and not even in a single timeless act. Rather, God knows the world by virtue of knowing Himself as its cause. And what He causes is a world in which things happen successively. It doesn't follow that He knows it via some sort of succession of observations or the like. Nor does it follow that He is observing all moments of time at once. He is not observing it at all, any more than an author knows his novel by observing the characters and events in it.""END     "

848,theist,sceptic,"Vincent,   Jaegwon Kim, a prominent physicalist working on the mind-body problem concedes that the default position of human societies is not physicalism but dualism: “Something like this dualism of personhood, I believe, is common lore shared across most cultures and religious traditions.” (Mind in a Physical World: An Essay on the Mind-Body Problem and Mental Causation; Cambridge: MIT Press, 2000). Charles Taliaferro lists Michael Levin, Daniel Dennett, David Lewis, Thomas Nagel, J. J. C. Smart, Richard Rorty, Donald Davidson, and Colin McGinn as other non-dualist scholars working in philosophy of mind who concede that some commonsense view of dualism is held by the overwhelming number of humankind now and throughout history. Children are dualists. As Henry Wellman puts it, the recent findings of developmental psychology show that ""young children are dualists: knowledgeable of mental states and entities as ontologically different from physical objects"" (The Child's Theory of Mind; Cambridge: MIT Press, 1990). The presumption follows that Ancient Israel, like other ancient societies, would have held this commonsense dualism unless one can find evidence otherwise. What the Christian who claims that the Hebrew Bible advocates physicalism over dualism needs are arguments in the Hebrew Bible countering the prevailing assumption by ancient peoples of a basic dualism. There are none. The Hellenization thesis, as applied to physicalism, is a complete dud. Instead, basic dualism is at least the operating principle of the Hebrew Bible. And as bad as the position of Nancey Murphey, Brian Rosner, Paul Althaus and other Christian physicalists is, at least they are not global physicalists, i.e. they acknowledge that God is not composed of waves and limited to the speed of light.   The Hellenization thesis is discredited with regards to doctrines like divine impassibility (Paul Gavrilyuk and several others show this) but it is even more discredited with respect to the Ancient Israelites were physicalists stuff."

Every activity reduces to a change in what is present” (Ibid.). The Neo- Aristotelian is off track to say we have _power_ to bake a cake and that the oven has _power_ to yield this desired outcome that do not trace back to its parts or as Cartwright states of general nomological machines: “We explicate how the machine arrangement dictates what can happen – it has emergent powers which are not to be found in its components” (Cartwright, Nancy & Pemberton, John (2013). Aristotelian powers: without them, what would modern science do? In John Greco & Ruth Groff (eds.), _Powers and Capacities in Philosophy: the New Aristotelianism_. London, U.K.: Routledge. pp. 93-112.). Of the nomological machines in nature, Cartwright appears to bypass the role of evolution. Of such machines invented by humans, she ignores the fact that we often wrongly predict what a given invention will do. Evolution proceeds via probabilities and so, from our _ad hoc_ point of view, it looks very much like trial and error. Humans have the advantage of being much more deliberate about what they are _selecting_ for and therefore, our testing and re-testing of inventions and deciding when they are safe and suitable to hit the market is markedly similar to evolutionary selection."

5041,theist,sceptic,"I'm ""self-banned"" from commenting on Feser's blog.

Since it becomes true, it seems to me there is a change and/or succession in God's intellect (in God, therefore). This suggests to me that even if I (a layman, mind you) can't pinpoint exactly what goes wrong in Thomist arguments, there must be something wrong at the root of it.

Aristotle essentially founded the scientific study of biology. He got a lot right, more than anyone else up to his time had. Spontaneous generation was not a harebrained scheme aristotle came up with one afternoon. It was the science of his day (young children couldn't ""figure it out"" like you say, and they don't figure it out today. They are told why flies appear around dead meat by adults and believe it. They aren't running empirical experiments). The idea long predates him. And it survived after him. The theory wasn't decisively refuted until the time of Pasteur.

The various changes in creation would be explained by reference to God’s creating and sustaining activity, and God’s _own_ passive potencies could be actualized by God _qua agent cause_. Agents actualize their own passive potentialities all the time—for instance, assuming agent-causal views in the metaphysics of action, I actualize my own passive potency to form intentions. (This doesn’t involve the passive potency _itself_ pulling itself into actuality by its own bootstraps, of course.) God, here, is quite clearly a first cause, and yet he has passive potencies.

1505,theist,sceptic,"(Continuation)      So not just it's unfair and wrong to say that ""this usage is common to Aristotle"" but one thing that I noticed in the book of both authors is the somewhat intentional sidestep or ""shell game"" of problems - like they were trying intentionally guide the book in a way to evade potential questions to their points. To be fair, Siderits tried to address some points of that (I do recommend the reading of the Chapter 4 since the most relevant discussion of points that could be related to our philosophy concentrates there). But his position simply gives me the impression that he tries to misplace the substance into its parts (like a shell game) and then comes to the conclusion that the substance could not exist. In responding to how accidents are always found in the substances (he does not use the term accidents, I'm using it to simplify) if they do not exist, he says:      ""Consider the water atom as an allegedly indivisible substance in which inhere the qualities of color, shape, wetness and mass. Resistance to the notion that these qualities may be thought of as its parts comes from the intuition that qualities do not simply float freely in the air, that they must be tethered to something that then explains their occurrence together with other qualities. Bundle theorists are typically asked to provide the principle of qualitative unity that would explain the co- occurrence of many qualities in the absence of a substance in which they inhere. The Buddhist bundle theorist says this is the wrong question to be asking. Instead we should ask why, in the absence of empirical evidence for the existence of substances as distinct from their properties, we nonetheless have the intuition that substances are required to explain qualitative unity."" (pp. 59)      To say that ""in the absence of empirical evidence"" is just to beg the question. but he goes on to say:      ""By hypothesis, color, shape, wetness, and mass tropes are compresent at a certain spatio- temporal location. This much both sides can agree on. Here is a possible explanation of the fact that we commonly take these to all be properties of a single thing, the water atom. When we wish to specify the location of this mass trope, it is easier to indicate it by using the term “water atom” than by indicating each of the three other tropes present at that location. This makes the communication process more efficient. It also relieves us of the burden of ascertaining just which other tropes are present at that location, given that we know from past experience that mass tropes are generally accompanied by other tropes in a certain range. “Water atom” functions as a convenient designator for a certain bundle of tropes (TS 832– 34; TSP ad TS 581– 83). That they make up a bundle has as much to do with us and our interests and cognitive limitations as it does with how things are in the   world. The world as it is anyway contributes the fact of their compresence. The rest— their being unified by their joint inherence in a substance— is our doing. The Buddhist doctrine of the two truths is their answer to the bundle theorist’s problem of unification.""      Basically, he uses their conventionalist position to ""explain"" how we construe substances from things that are nothing but tropes.      (I will continue)  "

3733,sceptic,theist,"Anyway, I also seem to recall Aquinas explicitly saying that God’s act of creation is intrinsic to God, and identical to God. In which case, that is the exact opposite of a Cambridge property which is an extrinsic relation that is outside of God. Aquinas says, “God does not act by an action that is outside Him, as though it went out from Him and terminated in a creature.”[24] According to Aquinas, “The manifold actions ascribed to God, like intelligence, volition, _the production of things_ , and the like, are not so many different things, since each of these actions in God is His very being, which is one and the same thing.”[25] For some reason I thought Aquinas said that. But who knows? Maybe Aquinas never said any of that. Maybe Feser is right to say something that directly contradicts what Aquinas explicitly says. Perhaps that is what it means to be a Thomist.

37,theist,sceptic,"(last one)      But at the same time, there is a problem with me I couldn't help but think that what if I got them all wrong? What if their arguments are plausible at all? I'm not a philosopher, just a normal guy. And I want to confess something: even though I do not think that something like that (buddhism) is plausible at all, I am afraid of the possibility that it could be because I am ignorant and my OCD does not let me go through this. It was a lot hard to write all these comments - since I am struggling with myself to even conclude a thought. There were a lot more - and a lot more detailed criticism - that I want to write but I simply can't (especially a topic at 4.5 that's the most important part of all it but I don't have the necessary strength and a point that I tried to make à-la Aristotelian retortion in the sense that they must presuppose permanence and can't get rid of it in making their arguments in the same way that Alex Rosenberg can't get rid of intentionality when trying to 'naturalize intentionality').      And for those of you who think: ""why buddhism bothers you that much?"" The answer should be self-evident by now (and for reasons that make simple materialism looks like a weekend at the beach): look at the consequences of all that. There would be no persons, no things, and in some way just suffering. Life would be just horrible. There would be illusions all around us. All persons would be substances per accident - and that's just awful and I can't believe that there are people who find this idea pleasing. And the other reason is OCD. Looks like nothing that I could present by myself is ever sufficient to disprove them. Looks like my arguments are never enough - and since I'm just illiterate in philosophy there is a wall I could never cross.      Unfortunately, I came across buddhism by chance when I was fixated on the experiment of Benjamin Libet on free will (at least his sense of ""free will"") and stumbled across the work of Sam Harris arguing that since there was no free will there is the illusion of the self. Since I have OCD things don't 'go out' of my head that easily (like in the case of normal people). Since the idea per se is insane I tried to understand why people think that it's plausible in the first place. And by their paradoxical 'reductio' way of arguing and the abuse of science that they always propose (bearing in mind that I didn't know that there is such a thing as A-T Meta at the time) that stuck in my head and only got worse through the years.      So, I appreciate it if someone could help me with it. Even though it's not apparent, I tried to put a lot of effort into solving it. But I simply can't take it anymore and just reading something from that topic just brings me a lot of pain."

2908,theist,sceptic,"I've only just started reviewing but I think his intuition is sound. The puzzle raised by modal collapse arguments is how a simple God can be intrinsically the same across different possible worlds (worlds with different creations or no creations at all). Yet, if you accept that God's essence is necessary, as most theistic critics of divine simplicity do, Tomaszewski shows that you have the same problem: the non-simple God's necessary essence is the same across all possible worlds, including any intrinsic, contingent properties of God. But those intrinsic properties are grounded in God's necessary essence and thus are themselves necessary. In other words, you get the same ""modal collapse,"" except that what collapses is not only creation but God himself. At least, this is my very crude rendition of the argument.      So, the burden on the theistic personalist (such as Ryan Mullins) is to explain: If you contend that God's essence is necessary, how do you account for the contingency of those properties that are grounded in God's essence? And, if you can offer such an account, why can't the same apply to a simple God?      Perhaps the theistic personalist can respond: God's contingent properties are not grounded in His essence; rather, they are not grounded in anything at all. God is a composite of a necessary essence and various contingent properties; the act of creation arises from one of those contingent properties.      Tomaszewski doesn't say this but I think the same issue applies to a naturalist who believes there is a necessary, natural foundation to reality (I think this is Oppy's view). Except that the naturalist can argue that the necessary foundation creates through an entirely random, non-deterministic process -- which is not an option open for any traditional theist."

47,sceptic,theist,"One might think that the number two has a passive potency for existence that requires being actualized by something else—perhaps a necessary intellect, or perhaps by the number one together with the successor function. But, first, the focus on the number two is inessential; we need simply pick an abstract object lying at the bottom layer of some grounding hierarchy relating abstracta. This, of course, doesn’t rule out a necessary intellect that actualizes such an object; but the onus is not on _me_ , in the present context, to positively show that this is _false_ ; the onus is on the one _positively claiming_ that composition entails passive potency to show that _any composite_ —including such an abstract object at the bottom level of the abstract grounding hierarchy—has passive potency. “But doesn’t Feser do precisely that in his Augustinian proof?”, you ask. “Well,” I respond, “for starters, he only argues that abstracta exist as divine ideas. This doesn’t entail that abstracta have passive potencies that are _actualized_ by the necessary intellect. But _even if_ Feser were correctly interpreted as attempting to establish this, Feser’s attempt is only that — an _attempt_. But as I explain in my forthcoming _Springer_ book, his attempt fails. I also explain this in [my lecture video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REgU-84fQU8) and, partly, in my post [here](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/06/04/fesers-insuperable- arguments-against-platonism/).” But also: this move isn’t open to the classical theist. For under this theistic conceptualist view, the number two is intrinsic to God. Hence, if the number two has passive potency, then there is passive potency within God. But God, _qua_ purely actual, is altogether devoid of passive potency within him."

This is hardly the kind of “proof” that any reasonable person could use and still come to your conclusions.

Even granting that experimental knowledge is required for omniscience, I don't think this follows. If I have ridden a bike in the past, but then am injured so that I can't ride any more, it doesn't seem like I would lose the knowledge of riding just because I lost the capacity. So it seems like at the very least we need to add some qualifiers there if we want to infer knowledge about riding bikes from our ability to do so."
3475,sceptic,theist,"[16] In short, detractors of the Aristotelian proof **_don’t need_** to _positively_ justify or establish that what happened prior to t _is_ sufficient to explain the water’s existence at t.

1558,sceptic,theist,"In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 = .000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though, if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero."

1210,theist,sceptic,"In Dr. Feser's twitter account there was a response to the original tweets that I think captures what seems to me a very obvious problem with this criticism of Meyer. Jonathan wrote: ""I don’t think the point of these arguments is to make God contingent, but to argue for his existence probabilistically. I don’t see an issue with arguing for a metaphysically necessary being with abduction."" To object to this is to say that a contingent argument necessarily entails that the being argued for is contingent. That seems to me quite obviously false. It is the argument that is being characterized as contingent and this does not tell us that the being argued for is either contingent or necessary.      Dr. Feser responded to this tweet saying: ""I know they don't intend to make God contingent. But if an argument leaves it even possible that the world might exist apart from X, then to establish X isn't to establish God (Note that that doesn't entail that X is not God, but only that the arg doesn't establish that X is God)"" My response to this is that their aim is not to ""establish"" God (i.e. the God of Classical Theism who is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob). ID folks are very explicit about this. Their goal is not a scholastic demonstration. After all their arguments are contingent and proceed by way of abduction following the work of Pierce. That this approach does not get us all the way to classical theism and the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob seems to me no grounds for criticizing it as though it accomplishes nothing.      This appears to me like an older brother who is an exceptional and developed artist criticizing his younger brother for making initial efforts at art because those efforts are not as precise and clear. What would be the point of such an attack? It would certainly seem to me unnecessarily discouraging to the younger brother especially when the two approaches are not mutually exclusive.      The point I am making is consistent with Wuellner's definition: ""a conditional or provisional explanation of observed facts or of their connection with each other"". This can be taken in two ways. It can either entail that the existence of the thing that explains the phenomena is contingent and that its relationship to the thing caused is contingent *OR* it could mean that the explanation qua explanation is contingent (i.e. a contingent argument). Is it not entirely consistent with classical theism to recognize the latter possibility with abduction? It is not obvious to me why not.      It seems that Dr. Feser's answer to this is that an abductive approach can only show causal links that are themselves contingent (""because the causal relationship between them, even if real, is going to be contingent."") It is not clear to me why Dr. Feser thinks it is the case that contingent arguments entail that the being argued for is itself contingent and this seems to me to get at the crux of the issue."
2299,sceptic,theist,"This could lead to one of two different conclusions. It might mean that the Jewish Scriptures and the majority of Muslims are implicitly affirming atheism because they deny divine simplicity. Alternatively, it might mean that neoclassical theism is a very old, and well-established position within the history of Western philosophical theology. I’ll let you decide which is the correct conclusion."
318,theist,sceptic," _The ""form"" is not an illusion in the sense that it doesn't exist at all, it is an illusion because it doesn't exist as a somehow semi-independent quality._      The problem is that this really doesn't solve the problem; other than a chair, the problems of reducing the function of sensory organs to mere arrangements is more apparent. But that should be there minor quibble here. (It should be said though that the chair in itself has ascribed properties it mere parts lack, e.g. its shape, which makes the mereological nihilism you're hinting at quite implausible. Ever the more so for a biological organ)      More importantly, the goal should be to undermine skepticism. And this is actually only possible if we suppose that a function is fulfilled here. An eyeball displaying illusions is only wrong (wrong as the normative judgment that it's not doing its job) insofar as there is an objectively correct mode of observation that the eyeball in question is incapable to represent. That is only something a form with a corresponding final cause is able to sustain. In either the atomist or the monist worldview, this idea has no room, since the arrangement is always only shape-wise, an imitation instead of a real member. If we take the two options seriously we have no reason to assume the observed data we're witnessing is actually reality representing.      Of course we can't guarantee that with the Aristotelian conception either, after all they could malfunction right now. But the point is, similar to the debate about causation of contingent events, which worldview actually allows us rationally to employ phenomenal conservatism, and that's just what Koons describes here.      Side note, purpose doesn't necessarily mean purposefully shaped or done that way, but also can refer to functions and usability. In that sense, the razor shaped stone can absolutely be directed towards one of its purposes (final causes) through using it as a razor."

68,theist,sceptic,"(Continuation)      It's important to note though that ""Dharmas are just tropes"" and for them ""The ultimate ontology consists entirely of tropes. But these, together with the facts about human interests and cognitive limitations, explain the more familiar world populated by persisting composite substances with their various properties. Among the substances in this more familiar world are things that we also call water atoms. But these, it turns out, are a many masquerading as a one"" (pp. 60). And if it was any doubt left between humean bundle theory and buddhist position I think this will suffice.      Siderits then brings up this purported answer to the problem of ""smuggling substance back in"": ""One might wonder whether the Buddhist reductionist is entitled to bring facts about human persons into their explanation, given that humans are themselves substances. But these substances are, they will reply, reducible to systems consisting of bundles of tropes behaving in accordance with causal laws. Among the behaviors explained by the relevant causal laws are the use of convenient designators by such systems. So the reductive explanation of the intuitions behind the posit of substances does not illegitimately smuggle substances into the explanans.""      And this brings yet another problem with them: the handwaving appeal to ""sciences"". It's not hard to find these guys arguing that there are ""stone- wise arranged atoms"" or that natural selection somehow vindicates the idea of impermanence (Garfield appeals a lot more for these kinds of things, that's why I'm not using his work that much). But that does not seem right, because that turns your metaphysics hostage to the scientific findings - the same findings that may overthrow your own view.      But if we come to focus on other points like their appeal to nominalism, they suffer from the same problems that Ed emphasized in TLS and Scholastics meta. The points like how they can even communicate with themselves if there are no universals - or even worse if there are just ""momentary beings"". But I think that their denial of universals has some relation with their momentariness thesis. And that's what I can't even understand in the first place. How can someone think that something analogous to the Heraclitean position is right in the first place? It's illogical. And someone might even say that, correctly, that the ""buddhist logic"" is very different from ""Aristotelian logic"". Fair enough. But that doesn't explain why someone might think that something so absurd as ""impermanent beings"" (let alone mereological nihilism, nominalism) is plausible in the first place. To affirm that ""there are no pots that last longer than a moment"" and that ""there is just a series of ephemeral pots one after another"" is not to disprove permanence, but to evade the problem altogether.

1189,theist,sceptic,"Note that the implication of operationalism here is not just that we can _know_ someone is angry by way of observing his behavior. It is that there is _nothing more to_ anger than the behavior. Now, one problem with this claim is that it simply isn’t true. A person could be angry without exhibiting the usual behavioral signs of anger, and could also exhibit those signs without actually being angry. Hence anger is something more than the behavior. Another problem is that it turns out even apart from that to be impossible entirely to analyze anger or any other mental state in entirely behavioral terms. Suppose we say that “John is angry” means “John is disposed to raise his voice, frown, stomp his feet, etc.” The trouble is that this sentence will be true only if John does not desire to hide his feelings. But if we add a reference to the absence of this desire to our definition, we’ve now got a further mentalistic concept – desire – that needs to be given a behaviorist analysis. And it turns out that to carry out such an analysis, we need to make reference to yet _further_ mental states, with _those_ now needing a behaviorist analysis, and so on _ad infinitum_. Hence the operationalist analysis cannot actually be carried out."

5538,sceptic,theist,"Tangentially, it can be granted that a weak pluralism should be allowed if only because foundationalist axioms can apply to logical and mathematical theorems. There are pure or abstract logical and mathematical theorems that have no correspondence to reality and as such, correspondence theory of truth has limits. For example, when doing mathematical proofs, there are multiples sets N (the set of natural numbers), Z ( the set of integers), Q (the set of rational numbers), and R (the set of real numbers); there are also D (the set of decimals) and C (the set of complex numbers), which are less common in proofs. One may come across a statement that reads “n ∈ Z,” which states that n is an element within the set of integers. More specifically, one might be asked to prove the statement “∀n ∈ Z . n(n + 1) is even.” This can be done by assuming that some natural number n is either odd or even. Upon making n = 2m, one will find that 2(m(n+1) and 2(nm) are both even, which proves the statement. This mathematical proof does not rely on tangible reality in the way someone may point to a polar bear on television to prove that the proposition “polar bears are white” is true. There are also properties in mathematics that are true by definition, i.e., _a priori_ , e.g., zero product property, associative property. In logic, the laws of logic are also generally considered to be axiomatic."

The tendency, however, to leap from the possibility of knowing every truth to someone knowing every truth is dubious. It is similar to the leap rooted in Anselm: conceivability implies possibility. Worse still is that Pruss leaps from possibility to actuality. One should not draw ontological conclusions on the basis of logical considerations."
1476,theist,sceptic,"Vincent, at the risk of being a scold, you should really know better than to throw out some of these criticisms, most of which are either misunderstandings or irrelevancies. You've been around here long enough to be able to get the picture:      1) Parts stand in potential to the whole qua substance. The whole stands in potential to the parts qua composite. The claim is not that the whole is prior to the part in literally every respect. So of course the Thomist can have both statements, because the statements aren't claiming incompatible things.      2) Who knows whether nebulae, galaxies, etc. are substances? My suspicion is no, but that the question is a difficult one to answer as a matter of fact shouldn't much be surprising. Nothing about hylomorphism says it must be easy to discern what is a substance and what is not.      3) Koons explicitly rejects the idea that particles are fundamental, so this is a moot point.      4) For heaven's sake, not this objection of ""Aristotle's science held different conclusions and paradigms from contemporary science"" again. We know. But this is not what Koons is setting out to defend. You assert that QM does nothing to support a hylomorphic philosophy of nature and then go on to speak about, not matter and form, but certain niceties of Aristotle's account of accidents (i.e. place, relation, position/posture, etc.) which don't directly bear on hylomorphism at all."

1360,sceptic,theist,"For example, on Armstrong’s version, the nomic regularity that _all Fs are Gs_ is explained by the truth of the statement that N(F, G), where N is a sui generis relation between the universals F and G. [Here’s something that I just learned about Armstrong’s account: for Armstrong, universals are _parts_ of states of affairs and states of affairs are concreta. So, while we could conceive of a view where the necessitation relation is a relation between abstracta, that’s not how Armstrong’s view works. Apparently, Armstrong discusses this issue in his book _A World of States of Affairs_.]"
4956,theist,sceptic,"""Please explain how coitus and miscarriages are ""the work of God"" and how it's possible for man to prevent Almighty God from working.""      According to Ed Feser, nothing would exist for even an instant if God did not actively sustain it.   So, miscarriages are the work of God. The only things that might be considered not the work of God would be libertarian free willed decisions.      And if Almighty God exists, man can't prevent Him from working, whether he works through miscarriages or abortions, if He wants an unborn baby to die, it dies. But that's all there is to it.   Why is it a abortion considered a grave evil. it is simply what God wants.      And as for the distinction between God willing X and God permitting X and a distinction between X being the work of God and X being permitted by God, there can be no such distinction is it's true that nothing would exist for even an instant if God did not actively sustain it.   Anybody who holds that view and still argues for the distinction is simply contradicting himself. So, his view is not internally coherent."

2337,sceptic,theist,"Rundle (2004, pp. 88-92) holds that persistence is not itself a change and concludes, on that basis, that no continuously operative sustaining cause is needed to explain it. Thus, Rundle writes: “When, we may ask, is a sustaining cause needed? Most obviously, when there is a disintegrating factor to be countered or inhibited, as when a structure will collapse unless it is supported. However, if there is no such threat there is no such need” ( _ibid_ , p. 88). He continues:"

To me, that’s one of those synonyms I expressed concern about above. I’ll give you my (reductive) answer. I think they’re categorizing conclusions, along with the blizzard of associated dispositions and predictions that fire when a stimulus comes in. I’m guessing you don’t think that covers it.

4988,sceptic,theist,"Wilson makes another good point about “ethically relevant features” of a situation: “Faced with people who don’t ‘get’ a thought experiment, the temptation for philosophers is to say that these people aren’t sufficiently good at isolating what is ethically relevant. Obviously, such a response risks being self-serving, and tends to gloss over an important question: how should we determine what are the ethically relevant features of a situation? Why, for example, should a philosopher sitting in an armchair be in a better position to determine the ethically relevant features of ‘The Violinist’ than someone who’s worked with thousands of patients?”"

305,sceptic,theist,"_A priori_ arguments fall in the purview of deductive atheology. Such atheists would argue that the traditional view of God is incoherent. Such a God is not possible on this view. The characteristics God purportedly has are contradictory either in and of themselves or when one attempts to reconcile them. Take for example J.L Mackie’s explication of the Omnipotence Paradox: “can an omnipotent being make things which he cannot subsequently control? Or, what is practically equivalent to this, can an omnipotent being make rules which then bind himself?” (Mackie, J. L. 1955. Evil and omnipotence. _Mind_ 64 (254): 200-212. Available on [web](https://href.li/?http://www.ditext.com/mackie/evil.html).). This is a more generalized version of the Omnipotence Paradox, which usually asks: can God create a stone he cannot lift? Therefore, the paradox can be viewed as an argument attempting to show that omnipotence is incoherent in and of itself. The argument attempts to accomplish this by dividing omnipotence into two components, which I call _functional_ and _physical_. Functional omnipotence is the capacity to _will_ anything whilst physical omnipotence is the capacity to _do_ anything. Therefore, the argument attempts to show that it is possible that God could will something he cannot do, in Mackie’s case, will something that he cannot control or in the general case, will the existence of a stone so heavy that he cannot complete the particular task of lifting it."

3975,sceptic,theist,"One might now say that some of these arguments sound suspiciously pro-life. Well, the question has never been whether someone who is pro-choice values human life. The question has always been whether a fetus’ hypothetical rights override the rights of living, breathing people, specifically the mother and her extant family. The question has always been about whether it is my place to interfere with a woman’s decision to have an abortion. My resolve to not interfere in these decisions does not mean I do not value human life at all. Furthermore, my resolve is informed by the fact that forcing women to bring children into poverty or into a household in where domestic violence is a regular occurrence results in a vicious cycle that benefits parties fully intent on exploiting the poor. There is a reason why the more affluent and educated have significantly less abortions."

111,theist,sceptic,"@ Vincent Torley,      Particles that are bound are in a different state than ""free floating"" particles. In a living body the state of these particles is a complicated superposition of orthoganal functions of position and time. The eigenfunctions of their states are similarly local and complicated since potentials themselves vary in a complicated way inside a living body, and they certainly change when the body no longer functions, as in death, when neurons, muscle cells, etc., are no longer transmitting and conducting action potentials. Whether a physicist does or does not believe that there is such a thing as death, i.e. whether or not anything changes is not relevant to the truth ( it is absurd to think that nothing changes). Hylemorphism is not inconsistent with radical state change of the wave function of the entire body with death.      Furthermore, the study of brain states with various types of probes disturbs the states and causes them to be different than they would be while private, according to quantum mechanics, so attempting to understand a free mind by probing brain states is bound to be beset with difficulties. Let's whack the golf ball off the tee and then study the tee to see what we can learn of the golf ball.      :-)      You seem to be involved in circular justification of your arbitrary prejudices here. I see no reason to take them seriously here.      Happy New Year,      Tom Cohoe  "

I should add, however, that such a limitation doesn't stop them from talking about such unread works with the strongest opinions.      Some books are even written for such people. They have whole sections that can be comfortably skipped."
