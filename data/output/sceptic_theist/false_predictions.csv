621,theist,sceptic,"@Walter      Or both views could have existed together. Anyway, classical theism won that day and got to massively influence western philosophy and theology for centuries, so it is the classical one, my man.      And perhaps some gnostics did believe in divine simplicity, you know. St. Irenaeus problem was with they making intellect a emanation, but Plotinus did the same thing latter precisely thanks to divine simplicity, so it could have motivated some of they as well.      @RunDec      I see. That is a interesting view that do take a perspective accepted by a lot of classical theists for granted and does seems to account for Quentin Smith problem with Boethius account of divine foreknowledge.      It take a thing or too that i'am going to reject on the analytical take on thomistic divine simplicity, but it is a good view. Wonder how people commited to the premises you use would respond."

1737,sceptic,theist,"(1) I don’t see why one hypothesis, in the case you described, should be preferred over another, if indeed they are the same with respect to simplicity, modesty, and any other factor that determines intrinsic probability. They both seem to explain the data equally well, and so — given your stipulations — I don’t see why we shouldn’t just remain agnostic on which is true. I don’t (yet) see the need for a tie-breaker."
168,theist,sceptic,"Now, I assume that Hart accepts this distinction. If he does, though, then he should realize that his argument does not succeed, because the position he rejects does not entail attributing any passive potential in God (which would indeed be problematic) but rather only active potency. And if he does not accept the distinction, then his argument simply begs the question against his critics, who do accept it."
1813,sceptic,theist,"[8] Note that this is a stipulative definition of ‘destruction’. We recognize that it may sound odd to call it ‘destruction’. (Then again, lots of our ordinary concepts sound odd when adapted or applied to perdurantism.) What matters for present purposes is that we have a clear and precise definition of the relevant concept. If the reader still demurs at our usage, simply replace the word with another, more fitting one."
485,theist,sceptic,A Kindle Fire running a pre-release version of my [Giant Stopwatch](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=omegacentauri.mobi.simplestopwatch&hl=en_US&gl=US) app provided unofficial timing for audience to see and for my pacing. I had to modify the app to have a periodic beep to meet Guinness's requirements of an audible stop signal.
538,sceptic,theist,"From page 300 in Buckley’s 1987: “Clarke’s first three theorems demonstrate three successive predicates about reality. There is a being that is (1) eternal, (2) immutable and independent, and (3) self-existent or necessary. D’Holbach concurs in these attributes, but counters that they inhere in nature or matter. Clarke is right about his predicates; he is wrong about their subject.” Page 301: “That matter is necessary, that is, indestructible, becomes the ground for asserting that it is eternal.”"
1841,sceptic,theist,"The point is just that what has been said here about ordinary physical parts like chair legs and screws would be true also of metaphysical parts like form and matter, if they exist. … For on the Aristotelian analysis, the form of something like copper or a tree is, all by itself and apart from matter, a mere abstraction rather than a concrete object. … But matter all by itself and apart from any form is, for the Aristotelian, nothing but the _potential_ to be something. It is only _actually_ some thing if it has the form of some particular kind of thing. So, though form and matter are different, there is a sense in which form depends on matter and matter depends on form. We would thus have an explanatory vicious circle if there were not something outside them which accounted for their combination. (2017, p. 73)"

1091,theist,sceptic,"Hello, Dr. Pruss. It seems like you used a lot of ideas in your blog for this lecture!   I have a few questions. First, how is your book going? I saw you haven't updated it in a while. Have you seen Joe Schmid's new book that is coming out? It's about classical theism and existential inertia. I know you have a paper about divine conservation coming up, so I would like to hear some arguments against existential inertia. Moreover, there is a book with an essay by you in it: Classical Theism by Routledge. In it, you argue for divine simplicity. Can you tell me about some arguments in it?   https://www.amazon.com/Existential-Inertia-Classical-Theistic- Proofs/dp/3031193121/"
1351,sceptic,theist,"[4] Once more, the same reply can be offered with a _non-theistic_ necessary foundation _mutatis mutandis_."
1111,sceptic,theist,"Alternatively, one might notice that I have been offering a criticism of classical theism. I have never been particularly interested in critiquing Thomism like Feser wants me to. Why? Because Aquinas’s disciples have created a million different schools of Thomism, and I have never been fussed about trying to sort through them all. This is mainly because these disciples start with an assumption that I cannot accept, and then interpret Aquinas accordingly. This is how disciples of Aquinas work. First, they start with the assumption that Aquinas cannot possibly be wrong about anything, and that he is never inconsistent with himself. Second, from this assumption, they will engage in all sorts of wild interpretative strategies to make Aquinas infallible. I just don’t have enough faith to be a fellow disciple."
1746,sceptic,theist,These responses also take care of Gel’s ensuing discussion involving pine trees and whatnot.
771,theist,sceptic,"I suppose the main worry with this argument is that perhaps only an ought governing voluntary activity implies can. But the epistemic life is in large part involuntary. An eye ought to transmit visual information, but some eyes cannot—and that is not a problem because seeing is involuntary."
1575,sceptic,theist,"Thanks for the comment! I must be brief, as my grad app deadlines are fast approaching."
1730,sceptic,theist,"I find this odd. Notice that the doctrine only seems incoherent because I have mischaracterized it. I’ve seen this strategy before. I have constantly put up with Thomists claiming that the only reason one might disagree with the great and infallible Aquinas is because they have misunderstood Aquinas. Norman Geisler used to do this all the time, and things have not really changed much since then."
1034,sceptic,theist,There are two troubles with this argument.[14] As the problems appear in my book:
1247,sceptic,theist,"Suppose the principle is true. Now go to a possible world in which God refrains from creating (assume, as traditional theism does, that God has leeway freedom in creating). In that world, there are contingent things uncreated by God (namely, absences of creatures). But according to traditional theism's aseity-sovereignty doctrine, there can be no contingent things that are not created by God. Therefore, traditional theism is false."

1785,sceptic,theist,"Would Dr Feser appreciate being labelled an “internet classical theist” (as the word “other” implies)? Yes, he’s pretty prominent on the internet (for a field like his, anyway), but the description seems to be needlessly demeaning."
205,sceptic,theist,"As for the main point at issue, I do think that the snark is unnecessary and detracts from the overall quality of the discussion. I think coming out of the gate with such an aggressively combative tone can really frustrate the task of truth-seeking (and does not allow a genuine meeting of minds). But that’s just my two cents."
1577,theist,sceptic,"When the Scholastics deny potency in God, they mean God has no passive potencies. It’s impossible for God to acquire any new perfections. These are distinct from what active potencies, which might also be called causal powers. God has all causal powers —and so is omnipotent—, and therefore is capable of creating all possible beings, not merely those beings that have, do, or will exist in this world.      Parádoxo"
1741,sceptic,theist,"This follows from the _factivity of knowledge_. Knowledge is factive—in other words, one can only know that p is true if p is, in fact, true. It cannot be the case that one knows p but p is false. E.g., It’s true that 1+1 is 2, and so it makes no sense to say that I _know_ 1+1 _isn’t_ 2."
1334,sceptic,theist,"The evidence for fine-tuning confirms both demiurgism and panentheism over theism, and in this way is good evidence against theism. This is because the intuitive and empirical evidence against creation _ex nihilo_ creates a strong drag on theism’s prior probability not suffered by demiurgism and panentheism, and so they lap the former in terms of posterior probability. _A fortiori_ , the posterior probability of the inclusive disjunction of demiurgism and panentheism is considerably higher than that of theism given the evidence of fine-tuning."
1001,sceptic,theist,"[I]n order for the chair to remain red at t + ε, the chemical microstructure of the chair will have to continue being in a certain way. If the microchemical structure of the chair were different, the chair would no longer be red. So, it isn’t the case that the red chair can remain red at t + ε as long as nothing intervenes. Rather… in order to retain ‘the redness,’ something outside of ‘the redness’ needs to be in place. (2020, p. 7)"
861,theist,sceptic,RunDec      I am okey with you not being confidenr but please don't tell me what I should or should not do.
1173,theist,sceptic,"Now, someone might also object that an argument need not get you _all_ the way to God to get you _part_ of the way. And that is perfectly true. Suppose, for example, that some version of the argument from contingency (such as those defended by Avicenna, Aquinas, and Leibniz) really does demonstrate the existence of an absolutely necessary being. That would certainly do much to establish classical theism, even if one did not go on to show that this necessary being had further divine attributes such as omnipotence and omniscience. For necessity itself is one of the divine attributes, which radically differentiates God from everything else, so that to establish that something exists of necessity is a crucial step on the way to a complete argument for theism."
1228,theist,sceptic,Hi Ficino! All is well. Great to see you. I really miss the old days on the classical theism forum. I'm thinking of starting another classical theism community--just wondering if Ed would be okay with me shamelessly plugging it in the com boxes here from time to time.
1885,theist,sceptic,"It would be interesting if WBC was actually commenting on anything Feser _actually_ said, instead of just making up accusations. They aren't really even interesting ones, either. His stuff is a waste of space."
1058,theist,sceptic,"First, what's so mysterious about potencies that makes your account of change more reasonable?      Second, why is the fact that every potency is grounded in some actuality evidence in favor of your account of change?"
1474,theist,sceptic,"(Continuation)      So not just it's unfair and wrong to say that ""this usage is common to Aristotle"" but one thing that I noticed in the book of both authors is the somewhat intentional sidestep or ""shell game"" of problems - like they were trying intentionally guide the book in a way to evade potential questions to their points. To be fair, Siderits tried to address some points of that (I do recommend the reading of the Chapter 4 since the most relevant discussion of points that could be related to our philosophy concentrates there). But his position simply gives me the impression that he tries to misplace the substance into its parts (like a shell game) and then comes to the conclusion that the substance could not exist. In responding to how accidents are always found in the substances (he does not use the term accidents, I'm using it to simplify) if they do not exist, he says:      ""Consider the water atom as an allegedly indivisible substance in which inhere the qualities of color, shape, wetness and mass. Resistance to the notion that these qualities may be thought of as its parts comes from the intuition that qualities do not simply float freely in the air, that they must be tethered to something that then explains their occurrence together with other qualities. Bundle theorists are typically asked to provide the principle of qualitative unity that would explain the co- occurrence of many qualities in the absence of a substance in which they inhere. The Buddhist bundle theorist says this is the wrong question to be asking. Instead we should ask why, in the absence of empirical evidence for the existence of substances as distinct from their properties, we nonetheless have the intuition that substances are required to explain qualitative unity."" (pp. 59)      To say that ""in the absence of empirical evidence"" is just to beg the question. but he goes on to say:      ""By hypothesis, color, shape, wetness, and mass tropes are compresent at a certain spatio- temporal location. This much both sides can agree on. Here is a possible explanation of the fact that we commonly take these to all be properties of a single thing, the water atom. When we wish to specify the location of this mass trope, it is easier to indicate it by using the term “water atom” than by indicating each of the three other tropes present at that location. This makes the communication process more efficient. It also relieves us of the burden of ascertaining just which other tropes are present at that location, given that we know from past experience that mass tropes are generally accompanied by other tropes in a certain range. “Water atom” functions as a convenient designator for a certain bundle of tropes (TS 832– 34; TSP ad TS 581– 83). That they make up a bundle has as much to do with us and our interests and cognitive limitations as it does with how things are in the   world. The world as it is anyway contributes the fact of their compresence. The rest— their being unified by their joint inherence in a substance— is our doing. The Buddhist doctrine of the two truths is their answer to the bundle theorist’s problem of unification.""      Basically, he uses their conventionalist position to ""explain"" how we construe substances from things that are nothing but tropes.      (I will continue)  "
1749,theist,sceptic,"I think that the problem of ""god hiphotesis"" is a problem of theism personalist, present in different hue of philosophers of that faction. WLC with your KLC, although bright, in my humble opinion, fail to explain the concept of God and go more deeper in the concepts of contingency and necessity; this concepts showing a cogent way that the real question about God is that which is the fundamental of reality: something contingent, or a abstract, or concrete necessity."

439,theist,sceptic,"@Talmid What do you think about this argument in favor of the bundle theory of self?      1\. If there is more to an object than its properties, then it is possible to conceive of said object with all its properties stripped away.      2\. That is inconceivable.      3\. Therefore an object and its properties are one and the same.      Christians aren't allowed to believe in bundle theories of self, because we believe that G-d made us as perfect substances. That's why the church so strongly opposes this transgender madness."
1269,theist,sceptic,"According to Anselm, if G-d is the greatest conceivable being, then He would also be a person, because beings with personality are greater than beings without. That seems to imply theistic personalism."
593,sceptic,theist,"I’ll definitely have a look at your articles. I remember reading the Aristotelian proof ones way back when, and I found them interesting and often quite forcefully argued. In fact, several of your critiques overlap with several of mine developed independently, so I found that cool."
334,sceptic,theist,"Anyway, I also seem to recall Aquinas explicitly saying that God’s act of creation is intrinsic to God, and identical to God. In which case, that is the exact opposite of a Cambridge property which is an extrinsic relation that is outside of God. Aquinas says, “God does not act by an action that is outside Him, as though it went out from Him and terminated in a creature.”[24] According to Aquinas, “The manifold actions ascribed to God, like intelligence, volition, _the production of things_ , and the like, are not so many different things, since each of these actions in God is His very being, which is one and the same thing.”[25] For some reason I thought Aquinas said that. But who knows? Maybe Aquinas never said any of that. Maybe Feser is right to say something that directly contradicts what Aquinas explicitly says. Perhaps that is what it means to be a Thomist. I’m not really sure."
