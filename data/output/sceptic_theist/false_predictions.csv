2089,sceptic,theist,"(As an aside: In the case at hand, God would go from knowing p to knowing the negation of p, because he’s omniscient. I’m not saying that there are truths God doesn’t know.)"
1343,theist,sceptic,"Vincent, can you rephrase and elaborate on your last paragraph? I'm having a hard time following what you're suggesting. Are you saying that the traditional Aristotelian metaphysical model of act and potency cannot allow a bottom layer of physical reality?"
184,theist,sceptic,"Your penultimate paragraph suggests a new argument:      (1) We are justified in inferring the existence of a parental cause for any insects known to exist   (2) If (1) is true, then C is true   (3) Therefore, C is true.  "
1178,sceptic,theist,"But as Vallicella has argued, neither of these suggestions really makes any sense. Start with the suggestion that the parts of a thing are unified by some further part. For instance, consider a thing composed of parts A and B. What makes it the case that parts A and B are united in such a way that the composite thing in question exists? The suggestion at hand is that there is some further part, C, which accounts for A and B being united. But the problem is that this just pushes the problem back a stage, since we now need to ask what unites C together with A and B. If we posit yet another further part, D, in order to account for the unity of A, B, and C, then we will merely have pushed the problem back yet another stage. And of course the problem will just keep recurring for each further part we posit. (2017, pp. 83-84)"
900,theist,sceptic,"When based on a lie, a sound reasoning can be used to reach any conclusion, true or otherwise.      Small example: is the statement ""if 1=2 then 37=-1"" true or false? It is actually true and simple to demonstrate using some arithmetic rules:   Step 1: 1=2 (deduct 1 from both sides)   Step 2: 0=1 (multiply both sides by 38)   Step 3: 0=38 (deduct 1 from both sides)   Step 4: -1=37 q.e.d.      In short, ""if A then B"" is always true if A is false. All you need to do is to convince someone that A is actually true so that with sound reasoning you may conclude any consequence B at your convenience."
51,theist,sceptic,"Now, I assume that Hart accepts this distinction. If he does, though, then he should realize that his argument does not succeed, because the position he rejects does not entail attributing any passive potential in God (which would indeed be problematic) but rather only active potency. And if he does not accept the distinction, then his argument simply begs the question against his critics, who do accept it."

1023,theist,sceptic,"**_hypothesis_** _, n. a conditional or provisional explanation of observed facts or of their connection with each other; a tentative explanation suggestive of further experiment and verification_."
564,theist,sceptic,"I really can't see your point here. If a being is simple on the sense that the classical cosmological arguments get them its existence is explained by its nature. If its existence has a explanation them there is no place for a brute fact, for a brute fact here would be a existence that has and has not a explanation.      Contigent things existence can be brute facts precisely because they can't explain themselves, so there is ground for they having no explanation at all. For instance, a being with potentials that are made actual could have the actualization happening by no reason, but there is not the same oportunity with Pure Act, for it has no potentials."
410,sceptic,theist,"The evidence for fine-tuning confirms both demiurgism and panentheism over theism, and in this way is good evidence against theism. This is because the intuitive and empirical evidence against creation _ex nihilo_ creates a strong drag on theism’s prior probability not suffered by demiurgism and panentheism, and so they lap the former in terms of posterior probability. _A fortiori_ , the posterior probability of the inclusive disjunction of demiurgism and panentheism is considerably higher than that of theism given the evidence of fine-tuning."
432,theist,sceptic,I forgot to say that G acts on X x V by acting on the first component in the proof.
99,sceptic,theist,"Whether you think the number two exists is irrelevant, since I’m concerned here with _in principle counterexamples_. The dialectic is similar to the following. Suppose you say that what makes it the case that an entity enjoys moral worth is that the entity, in its normal course of development, is capable of interpersonal communication. I respond by pointing out that this account would entail, absurdly, that an intelligent, rational, sentient alien species with no communicative practices or abilities would lack moral worth. Clearly, it’s no use responding to my counterexample that there are no such aliens. The point is that (i) if there _were_ such aliens, they _would_ have moral worth, and yet (ii) according to your account of moral worth, they _wouldn’t_. And so your account fails."
2063,theist,sceptic,"I suppose the main worry with this argument is that perhaps only an ought governing voluntary activity implies can. But the epistemic life is in large part involuntary. An eye ought to transmit visual information, but some eyes cannot—and that is not a problem because seeing is involuntary."

121,theist,sceptic,"And because pure (Tarskian) geometry is decidable, while the theory of the positive integers is not decidable, the positive integers are not definable in terms of pure geometry, so we cannot eliminate the quantification over positive integers. In fact, it is known that the rational numbers are not definable in terms of pure geometry either, so neither the incommensurability formulation nor theory irrationality formulation is a purely geometric claim."
1242,theist,sceptic,"Several new pages are also added to the previous edition’s discussion of divine freedom in the chapter on divine simplicity. (Davies’ views on this issue were the subject of [another post from years ago](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2010/05/davies-on-divine-simplicity-and- freedom.html).) Critics of divine simplicity often argue that it is incompatible with God’s having freely created the universe. For if God could have done other than what he has in fact done, doesn’t that entail that God is changeable, contrary to divine simplicity? And if he is in fact unchangeable or immutable, doesn’t that entail that he could not have done otherwise, and thus created of necessity rather than freely? In response, Davies points out, first, that creating _freely_ simply does not in fact entail _changing_. Certainly it simply begs the question to assume otherwise. For the classical theist, God creates _eternally_ or atemporally, and what is eternal or atemporal does not undergo change. Still, he could have done otherwise than create, so that this eternal act of creation is free."
1551,theist,sceptic,Yeah. I have a more general solution along the same lines. Will post soon.
1187,theist,sceptic,"Further to the above, here is a response explaining some of these points:      https://wmreview.co.uk/2022/11/07/honorius-de-mattei-feser-i/      Many thanks."
1452,sceptic,theist,"I’ll definitely have a look at your articles. I remember reading the Aristotelian proof ones way back when, and I found them interesting and often quite forcefully argued. In fact, several of your critiques overlap with several of mine developed independently, so I found that cool."

1441,sceptic,theist,[8] This doesn’t require the truth of nominalism. It just requires that God is different from us when it comes to the relationship between entitative character and property possession—something that classical theists already accept (albeit in a different fashion).
678,theist,sceptic,"In [my review](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2022/03/80430/) of Hart’s _You Are Gods_ , commenting on Hart’s view that creation follows inevitably from God’s nature, I noted that “it is hard to see how this is different from the Trinitarian claim that the Son is of necessity begotten by the Father; and if it isn’t different, then creation is no less divine than the Son is.” Hart’s necessitarian view of creation is thus one of several respects in which, as I noted in the review, his position collapses into a kind of pantheism. And as Pohle and Preuss note in their manual _God: His Knowability, Essence, and Attributes_ , against the traditional doctrine of divine perfection, it is precisely “Pantheists [who] object that ‘God plus the universe’ must obviously be more perfect than ‘God minus the universe’” (p. 188)."
2153,theist,sceptic,"Finally, compare this. Suppose Snaky a rattlesnake stretched along a line in space. Now suppose we simultaneously annihilate everything in Snaky. Now, “simultaneously” is presumably defined with respect to some reference frame _F_ 1. Let _z_ be a point in Snaky’s rattle located just prior (according to _F_ 1) to Snaky’s destruction. Then Snaky is partly present at _z_. But with a bit of thought, we can see that there is another reference frame _F_ 2 where the only parts of Snaky simultaneous with _z_ are parts of the rattle: all the non-rattle parts of Snaky have already been annihilated at _F_ 2, but the rattle has not. Then in _F_ 2 the following is true: there is a time at which Snaky exists but nothing outside of Snaky’s rattle exists. Hence Snaky can exist as just a rattle, albeit for a very, very short period of time."

605,theist,sceptic,"My charitable reading of Meyer and others is to think of them as positing God as an ultimate explanatory principle. Yes, God's existence can be demonstrated through reason alone. But the metaphysics backing that up is Platonic/Aristotelian. One can alway opt for the Humean route and just be stubborn in their fundamental commitments to bruteness and unintelligibility. It seems to me that we must posit the metaphysics from which our arguments derive as a 'hypothesis,' albeit a hypothesis which make the world intelligible by giving an ultimate explanation."
2,theist,sceptic,"Now, someone might also object that an argument need not get you _all_ the way to God to get you _part_ of the way. And that is perfectly true. Suppose, for example, that some version of the argument from contingency (such as those defended by Avicenna, Aquinas, and Leibniz) really does demonstrate the existence of an absolutely necessary being. That would certainly do much to establish classical theism, even if one did not go on to show that this necessary being had further divine attributes such as omnipotence and omniscience. For necessity itself is one of the divine attributes, which radically differentiates God from everything else, so that to establish that something exists of necessity is a crucial step on the way to a complete argument for theism."
809,theist,sceptic,"**Final remark:** The argument applies to any exclusive and exhaustive division of reasons into “simple” (i.e., non-combination) types."
759,sceptic,theist,"This could lead to one of two different conclusions. It might mean that the Jewish Scriptures and the majority of Muslims are implicitly affirming atheism because they deny divine simplicity. Alternatively, it might mean that neoclassical theism is a very old, and well-established position within the history of Western philosophical theology. I’ll let you decide which is the correct conclusion."
1769,theist,sceptic,"According to Anselm, if G-d is the greatest conceivable being, then He would also be a person, because beings with personality are greater than beings without. That seems to imply theistic personalism."
