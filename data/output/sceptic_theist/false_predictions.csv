251,sceptic,theist,"I’ll definitely have a look at your articles. I remember reading the Aristotelian proof ones way back when, and I found them interesting and often quite forcefully argued. In fact, several of your critiques overlap with several of mine developed independently, so I found that cool."
630,theist,sceptic,"@ WCB,      Well since you assume for yourself the position of judge of these things, as I already explained, your unsurprising conclusion about them is entirely predictable, foregoing any reasoning at all.

483,sceptic,theist,"[15] If time is continuous, we can let the temporal state immediately prior to t refer to some suitably small finite interval of time—perhaps infinitesimally small—with t as its later-than bound."
613,theist,sceptic,"I really can't see your point here. If a being is simple on the sense that the classical cosmological arguments get them its existence is explained by its nature. If its existence has a explanation them there is no place for a brute fact, for a brute fact here would be a existence that has and has not a explanation.      Contigent things existence can be brute facts precisely because they can't explain themselves, so there is ground for they having no explanation at all. For instance, a being with potentials that are made actual could have the actualization happening by no reason, but there is not the same oportunity with Pure Act, for it has no potentials."
168,theist,sceptic,"Well, let's grant that that is a plausible explanation. Even if you want to suggest that evolution is a good explanation for why we have such a feature, that itself is a pretty bad explanation for the feature itself.      If you had no knowledge of biology and asked ""what is this pulsing thing inside my chest? This is weird. What's it doing? Why does it seem different than the rest of the things in my body?"" You would be thoroughly unimpressed with the response ""that's your heart. And it exists there because it was evolutionarily advantageous for you to have one. So we need investigate it no further. So don't go asking any more silly questions.""      Hand waving away consciousness by saying it is caused by evolution is the cause of it, you haven't done anything to address the substance of the philosophical arguments about why consciousness is so weird.

1376,theist,sceptic,"To a thing to be capable of fail to exist its essence has to be dependent on a second thing to be actual. This by the thing being composed of parts, that do need a actualizer to be together.      By contrast, Being Itself has no parts, so there is no need of a outside actualizer to join the parts. So He is there aways.      The modal truth describes that but it does not cause it to be the case."
1040,sceptic,theist,"This could lead to one of two different conclusions. It might mean that the Jewish Scriptures and the majority of Muslims are implicitly affirming atheism because they deny divine simplicity. Alternatively, it might mean that neoclassical theism is a very old, and well-established position within the history of Western philosophical theology. I’ll let you decide which is the correct conclusion."
538,sceptic,theist,"First, for all the reasoning here shows, the first cause could very well be an agent, God, with various passive potentials that could be actualized by _God himself_ , i.e., by God’s exercise of agent-causal power. The various changes in creation would be explained by reference to God’s creating and sustaining activity, and God’s _own_ passive potencies could be actualized by God _qua agent cause_. Agents actualize their own passive potentialities all the time—for instance, assuming agent-causal views in the metaphysics of action, I actualize my own passive potency to form intentions. (This doesn’t involve the passive potency _itself_ pulling itself into actuality by its own bootstraps, of course.) God, here, is quite clearly a first cause, and yet he has passive potencies. So the absence of passive potencies doesn’t follow upon being a first cause. (At least, not for the reasons Feser here adumbrates.)"
1189,theist,sceptic,"Further to the above, here is a response explaining some of these points:      https://wmreview.co.uk/2022/11/07/honorius-de-mattei-feser-i/      Many thanks."
486,theist,sceptic,"Kant was one of the world's greatest thinkers. He phillosophy foresaw quantum mechanics.      Kant did not view things-in-themselves as containing the sum of all possibilities, and phenomena all actualities; but this duality is conformable to Kant's metaphysics as to none other. As a contribution to the metaphysics of possibility, the quantum mechanical wave function can easily be seen as complementary to Kant's idea of things-in-themselves, where various kinds of things can happen (like free will) that are not comprehensible in terms of phenomenal reality. Kant would just have to allow that characteristics of physical reality can intrude some depth into things-in-themselves, which he would not have considered -- though we can also handle this by positing an intermediate level of reality, between true unconditioned things-in-themselves and true discrete phenomenal objects -- as Kant otherwise actually does himself for space and time as ""pure intuitions."" The wave function straddles the classic Kantian boundary, sharing some properties with phenomena, others, as underlying phenomena, with things-in-themselves.      Thus, where Kant would have considered all of phenomena governed by determinism, we now see the wave function as deterministic, while the collapse of waves into particles is random. Although chance in quantum mechanics has often been argued as allowing for free will, a free cause is still a very different thing from a random cause, which doesn't need mind or self or intention. Moral freedom is thus still left among things-in-themselves. Kant himself would have had difficulty placing randomness in his ontology, if he, like Hume, believed that chance violates determinism. Since chance is now part of the physics, it cannot be denied; but it also still remains a different matter from purposive freedom.      Kant's idea that space and time do not exist among things-in-themselves has been curiously affirmed by Relativity and quantum mechanics. In Relativity, time simply ceases to pass at the velocity of light: for photons that have travelled to us as part of the Cosmic Background Radiation, time has stood still for most of the history of the universe. On the other hand, quantum mechanics now posits ""non-locality,"" i.e. physical distances, and so the limitation of the velocity of light in Relativity, don't seem to exist. This means that although time may apply to the wave function, space may not. The full empirical reality of space is only found among discrete particles and objects.      This curious result is the consequence of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Paradox, which was intended by Einstein as a reductio ad absurdum of quantum mechanics. If, for instance, a positron and an election are both created from an energetic photon, the conservation of angular momentum requires that one be spinning one way, and the other the other. But the complementary spins are equally probable for each particle. Thus, in quantum mechanical terms, the wave functions of each particle divide without a discrete state being determined. The particles might then separate to even cosmological distances, but as soon as the spin of one particle is observed, the other particle must have the opposite spin, which means that the wave function has collapsed across those cosmological distances and caused the other particle to assume a predictable spin. If this occurs instantaneously, it would violate the limitation of the velocity of light in Special Relativity.      This has now been shown to actually occur on the basis of Bell's Theorem (from John Bell, 1928-1990), meaning that Quantum Mechanics does violate Special Relativity by allowing instantaneous interactions across even cosmological distances. However, once observed, processes must still obey Special Relativity and the limitations of spatial distance, creating the kind of duality described by Kant.                    "
427,theist,sceptic,"Finally, compare this. Suppose Snaky a rattlesnake stretched along a line in space. Now suppose we simultaneously annihilate everything in Snaky. Now, “simultaneously” is presumably defined with respect to some reference frame _F_ 1. Let _z_ be a point in Snaky’s rattle located just prior (according to _F_ 1) to Snaky’s destruction. Then Snaky is partly present at _z_. But with a bit of thought, we can see that there is another reference frame _F_ 2 where the only parts of Snaky simultaneous with _z_ are parts of the rattle: all the non-rattle parts of Snaky have already been annihilated at _F_ 2, but the rattle has not. Then in _F_ 2 the following is true: there is a time at which Snaky exists but nothing outside of Snaky’s rattle exists. Hence Snaky can exist as just a rattle, albeit for a very, very short period of time."

65,sceptic,theist,"Another, secondary response to Gel’s point is that we might have good reason for thinking that co-location of ordinary material objects is impossible. Lots of philosophers defend this on grounds independent of IoI."
904,sceptic,theist,"To take an example I have often used, suppose you explain, to someone who has never heard of them before (a young child, say), the nature or essence of a lion, of a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and of a unicorn. Then you tell him that, of these three animals, one exists, one used to exist but has gone extinct, and the other never existed and is fictional. You ask him to tell you, based on his new knowledge of the essences of each, which is which. Naturally, he couldn’t tell you. For there is nothing in the essence or nature of these things that could, by itself, tell you whether or not it exists. Existence is something _additional to_ the essence of a contingent thing. It doesn’t follow from such a thing’s essence. (2021)"

91,theist,sceptic,"Now, someone might also object that an argument need not get you _all_ the way to God to get you _part_ of the way. And that is perfectly true. Suppose, for example, that some version of the argument from contingency (such as those defended by Avicenna, Aquinas, and Leibniz) really does demonstrate the existence of an absolutely necessary being. That would certainly do much to establish classical theism, even if one did not go on to show that this necessary being had further divine attributes such as omnipotence and omniscience. For necessity itself is one of the divine attributes, which radically differentiates God from everything else, so that to establish that something exists of necessity is a crucial step on the way to a complete argument for theism."

2033,theist,sceptic," _It's hard for me to even understand why you would want to make such a distinction except unless you were motivated by the desire to deny the force of arguments for the existence of God._      The motivation stems from Kant's attempt to respond to Humean skepticism. Kant thinks metaphysical principles (e.g. every event must have a cause) can only be justified in virtue of their expressing conditions of the possibility of experience, viz. the conditions objects must satisfy in order to be objects of experience _for us_. But this suggests the need to distinguish between two says of considering objects, namely in relation to subjects with our forms of cognition (things as they appear to us) and independently of such relations (things as they are in themselves).      Now, I'm not a Kantian, and I don't think his views are ultimately satisfactory, but I hope this brief summary shows it isn't some misguided attempt to undermine natural theology."

310,theist,sceptic,"(Continuation)      So not just it's unfair and wrong to say that ""this usage is common to Aristotle"" but one thing that I noticed in the book of both authors is the somewhat intentional sidestep or ""shell game"" of problems - like they were trying intentionally guide the book in a way to evade potential questions to their points. To be fair, Siderits tried to address some points of that (I do recommend the reading of the Chapter 4 since the most relevant discussion of points that could be related to our philosophy concentrates there). But his position simply gives me the impression that he tries to misplace the substance into its parts (like a shell game) and then comes to the conclusion that the substance could not exist. In responding to how accidents are always found in the substances (he does not use the term accidents, I'm using it to simplify) if they do not exist, he says:      ""Consider the water atom as an allegedly indivisible substance in which inhere the qualities of color, shape, wetness and mass. Resistance to the notion that these qualities may be thought of as its parts comes from the intuition that qualities do not simply float freely in the air, that they must be tethered to something that then explains their occurrence together with other qualities. Bundle theorists are typically asked to provide the principle of qualitative unity that would explain the co- occurrence of many qualities in the absence of a substance in which they inhere. The Buddhist bundle theorist says this is the wrong question to be asking. Instead we should ask why, in the absence of empirical evidence for the existence of substances as distinct from their properties, we nonetheless have the intuition that substances are required to explain qualitative unity."" (pp. 59)      To say that ""in the absence of empirical evidence"" is just to beg the question. but he goes on to say:      ""By hypothesis, color, shape, wetness, and mass tropes are compresent at a certain spatio- temporal location. This much both sides can agree on. Here is a possible explanation of the fact that we commonly take these to all be properties of a single thing, the water atom. When we wish to specify the location of this mass trope, it is easier to indicate it by using the term “water atom” than by indicating each of the three other tropes present at that location. This makes the communication process more efficient. It also relieves us of the burden of ascertaining just which other tropes are present at that location, given that we know from past experience that mass tropes are generally accompanied by other tropes in a certain range. “Water atom” functions as a convenient designator for a certain bundle of tropes (TS 832– 34; TSP ad TS 581– 83). That they make up a bundle has as much to do with us and our interests and cognitive limitations as it does with how things are in the   world. The world as it is anyway contributes the fact of their compresence. The rest— their being unified by their joint inherence in a substance— is our doing. The Buddhist doctrine of the two truths is their answer to the bundle theorist’s problem of unification.""      Basically, he uses their conventionalist position to ""explain"" how we construe substances from things that are nothing but tropes.      (I will continue)  "
