1286,theist,sceptic,"Hi everyone,      What I'm saying is that if potency has to be grounded in act (as Scholastics themselves acknowledge) then the existence of a bottom layer of pure passive potency is impossible, because there's be nothing actual to ground it.      On top of that, the traditional Thomistic picture of a thing as composed of three elements (or essence [=prime matter plus substantial form] plus existence), is ridiculously artificial. Time for some metaphysical pruning. Cheers."

1112,sceptic,theist,"Would Dr Feser appreciate being labelled an “internet classical theist” (as the word “other” implies)? Yes, he’s pretty prominent on the internet (for a field like his, anyway), but the description seems to be needlessly demeaning."
939,sceptic,theist,"Anyway, I also seem to recall Aquinas explicitly saying that God’s act of creation is intrinsic to God, and identical to God. In which case, that is the exact opposite of a Cambridge property which is an extrinsic relation that is outside of God. Aquinas says, “God does not act by an action that is outside Him, as though it went out from Him and terminated in a creature.”[24] According to Aquinas, “The manifold actions ascribed to God, like intelligence, volition, _the production of things_ , and the like, are not so many different things, since each of these actions in God is His very being, which is one and the same thing.”[25] For some reason I thought Aquinas said that. But who knows? Maybe Aquinas never said any of that. Maybe Feser is right to say something that directly contradicts what Aquinas explicitly says. Perhaps that is what it means to be a Thomist. I’m not really sure."
332,sceptic,theist,"[29] As Merricks (2019, p. 594) points out, several authors seem to agree that Turner’s approach (or something exactly like it in relevant respects) is the pluralist’s best hope for stating their view. See, e.g., Loux (2012) and van Inwagen (2014)."
527,theist,sceptic,"Several new pages are also added to the previous edition’s discussion of divine freedom in the chapter on divine simplicity. (Davies’ views on this issue were the subject of [another post from years ago](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2010/05/davies-on-divine-simplicity-and- freedom.html).) Critics of divine simplicity often argue that it is incompatible with God’s having freely created the universe. For if God could have done other than what he has in fact done, doesn’t that entail that God is changeable, contrary to divine simplicity? And if he is in fact unchangeable or immutable, doesn’t that entail that he could not have done otherwise, and thus created of necessity rather than freely? In response, Davies points out, first, that creating _freely_ simply does not in fact entail _changing_. Certainly it simply begs the question to assume otherwise. For the classical theist, God creates _eternally_ or atemporally, and what is eternal or atemporal does not undergo change. Still, he could have done otherwise than create, so that this eternal act of creation is free."
342,sceptic,theist,"Pascal famously argued that practical reasoning should lead people to try to form within themselves a commitment to religious practice and obedience, based upon a belief in God. I propose to take a less ambitious argument, which I call the Sensible Argument, and use it to present The Puzzle. I argue that there is a huge puzzle here, about the radical dissonance between the beliefs and practices of many of the purportedly religious. There are, I will argue, good reasons to doubt, concerning many (clearly not all or indeed most) purported religious believers, whether they are indeed believers, or at least whether their beliefs are strong; and religion seems to greatly increase the risks of deception, duplicity, and hypocrisy, as well as self-deception and inauthenticity. By turning towards a religious form of life, one will therefore be adding great morality-related risks. Arguably, if there is a God who deeply cares about individual moral behaviour, he would punish religious moral transgressors more than the secular ones. One is unlikely to be saved from hell (or other severe divine punishment) by becoming religious. If one is going to wager, it seems much more sensible to wager on the secular side."
486,sceptic,theist,"[1] Pruss and Rasmussen (2018), for instance, offer an argument along these lines for one of their principles."
670,theist,sceptic,"According to the James–Lange theory of emotions, emotions correspond to physiological states of the brain. That means that, according to William James, when a transgender girl feels like a girl, there is something in the brain that is generating that consistent, stable feeling."
694,theist,sceptic,4\. But Hart has another argument that might at first glance seem to be precisely the kind that should trouble his critics:
756,sceptic,theist,"To be sure, there are more besides. I’m simply giving a flavor of the explanations on offer that make no appeal to conserving or sustaining causes."
1304,sceptic,theist,"Imagine we live in 500 B.C. without any knowledge of the underlying chemistry of chemical species A, B, and C. I have gone blind recently, but you haven’t. Before going blind, I interacted a lot with A and B and know that they are colorless liquids. But neither you nor I have combined A and B together to see what results. Today, though, that’s going to change. We combine A and B together to produce C. You can see that C is a vibrant red liquid. I, of course, cannot. You tell me it’s vibrant red. I scoff, responding with the following:"
1687,theist,sceptic,"@ WCB,      Well since you assume for yourself the position of judge of these things, as I already explained, your unsurprising conclusion about them is entirely predictable, foregoing any reasoning at all.      The sheriff, the judge, and the press are all one person.      Tom Cohoe  "
1900,sceptic,theist,"This follows from the _factivity of knowledge_. Knowledge is factive—in other words, one can only know that p is true if p is, in fact, true. It cannot be the case that one knows p but p is false. E.g., It’s true that 1+1 is 2, and so it makes no sense to say that I _know_ 1+1 _isn’t_ 2."
963,sceptic,theist,"[3] As Paul points out, her one-category ontology is compatible with a parts- to-whole mosaic, as well as a holistic whole-to-parts picture. She prefers the latter because it's a better fit with with quantum holism/entanglement phenomena."
1551,theist,sceptic,"(Continuation)      So not just it's unfair and wrong to say that ""this usage is common to Aristotle"" but one thing that I noticed in the book of both authors is the somewhat intentional sidestep or ""shell game"" of problems - like they were trying intentionally guide the book in a way to evade potential questions to their points. To be fair, Siderits tried to address some points of that (I do recommend the reading of the Chapter 4 since the most relevant discussion of points that could be related to our philosophy concentrates there). But his position simply gives me the impression that he tries to misplace the substance into its parts (like a shell game) and then comes to the conclusion that the substance could not exist. In responding to how accidents are always found in the substances (he does not use the term accidents, I'm using it to simplify) if they do not exist, he says:      ""Consider the water atom as an allegedly indivisible substance in which inhere the qualities of color, shape, wetness and mass. Resistance to the notion that these qualities may be thought of as its parts comes from the intuition that qualities do not simply float freely in the air, that they must be tethered to something that then explains their occurrence together with other qualities. Bundle theorists are typically asked to provide the principle of qualitative unity that would explain the co- occurrence of many qualities in the absence of a substance in which they inhere. The Buddhist bundle theorist says this is the wrong question to be asking. Instead we should ask why, in the absence of empirical evidence for the existence of substances as distinct from their properties, we nonetheless have the intuition that substances are required to explain qualitative unity."" (pp. 59)      To say that ""in the absence of empirical evidence"" is just to beg the question. but he goes on to say:      ""By hypothesis, color, shape, wetness, and mass tropes are compresent at a certain spatio- temporal location. This much both sides can agree on. Here is a possible explanation of the fact that we commonly take these to all be properties of a single thing, the water atom. When we wish to specify the location of this mass trope, it is easier to indicate it by using the term “water atom” than by indicating each of the three other tropes present at that location. This makes the communication process more efficient. It also relieves us of the burden of ascertaining just which other tropes are present at that location, given that we know from past experience that mass tropes are generally accompanied by other tropes in a certain range. “Water atom” functions as a convenient designator for a certain bundle of tropes (TS 832– 34; TSP ad TS 581– 83). That they make up a bundle has as much to do with us and our interests and cognitive limitations as it does with how things are in the   world. The world as it is anyway contributes the fact of their compresence. The rest— their being unified by their joint inherence in a substance— is our doing. The Buddhist doctrine of the two truths is their answer to the bundle theorist’s problem of unification.""      Basically, he uses their conventionalist position to ""explain"" how we construe substances from things that are nothing but tropes.      (I will continue)  "
2078,sceptic,theist,[8] This doesn’t require the truth of nominalism. It just requires that God is different from us when it comes to the relationship between entitative character and property possession—something that classical theists already accept (albeit in a different fashion).
1361,theist,sceptic,"I really can't see your point here. If a being is simple on the sense that the classical cosmological arguments get them its existence is explained by its nature. If its existence has a explanation them there is no place for a brute fact, for a brute fact here would be a existence that has and has not a explanation.      Contigent things existence can be brute facts precisely because they can't explain themselves, so there is ground for they having no explanation at all. For instance, a being with potentials that are made actual could have the actualization happening by no reason, but there is not the same oportunity with Pure Act, for it has no potentials."

583,theist,sceptic,"I think that the problem of ""god hiphotesis"" is a problem of theism personalist, present in different hue of philosophers of that faction. WLC with your KLC, although bright, in my humble opinion, fail to explain the concept of God and go more deeper in the concepts of contingency and necessity; this concepts showing a cogent way that the real question about God is that which is the fundamental of reality: something contingent, or a abstract, or concrete necessity."
2,sceptic,theist,"Any distinction that we mere mortals might come up with in our minds cannot pick out any such distinction in God. As I have pointed out elsewhere, the denial that conceptual distinctions apply to God is not some irrelevant remark. It is actually crucial to medieval arguments from divine simplicity to divine timelessness.[22] To be fair to Feser, he may have missed this discussion in my writings. I only bring them up all the time, so it would be easy to miss."
