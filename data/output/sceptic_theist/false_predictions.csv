211,sceptic,theist,"Suppose the principle is true. Now go to a possible world in which God refrains from creating (assume, as traditional theism does, that God has leeway freedom in creating). In that world, there are contingent things uncreated by God (namely, absences of creatures). But according to traditional theism's aseity-sovereignty doctrine, there can be no contingent things that are not created by God. Therefore, traditional theism is false."
383,theist,sceptic,"Are there good treatments of the relation between divine simplicity and the essence-energies distinction? I do see some eastern orthodox thinkers comment on it but usually to argue against the thomist version of divine simplicity, so someone who do explain how both go together would be very interesting."
350,theist,sceptic,"**Final remark:** The argument applies to any exclusive and exhaustive division of reasons into ‚Äúsimple‚Äù (i.e., non-combination) types."
128,sceptic,theist,There are two troubles with this argument.[14] As the problems appear in my book:
1553,sceptic,theist,Justification: it‚Äôs manifest and evident to the senses. Many in your audience will get that reference.
1245,sceptic,theist,I was wondering if you could recommend any literature on the topic of whether accepting the DDS is tantamount to endorsing atheism/naturalism. Thanks!
368,sceptic,theist,"Finally, here‚Äôs an article I wrote last year, in response to Dr. Gaven Kerr and Pat Flynn (who interviewed him). It represents my current thinking on classical theism and DDS, as well as some speculations on the nature of God:"
56,theist,sceptic,"To a thing to be capable of fail to exist its essence has to be dependent on a second thing to be actual. This by the thing being composed of parts, that do need a actualizer to be together.      By contrast, Being Itself has no parts, so there is no need of a outside actualizer to join the parts. So He is there aways.      The modal truth describes that but it does not cause it to be the case."
535,theist,sceptic,"""X is necessary"" is a modal truth.      But this truth is the case thanks to X essence being what it is, not the contrary. Both ontologic and epistemic the essence goes first  "
771,theist,sceptic,"1- I don't care about what is taught by the Church, so I'll ignore that;      2- I also don't care about what Scripture teaches;      3- Aren't you getting Essence and Existence confused with Form and Matter? Knowing whether a Tasmanian tiger exists or not is a matter of knowing whether it has Existence or not, not what its Matter is. Sure, the existence of an animal might require its material exemplification, but this is not the case with immaterial beings (such as souls, angels, God, or any other candidates). What you are pointing to is precisely the difference between Essence and Existence - that you can know what-a-thing-is without knowing that-a-thing-is. It's not the same as what form a thing has versus its material cause (which also could or could not exist). I don't know what you mean by ""Pure Existence"" being vague or not infinite but Aquinas has some pretty good arguments for why Pure Existence is infinite, divine, etc.      More importantly, why are you ignoring the entire rationale for Divine Simplicity? It seems to be a recurring thing among critics. You point apparent problems but then ignore the arguments given for simplicity.      I speak as a person who has no ulterior motives; I simply am convinced that the First Cause of all things must be absolutely simple. If it had parts, then it would be dependent upon those parts for its existence, and thus would not be perfectly independent. Yet cosmological arguments require a foundation that is entirely independent of anything, which just is necessary existence, unconditioned. A composite is always conditioned by its parts, its existence is always ""iffy"" and dependent on the parts. So if ""God"" had parts, the parts would be the First Principles, not the composite. And if you follow that along, you'll reach some really bad problems.   And if God had an accident distinct of himself (his essence), where would this accident come from? It can't come from the essence lest you accept the precedence of a perfectly simple Essence which is the source of all things, which is what you're trying to avoid. But there is nowhere for the accident to come from, then, and being an accident, it cannot exist ""by its own (non- substantial, hence conditioned and dependent) nature"". You know classical authors reflected a lot on these matters and didn't just adopt Divine Simplicity because of church teaching, right?      4- And yet the same happens with libertarian freedom for us as well. Before you make your choice, there is a point in which there is no difference in your properties between world 1 (where you go on to choose X) and world 2 (where you go on to not choose X). So do you reject libertarian free will for humans too? Since I accept LFW, I already cannot accept that objection.      If I had to accept it, though, I would rather embrace necessitarian emanationism or optimism etc. than reject Simplicity, speaking for myself.      5- This objection wouldn't just cut against Divine Simplicity; it would also cut against creation being the result of a free choice, given what I said in 4. And you seem to be presupposing that an explanans must determine the explanandum, which is very doubtful (especially if it would cost us standard free will explanations);      6- Again, don't care about what Scripture says in philosophical matters (philosophy and rational argument always comes first to me) but Divine Simplicity isn't incompatible with God being personal. God *is* personal, and literally so, since he is the ultimate source of personhood. He's just eminently personal by virtue of a greater perfection (a single one) which includes the actualities of all others in a unified way."
1018,sceptic,theist,"However, if Neo-Lorentzianism is true, then space and time only _appear_ , and do not actually, satisfy Lorentz invariance, a symmetry principle central to Special Relativity. Although Lorentz invariance _itself_ cannot be directly experimentally or observationally verified, Lorentz invariance has motivated highly successful work in particle physics, including the development of quantum electrodynamics. Quantum electrodynamics has enjoyed incredible empirical success; as one example, quantum electrodynamics predicts a correction to the magnetic moment of the electron that has been experimentally verified to within around one part in a trillion (Gabrielse, et al, 2019; Hanneke, et al, 2008). Never mind precisely what Lorentz invariance or the magnetic moment are; our point is that quantum electrodynamics makes the most accurate prediction in the history of science. This degree of empirical success would be very surprising if Neo-Lorentzianism turned out to be true."
1720,sceptic,theist,"Would Dr Feser appreciate being labelled an ‚Äúinternet classical theist‚Äù (as the word ‚Äúother‚Äù implies)? Yes, he‚Äôs pretty prominent on the internet (for a field like his, anyway), but the description seems to be needlessly demeaning."
2087,theist,sceptic,"I was thinking the exact same thing. This blog is nothing but Feser, Feser, Feser."
1034,sceptic,theist,"Once again, this is obviously true. (Moreover, I have already explained why it‚Äôs true earlier in this post.)"
907,sceptic,theist,"[8] Note that this is a stipulative definition of ‚Äòdestruction‚Äô. We recognize that it may sound odd to call it ‚Äòdestruction‚Äô. (Then again, lots of our ordinary concepts sound odd when adapted or applied to perdurantism.) What matters for present purposes is that we have a clear and precise definition of the relevant concept. If the reader still demurs at our usage, simply replace the word with another, more fitting one."
1454,theist,sceptic,"Probability-match: _E_ _p_ 1 _A_ = _p_ ( _A_ ) for any event _A_ , where 1 _A_ is 1 on _A_ and 0 elsewhere"
963,sceptic,theist,"**Fourth** , please cite this post if you will be using its content in any way. Fair use rules apply to the whole post. üôÇ"
886,sceptic,theist,"I (really, we‚ÄîDJ and I) have raised a dozen (or so) taxonomic questions for inertial theses. In order to appreciate the larger picture, I‚Äôve listed each of the taxonomic questions below:"
1181,sceptic,theist,"I thank DJ Linford for writing this section. It is not 100% complete ‚Äî it is still under construction. But once it is complete, this blog post will be updated."
1501,sceptic,theist,"[3] As Paul points out, her one-category ontology is compatible with a parts- to-whole mosaic, as well as a holistic whole-to-parts picture. She prefers the latter because it's a better fit with with quantum holism/entanglement phenomena."
1067,sceptic,theist,"[29] As Merricks (2019, p. 594) points out, several authors seem to agree that Turner‚Äôs approach (or something exactly like it in relevant respects) is the pluralist‚Äôs best hope for stating their view. See, e.g., Loux (2012) and van Inwagen (2014)."
838,theist,sceptic,"Walter, yes, that‚Äôs what I intended but failed to say. Schmid has made some interesting rejoinders against the internal coherence of divine simplicity.      I think the arguments FOR simplicity are good. So it‚Äôs an interesting situation.      ‚Äî Pat"
256,theist,sceptic,"Wow, he does sound very much like a classical theist. He even seems to touch on St. Thomas* distinction between essence and existence.      Very cool stuff.      *i do feel like the distinction started with Avicenna"
2021,theist,sceptic,"And because pure (Tarskian) geometry is decidable, while the theory of the positive integers is not decidable, the positive integers are not definable in terms of pure geometry, so we cannot eliminate the quantification over positive integers. In fact, it is known that the rational numbers are not definable in terms of pure geometry either, so neither the incommensurability formulation nor theory irrationality formulation is a purely geometric claim."
1604,sceptic,theist,"This is just what succession means‚Äîto go from one thing to another. It‚Äôs also just what potential means‚ÄîGod has the potential, here, to acquire knowledge."
78,theist,sceptic,"Vincent, can you rephrase and elaborate on your last paragraph? I'm having a hard time following what you're suggesting. Are you saying that the traditional Aristotelian metaphysical model of act and potency cannot allow a bottom layer of physical reality?"
861,theist,sceptic,"Finally, compare this. Suppose Snaky a rattlesnake stretched along a line in space. Now suppose we simultaneously annihilate everything in Snaky. Now, ‚Äúsimultaneously‚Äù is presumably defined with respect to some reference frame _F_ 1. Let _z_ be a point in Snaky‚Äôs rattle located just prior (according to _F_ 1) to Snaky‚Äôs destruction. Then Snaky is partly present at _z_. But with a bit of thought, we can see that there is another reference frame _F_ 2 where the only parts of Snaky simultaneous with _z_ are parts of the rattle: all the non-rattle parts of Snaky have already been annihilated at _F_ 2, but the rattle has not. Then in _F_ 2 the following is true: there is a time at which Snaky exists but nothing outside of Snaky‚Äôs rattle exists. Hence Snaky can exist as just a rattle, albeit for a very, very short period of time."
742,sceptic,theist,"First, for all the reasoning here shows, the first cause could very well be an agent, God, with various passive potentials that could be actualized by _God himself_ , i.e., by God‚Äôs exercise of agent-causal power. The various changes in creation would be explained by reference to God‚Äôs creating and sustaining activity, and God‚Äôs _own_ passive potencies could be actualized by God _qua agent cause_. Agents actualize their own passive potentialities all the time‚Äîfor instance, assuming agent-causal views in the metaphysics of action, I actualize my own passive potency to form intentions. (This doesn‚Äôt involve the passive potency _itself_ pulling itself into actuality by its own bootstraps, of course.) God, here, is quite clearly a first cause, and yet he has passive potencies. So the absence of passive potencies doesn‚Äôt follow upon being a first cause. (At least, not for the reasons Feser here adumbrates.)"
1711,theist,sceptic,Seems not.      Perhaps David's response was the correct one to make.
1558,theist,sceptic,"Well, let's grant that that is a plausible explanation. Even if you want to suggest that evolution is a good explanation for why we have such a feature, that itself is a pretty bad explanation for the feature itself.      If you had no knowledge of biology and asked ""what is this pulsing thing inside my chest? This is weird. What's it doing? Why does it seem different than the rest of the things in my body?"" You would be thoroughly unimpressed with the response ""that's your heart. And it exists there because it was evolutionarily advantageous for you to have one. So we need investigate it no further. So don't go asking any more silly questions.""      Hand waving away consciousness by saying it is caused by evolution is the cause of it, you haven't done anything to address the substance of the philosophical arguments about why consciousness is so weird.  "
194,theist,sceptic,@Son of Ya'Kov et al.   Hey J! I hope things go well with you and your family.   I haven't found Fonseca's remarks directly. Citations from them are on this blog on Patheos Catholic:      https://www.patheos.com/blogs/steelmagnificat/2022/10/yes-you-can-leave-in- dialogue-with-a-twitter-traditionalist/
322,sceptic,theist,"If there is succession in God‚Äôs life [and, moreover, if God has potential that becomes actual], then God is temporal."
1909,theist,sceptic,I‚Äôm curious whether one can infer the causal principle _C_ that everything that comes into existence has a cause inductively on the basis of our observations of things with causes.
1435,sceptic,theist,"You are probably familiar with a particular trope by now. Internet classical theists will respond to all objections by saying, ‚ÄúYou have misunderstood Aquinas.‚Äù This is something that we joke about often. We have made so many memes making fun of this incredibly tired response to any and all objections. To be clear, there can be cases of misunderstanding the classical tradition, and it is a good thing to point those out when they arise. Yet the constant accusation of ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand Aquinas‚Äù from Feser and others is getting old."
1455,theist,sceptic,"This is a fun puzzle. It seems like David Lewis‚Äô convention work, or Thomas Schelling‚Äôs coordination and focal points stuff must be relevant."
413,sceptic,theist,"As Tomasewski (2019, p. 279) rightly points out, ‚ÄúDDS is directly committed only to (2), that is, to the identity of God and His act of creation.‚Äù And this is so because under DDS, God is identical to _each_ of his acts or actions."
310,sceptic,theist,"At best, then, this is a case of a _continually perpetuating_ , rather than sustaining, cause‚Äîa cause such that its instantaneous removal (i) does not necessitate the instantaneous removal of the effect but (ii) contributes to the removal of the effect after a (sometimes short) duration of time."
1546,theist,sceptic,Why can't Being fail to exist? Because there is a modal truth that says so?
158,sceptic,theist,These responses also take care of Gel‚Äôs ensuing discussion involving pine trees and whatnot.
591,sceptic,theist,Thanks for this excellent and thoughtful and effective reply to Feser. I agree with the other reader that keeping it civil and collegial is generally the most productive strategy for addressing disagreements and misunderstandings.
