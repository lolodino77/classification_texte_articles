I argue that complex the­ists, those who think that God has ontologically distinct parts or attributes, face the same problems. Current proposals for the metaphysics of complex theism do not offer any greater unity or ontological independence than pantheism, since they are modeled on priority monism. I then discuss whether the for­mal distinction of John Duns Scotus offers a way forward for complex theists. I show that only those classical theists who affirm divine simplicity are better off with respect to aseity and unity than pantheists. Only proponents of divine simplicity can fairly claim to have found a fully independent ultimate being"
1212,sceptic,theist,"Consensus? That’s your justification for calling 5000 years of recorded history a lie? The better question is, “Were you there?” If not, you have less historical documentation from which to make your assumptions about Christ’s life than the average local minister. You have absolutely nothing to prove you are correct other than the writings of modern day cynics, unbelievers, skeptics and other assorted disgruntled humans. This is hardly the kind of “proof” that any reasonable person could use and still come to your conclusions. And certainly their writings are nothing of value to anyone who is seriously seeking the truth because most begin with personal assumptions based on their own “feelings” versus the eyewitness accounts of the 12 men who lived with Jesus, 11 of whom were viciously martyred, rather than deny their faith in Christ as the Son of God. You are in no position to have any opinion on these matters as you are even farther down the food chain than those you so blithely quote. God is good. That’s all you need to know.

Why not instead suppose that they each simply have their own (e.g.) _trope_ of _divinity_ or _pure-esse-hood_ (along lines similar to Dr. Joshua Sijuwade’s classical theistic, trope-theoretic model of God)? Or why not take a nominalist approach to such beings, such that there are no such things as divine properties that any such being possesses (and, _a fortiori_ , no properties they share in common)?[8] Or perhaps each being only possesses divinity or pure-esse-hood _analogously_ to the other being(s), such that we block the need for some essential feature that they share in common but nevertheless preserve our ability to truthfully and literally (albeity analogously) predicate ‘pure esse’ and ‘divine’ of _each_ of them.

(He says that Nelson Goodman’s book _The Structure of Appearance_ is a good example of how one can develop a substantive analysis of the way things seem to us in conscious awareness, whether or not Goodman’s account is ultimately successful.)

Among the substances in this more familiar world are things that we also call water atoms. But these, it turns out, are a many masquerading as a one"" (pp. 60). And if it was any doubt left between humean bundle theory and buddhist position I think this will suffice.      Siderits then brings up this purported answer to the problem of ""smuggling substance back in"": ""One might wonder whether the Buddhist reductionist is entitled to bring facts about human persons into their explanation, given that humans are themselves substances. But these substances are, they will reply, reducible to systems consisting of bundles of tropes behaving in accordance with causal laws. Among the behaviors explained by the relevant causal laws are the use of convenient designators by such systems. So the reductive explanation of the intuitions behind the posit of substances does not illegitimately smuggle substances into the explanans.""      And this brings yet another problem with them: the handwaving appeal to ""sciences"". It's not hard to find these guys arguing that there are ""stone- wise arranged atoms"" or that natural selection somehow vindicates the idea of impermanence (Garfield appeals a lot more for these kinds of things, that's why I'm not using his work that much). But that does not seem right, because that turns your metaphysics hostage to the scientific findings - the same findings that may overthrow your own view.      But if we come to focus on other points like their appeal to nominalism, they suffer from the same problems that Ed emphasized in TLS and Scholastics meta. The points like how they can even communicate with themselves if there are no universals - or even worse if there are just ""momentary beings"". But I think that their denial of universals has some relation with their momentariness thesis. And that's what I can't even understand in the first place. How can someone think that something analogous to the Heraclitean position is right in the first place? It's illogical. And someone might even say that, correctly, that the ""buddhist logic"" is very different from ""Aristotelian logic"". Fair enough. But that doesn't explain why someone might think that something so absurd as ""impermanent beings"" (let alone mereological nihilism, nominalism) is plausible in the first place. To affirm that ""there are no pots that last longer than a moment"" and that ""there is just a series of ephemeral pots one after another"" is not to disprove permanence, but to evade the problem altogether.

5599,sceptic,theist,"Many of these theories, he adds, “seem to leave common sense farther behind the more specific they become,” leading him to the conclusion that “no non- bizarre general theory of consciousness is available,” and, he suspects, not even constructable in principle.

881,theist,sceptic,"   Garrett, there seem to be several distinct topics in play here.      A metaphysically and theologically adequate account of Creation is a complex and elusive goal. The identification of Creation with the physical theory of the Big Bang is a very damaging scientistic error. In creation ex nihilo does not mean creation from nothing in the logical sense, but creation beginning in a state in which nothing exists except God. Divine ideas and the aether must be real in a timeless sense. But neither one has distinct existence.      The compatibility of Divine omniscience and free will is a very complex topic addressed in detail by a number of good books. I have already noted these. The compatibility of Molinism and Scotism, as possibly the only two accounts of free will that preserve this compatibility, is addressed in the paper, ''Molina and John Duns Scotus'' by Jean Pascal Anfray.      The Embodied Mind scientists want a neurophysiological account of mind and brain that is compatible with human free will. But they are scientists not philosophers and have no one to provide a metaphysical foundation for their account. It is rather the case that most psychology is materialistic and naturalistic, and provides no account of authentic free will. Freudianism is a major class of examples. The physical sciences seek explanations in terms of physical causation. The basic truth is that accounts of the brain based on the dynamics of neurons provide no foundation or account of the basic elements of a description of mind: thoughts, intentions, dispositions, acts of will, and emotions. This accounts for the popularity of theories of ''quantum consciousness,'' which seek to account for free will in terms of quantum- mechanical indeterminacy.      I have not thought systematically about the ""free will deniers."" I note there are many books and papers supporting this. I also note that many notions in sociology and criminology seek to prove that racist attitudes and judgments are preconscious and present in very early life of a child. Theories that maintain that control of either various types of sexual behavior, or of violent behavior, and of addictive behavior; are unconscious and not subject to will are now widespread. These theories are dangerous to a liberal, open society. I do not maintain there is an organized 'movement' opposed to the notion of free will. Physical science is predisposed in this manner; and various social theorists are quite willing to exploit these theories.        "

1220,theist,sceptic,"One might think that what I said earlier implies that in this difficult case the state should always allow people to follow their conscience, because after all it is worse to do wrong—and violating conscience is wrong—than to have wrong done to one.

1820,theist,sceptic,"""Suppose, for example, that someone said that he was contemplating Aquinas’s First Way or... I personally think both those arguments happen to be successful demonstrations of God’s existence.""      The First Way attempts to use scientifically testable observations as a basis for logical arguments for the existence of god.      The First Way is an argument from motion, which is offered in the general sense of change of heat in the example of heat-fire-wood. Motion is also used in its more common literal sense, as positional translation through space, in the example of hand-staff.      Thus, if one is using the First Way as an argument for the existence of god then the assertion of the existence of god is indeed a scientific hypothesis in that the examples of the First Way are scientifically falsifiable.      Science has already falsified the argument from motion, therefor the god hypothesis has been scientifically falsified, to the extent it depends upon the First Way, which has already been falsified.      The statement ""the staff moves only because it is put in motion by the hand"" is clearly false, as the staff will move ad infinitum (as Aristotle posited for motion in the void) absent an impeding medium. The fundamental error of Aristotle, Aquinas, Feser, and the majority of posters here is in failing to realize that space, for motion, is the functional equivalent of the void, and everything is in space, including the hand and the staff.      The false statement by Aquinas that ""the staff moves only because it is put in motion by the hand"" is based on the false notion that absent a continuous mover the staff will slow, and stop, and its motion will be lost, therefore, it was incorrectly thought, a mover is required to keep it moving.      In truth, all objects in the universe are part of a system of perpetual motion such that motion is never lost, only transferred and mutually perpetuated in some form.      ""arguing that nothing that is like that could exist even for an instant without a sustaining cause""   Feser has this back to front in a very strange inversion of logic.      If material exists at time1 and continues to exist at time2 that is no change in the existence of that material, therefore no changer is called for to account for no change.      If material exists at time1 and ceases to exist at time2 that is a change in the existence of that material, therefore a changer is called for to account for the change in the existence of that material.      Sustained existence = no change, therefore, no changer.   Unsustained existence = change, therefore, a changer.      Pretty simple. How Feser and all the good posters here can be confused on such an obvious point is a puzzlement indeed."

Over twenty thousand people lost large sums of money as a result of Keating’s scams. A significant portion of the victims lost their entire life savings, many of them senior citizens. In return for the millions of dollars Mother Teresa received from Keating (as well as the use of his private jet), Mother Teresa gave him a trinket that she had “blessed”. When Keating’s fraud was exposed, the courts asked her to return the money to whom it had been stolen. She declined. Her letter, preserved by the California court to whom it was addressed, read that she did not know anything about Keating’s fraud. She said, “I only know that he has always been kind and generous to God’s poor, and always ready to help whenever there was a need.” L. Seidman, the FDIC chair at the time, later wrote that Keating’s scam was “one of the most heartless and cruel frauds in modern memory.”"

5480,sceptic,theist,"Of relevance here are the reasons for this improvement. Did the Church outlaw execution of non-Christians by way of edict or mandate? Did the Church ask its members to stop blacklisting books? I think that reasons are much more complex than the erred belief that the Church experienced a dramatic 180 with respect to its imperialist behaviors. Given the United States’ Constitutional emphasis on religious freedom, for instance, a slew of hate crimes against non- Christian places of worship will be prosecuted heavily. Secular laws have acted as a deterrent against the Church’s imperialist agenda. This applies in the UK and Canada as well. I offer that this is not so much a moral improvement, but rather a logical fear of legal repercussions. The Church did not choose to cease acting immorally; it is deterred from committing various immoral acts by laws that have greater jurisdiction over those of the Church. The Muslim World is home to a number of modern theocracies that do not exhibit moral improvement. Would modern Christian theocracies look like Muslim ones? I will not qualify this here, but I can think of no reason to believe that Christian theocracies would be dissimilar to theocracies in the Muslim World."

811,sceptic,theist,"There are at least two problems with this argument for uniqueness. For starters, merely from the fact that God’s essence is not something that can be shared with anything else, it doesn’t follow that there cannot be more than one God. For all the argument shows, it could be that there are two Gods, _each of which is identical to its own unshared essence and existence_. We need not suppose that they _share one and the same essence_ ; they may simply have _different divine essences_. Perhaps one of them has a divine essence included in which is the essential attribute of _being trinitarian_ , whereas the other has a divine essence included in which is the essential attribute of _being unitarian_ , whereas a third has a divine essence included in which is the essential attribute of _being binitarian_. In this case, each God is identical to its own essence (and, we can suppose, its own existence), and yet there is no single essence that all the Gods share in common. Now, you might object that for each of them to be _Gods_ , they must at least minimally all share _some_ essential attribute, such as _divinity_ or _omnipotence_. But why? Why not instead suppose that they each simply have their own (e.g.) _trope_ of _divinity_ or _omnipotence_? Or why not take a nominalist approach to Gods, such that there are no such things as divine properties that any such God possesses (and, _a fortiori_ , no properties they could share in common)? Or perhaps each God only possesses omniscience, omnipotence, divinity, etc. _analogously_ to the rest, such that we block the need for features that they share in common but nevertheless preserve a _kind_ of common (albeit merely analogous) predication among them. To be sure, the _Thomist_ may not accept any of these possibilities; but that’s utterly irrelevant. What matters is whether the Thomist’s argument for uniqueness has given us any reason to _rule this out_ , to think _it’s impossible_."

There’s a deeper sense of indeterminacy in which even a Laplacean demon wouldn’t know the outcome, but what I’m arguing is that we don’t need that deeper sense. (In fact, I think we could simply reject the notion of “could’ve done otherwise” entirely, but let’s say we want to preserve it in some form.) So there are alternative possibilities open to us. Whether they count as “actual” or “genuine” possibilities is a subtlety that I want to explore here."
2694,sceptic,theist,"That leaves open the question as to why people on the right see these positions as fundamentally opposed to their brand of politics. Again, if your political party imposes these discriminatory and even racist views on you, it is good sign that you should renounce it. There are ways to be fiscally conservative, a proponent of small government, and so on without subscribing to views that promote racial, gender, and wealth inequality. I fail to see how what I have had outlined is unclear or nonsensical. The isms, once unpacked, should not be as controversial. This is why I prefer stating my positions clearly, so that there is no room for misconstruing, misrepresenting, straw manning, and so on. There is, in my book, a difference between an opponent and an enemy. The enmity I reserve for my enemies has everything to do with the fact that they think their ignorance is better than my knowledge, their apathy superior to my empathy, their desire to oppress groups they dislike equal to my desire for equality. Opponents, by contrast, can have their minds changed. The omission of relevant facts is not the same as ignorance. My enemies intend to ignore that which disagrees with or defeats their views and more importantly, they intend to cause harm to people like myself, so they do so by weaponizing their right to vote to further marginalized groups they want to harm. Then they pretend to be innocent because they are not drawing a firearm. They might as well. Voting for a candidate that does not care about the plights of minorities, women, non-Christians, etc. is a deliberate attempt to harm these groups. You are not innocent."

But his beliefs don't change.      Although a God who changed with and experienced time such that his beliefs also changed might be thus considered complex across time by having temporal parts, that would seem to be assuming an A-theory of time for all (including God), then importing a B perspective at the end, incoherently. So, simplicity of essence (at any point in time) and atemporality could be distinguished I suppose, such that a person could affirm both simplicity and temporality of God.

1292,sceptic,theist,"Tangentially, it can be granted that a weak pluralism should be allowed if only because foundationalist axioms can apply to logical and mathematical theorems. There are pure or abstract logical and mathematical theorems that have no correspondence to reality and as such, correspondence theory of truth has limits. For example, when doing mathematical proofs, there are multiples sets N (the set of natural numbers), Z ( the set of integers), Q (the set of rational numbers), and R (the set of real numbers); there are also D (the set of decimals) and C (the set of complex numbers), which are less common in proofs. One may come across a statement that reads “n ∈ Z,” which states that n is an element within the set of integers. More specifically, one might be asked to prove the statement “∀n ∈ Z . n(n + 1) is even.” This can be done by assuming that some natural number n is either odd or even. Upon making n = 2m, one will find that 2(m(n+1) and 2(nm) are both even, which proves the statement. This mathematical proof does not rely on tangible reality in the way someone may point to a polar bear on television to prove that the proposition “polar bears are white” is true. There are also properties in mathematics that are true by definition, i.e., _a priori_ , e.g., zero product property, associative property.

2827,theist,sceptic,"Vincent,   Jaegwon Kim, a prominent physicalist working on the mind-body problem concedes that the default position of human societies is not physicalism but dualism: “Something like this dualism of personhood, I believe, is common lore shared across most cultures and religious traditions.” (Mind in a Physical World: An Essay on the Mind-Body Problem and Mental Causation; Cambridge: MIT Press, 2000). Charles Taliaferro lists Michael Levin, Daniel Dennett, David Lewis, Thomas Nagel, J. J. C. Smart, Richard Rorty, Donald Davidson, and Colin McGinn as other non-dualist scholars working in philosophy of mind who concede that some commonsense view of dualism is held by the overwhelming number of humankind now and throughout history. Children are dualists. As Henry Wellman puts it, the recent findings of developmental psychology show that ""young children are dualists: knowledgeable of mental states and entities as ontologically different from physical objects"" (The Child's Theory of Mind; Cambridge: MIT Press, 1990). The presumption follows that Ancient Israel, like other ancient societies, would have held this commonsense dualism unless one can find evidence otherwise. What the Christian who claims that the Hebrew Bible advocates physicalism over dualism needs are arguments in the Hebrew Bible countering the prevailing assumption by ancient peoples of a basic dualism. There are none. The Hellenization thesis, as applied to physicalism, is a complete dud. Instead, basic dualism is at least the operating principle of the Hebrew Bible. And as bad as the position of Nancey Murphey, Brian Rosner, Paul Althaus and other Christian physicalists is, at least they are not global physicalists, i.e. they acknowledge that God is not composed of waves and limited to the speed of light.   The Hellenization thesis is discredited with regards to doctrines like divine impassibility (Paul Gavrilyuk and several others show this) but it is even more discredited with respect to the Ancient Israelites were physicalists stuff."

Your original statement implied, to me, an ontological statement but your latest statement implies you were referring to the epistemological state which I agree with.

2858,sceptic,theist,"As is often pointed out by critics of classical theism, doctrines like simplicity and impassibility are anti-biblical in the sense that they contradict the explicit teachings of scripture.[3] James A. Diamond says that philosophical notions like divine simplicity “actually requires a violent distortion of the original Jewish scriptures, imposing a notion of the Deity that is foreign both to the written text and its voluminous oral interpretive traditions.”[4] Yoram Hazony says that simplicity and immutability contradict the meaning of the revealed the name YWHW in Exodus 3:14.[5] You might be tempted to say that the Jewish biblical and rabbinic tradition are not engaged in philosophical reasoning, so this cannot count as part of the Western philosophical reflection on the nature of God. If you are tempted to say silly things like that, allow me to recommend Dru Johnson’s book, _Biblical Philosophy_."
1867,theist,sceptic," _However, in ""Five Proofs of the Existence of God"" (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 2017), you write: ""And a composite is less fundamental than its parts in the sense that its existence presupposes that its parts exist and are put together in the right way"" (p. 70)._      He says there is a _sense_ in which the parts are more fundamental. On the very page before that he says ""There is a sense in which, in each of these cases, the parts are less fundamental than the whole"" and then goes on to give examples of why.      I swear, it seems like you're addicted to being mindlessly petty and contrarian on Ed's blog over every little thing he says, presumably because you're still mad at him over his criticisms of common ID approaches a few years back, even when the most cursory reading of his remarks makes it obvious that you're butchering his point, and even when your nitpicks undermine your *own* theistic metaphysics where they overlap with his."

If _A_ causes _B_ and _B_ causes _C_ but there is no explanation of _A_ , then it seems that _B_ and _C_ are really unexplained. Aristotle notes that there was a presocratic philosopher who explained why the earth doesn’t fall down by saying that it floats on water, and he notes that the philosopher failed to ask the same question about the water. I think one lesson of Aristotle’s critique is that if it is unexplained why the water doesn’t fall down it is unexplained why the earth falls down."

1745,sceptic,theist,"First, for all the reasoning here shows, the first cause could very well be an agent, God, with various passive potentials that could be actualized by _God himself_ , i.e., by God’s exercise of agent-causal power. The various changes in creation would be explained by reference to God’s creating and sustaining activity, and God’s _own_ passive potencies could be actualized by God _qua agent cause_. Agents actualize their own passive potentialities all the time—for instance, assuming agent-causal views in the metaphysics of action, I actualize my own passive potency to form intentions. (This doesn’t involve the passive potency _itself_ pulling itself into actuality by its own bootstraps, of course.) God, here, is quite clearly a first cause, and yet he has passive potencies. So the absence of passive potencies doesn’t follow upon being a first cause. (At least, not for the reasons Feser here adumbrates.)"

5358,sceptic,theist,"So, if you’ve ever found yourself thinking “These are all terrible options,” then mysterianism might be for you. But it doesn’t need to be framed negatively. We could just as easily reframe it positively: everyone makes really convincing arguments against opposing views. When materialists level objections to dualism, they’re right! They’re offering good arguments. When non-physicalists level objections to physicalism, they’re right! They’re offering good arguments. Rather than thinking “All these options suck,” you could just as well think that everyone is making cogent points all around. There are good arguments against materialism, dualism, panpsychism, and so on; there are really compelling reasons to reject each of these options. Maybe there are deep, in principle reasons we can’t come up with a satisfying explanation of consciousness."
68,theist,sceptic,"In Dr. Feser's twitter account there was a response to the original tweets that I think captures what seems to me a very obvious problem with this criticism of Meyer. Jonathan wrote: ""I don’t think the point of these arguments is to make God contingent, but to argue for his existence probabilistically. I don’t see an issue with arguing for a metaphysically necessary being with abduction."" To object to this is to say that a contingent argument necessarily entails that the being argued for is contingent. That seems to me quite obviously false. It is the argument that is being characterized as contingent and this does not tell us that the being argued for is either contingent or necessary.      Dr. Feser responded to this tweet saying: ""I know they don't intend to make God contingent. But if an argument leaves it even possible that the world might exist apart from X, then to establish X isn't to establish God (Note that that doesn't entail that X is not God, but only that the arg doesn't establish that X is God)"" My response to this is that their aim is not to ""establish"" God (i.e. the God of Classical Theism who is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob). ID folks are very explicit about this. Their goal is not a scholastic demonstration. After all their arguments are contingent and proceed by way of abduction following the work of Pierce. That this approach does not get us all the way to classical theism and the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob seems to me no grounds for criticizing it as though it accomplishes nothing.      This appears to me like an older brother who is an exceptional and developed artist criticizing his younger brother for making initial efforts at art because those efforts are not as precise and clear. What would be the point of such an attack? It would certainly seem to me unnecessarily discouraging to the younger brother especially when the two approaches are not mutually exclusive.      The point I am making is consistent with Wuellner's definition: ""a conditional or provisional explanation of observed facts or of their connection with each other"". This can be taken in two ways. It can either entail that the existence of the thing that explains the phenomena is contingent and that its relationship to the thing caused is contingent *OR* it could mean that the explanation qua explanation is contingent (i.e. a contingent argument). Is it not entirely consistent with classical theism to recognize the latter possibility with abduction? It is not obvious to me why not.      It seems that Dr. Feser's answer to this is that an abductive approach can only show causal links that are themselves contingent (""because the causal relationship between them, even if real, is going to be contingent."") It is not clear to me why Dr. Feser thinks it is the case that contingent arguments entail that the being argued for is itself contingent and this seems to me to get at the crux of the issue."

4348,theist,sceptic,"@Aron 1) Wow, you just buried yourself with your own arguments. If we can't even be sure we ourselves exist, and all knowledge / perception / thinking could just be false or irrational or even non-existent, then golly there can't be such a thing as justification either.      Certainly not individual but even less universal - other people could just not exist as well, or be illusions, or whatever. Even if other people existed, universal consensus or being convinced somethign is justified could also just as well be false or non-existent.      You should thereby become an absolute skeptic of everything.         2) As for self-awareness depending on memory...every single memory you have right now could just be false...but you'd still be aware you have those memories. All your beliefs could be false & illusory, yet you'd still have those beliefs.

So the view would be that there are moral norms of combination and overall norms of combination, both of which take into account exactly the same first order considerations, but sometimes come to different conclusions because they weigh the very same first order considerations differently (e.g., in the case where a moderate amount of _F_ -considerations needs to be sacrificed for a moderate amount of good for one’s children)."

3822,sceptic,theist,"It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work, then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St. Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example, that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy- basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground."

If it were possible to see the fifth dimension, we would be able to take note of similarities and differences between the world we occupy and a parallel world. Perhaps this is what our imagination does.

19,theist,sceptic,"Right-wing economic theories (e.g. von Mises, Hayek, Rand, etc…) are all based on the axiom that empathy is not necessary to build a sustainable society: that everyone could be a complete psychopath but as long as they're aware of their desires, can perform calculation and comparison and perform human action a flourishing society can be built. This is madness. In objective reality, empathy is the necessary and sufficient logical condition for building a sustainable society.      The conservative ""twist"" on right-wing economics that controlling external behavior (e.g. banning drugs, pornography, enforcing morality, etc...) can make up for an economic system without empathy is ludicrous.      People call communists atheists, but in objective reality right-wing economics is far more atheistic, because it presupposes that empathy is a mistake and it exists for no reason.

4768,theist,sceptic,"@Talmid      The same way classical theism and contingent knowledge go together. My open theism is based on the openness of the future (I agree with Pruss and many others that foreknowledge of free acts requires eternalism, but I am a presentist, so I reject foreknowledge of free acts). In other words: there is no difference at all in our views of God - I also believe that he must know every true fact. The difference between us is that I do not believe there are any true facts of what we will choose. Only what we choose or have chosen. So there is nothing for God to know there.      How can God ""learn"" what we choose without undergoing intrinsic change? The same way God can learn any contingent facts without undergoing intrinsic change. Classical theists believe God's knowledge of contingents is externalist and involves only Cambridge changes for him. You already have to believe that God's knowledge differs between worlds without that entailing any change in his intrinsic properties. Even with foreknowledge you have to believe that God only knows what you will do IFF God contingently creates you (unless you are a Molinist - which thomists reject - or you believe God creates of necessity). So you're on the same boat as me when it comes to having to account for God's contingent knowledge without real change. The only difference, again, is that I think there is nothing to know re: ""future choices"".      So no, open theism does not entail God being temporal. I wholeheartedly agree that God is outside of time. But unlike what some (very confused) thomists think, that does not mean that God can ""see the future"" as if there were anything to see there (unless, again, you are an eternalist/B theorist)."

1108,theist,sceptic,"But I cannot put dismiss Sergius Bulgakov’s suggestion that it is the world that allows Satan to entertain his delusion that God is not his true good. But eventually he will be expelled from the world and deprived of the world. He will no longer have the world to “feed” on. At this point “Satan’s duel with God begins,” Bulgavkov writes. “Can we, human beings, know anything about this duel?”"

1391,theist,sceptic,"Also:       _If the parts of a thing are merely potential, relative to the whole, then they cannot be ACTUALLY put together in the right way, as they would have to be in order to compose a whole._      Ed didn't _say_ that the parts are potential ""relative to the whole."" He said they are only potentially *independent* of the whole. It's right there in your first quote.      In other words, what makes an eye an eye is the role it plays in an organism (namely seeing), which it couldn't do if it weren't part of the whole. Yet at the same time, an eye is a *potentially* independent thing, inasmuch as it could be plucked out of an organism, in which case it would no longer be a part of the organism but an actually independent bit of matter without a biological function in its new context (and thus, technically, no longer an eye).      Again, this is just really basic and obvious stuff that you're going out of your way to misread. You've become like the mirror image of the [no- concessions policy of Darwinists](https://billdembski.com/intelligent- design/jason-rosenhouses-whoppers/) when talking to Ed."
2154,theist,sceptic,"(Continuation)      So not just it's unfair and wrong to say that ""this usage is common to Aristotle"" but one thing that I noticed in the book of both authors is the somewhat intentional sidestep or ""shell game"" of problems - like they were trying intentionally guide the book in a way to evade potential questions to their points. To be fair, Siderits tried to address some points of that (I do recommend the reading of the Chapter 4 since the most relevant discussion of points that could be related to our philosophy concentrates there). But his position simply gives me the impression that he tries to misplace the substance into its parts (like a shell game) and then comes to the conclusion that the substance could not exist. In responding to how accidents are always found in the substances (he does not use the term accidents, I'm using it to simplify) if they do not exist, he says:      ""Consider the water atom as an allegedly indivisible substance in which inhere the qualities of color, shape, wetness and mass. Resistance to the notion that these qualities may be thought of as its parts comes from the intuition that qualities do not simply float freely in the air, that they must be tethered to something that then explains their occurrence together with other qualities. Bundle theorists are typically asked to provide the principle of qualitative unity that would explain the co- occurrence of many qualities in the absence of a substance in which they inhere. The Buddhist bundle theorist says this is the wrong question to be asking. Instead we should ask why, in the absence of empirical evidence for the existence of substances as distinct from their properties, we nonetheless have the intuition that substances are required to explain qualitative unity."" (pp. 59)      To say that ""in the absence of empirical evidence"" is just to beg the question. but he goes on to say:      ""By hypothesis, color, shape, wetness, and mass tropes are compresent at a certain spatio- temporal location. This much both sides can agree on. Here is a possible explanation of the fact that we commonly take these to all be properties of a single thing, the water atom. When we wish to specify the location of this mass trope, it is easier to indicate it by using the term “water atom” than by indicating each of the three other tropes present at that location. This makes the communication process more efficient. It also relieves us of the burden of ascertaining just which other tropes are present at that location, given that we know from past experience that mass tropes are generally accompanied by other tropes in a certain range. “Water atom” functions as a convenient designator for a certain bundle of tropes (TS 832– 34; TSP ad TS 581– 83). That they make up a bundle has as much to do with us and our interests and cognitive limitations as it does with how things are in the   world. The world as it is anyway contributes the fact of their compresence. The rest— their being unified by their joint inherence in a substance— is our doing. The Buddhist doctrine of the two truths is their answer to the bundle theorist’s problem of unification.""      Basically, he uses their conventionalist position to ""explain"" how we construe substances from things that are nothing but tropes.      (I will continue)  "
4024,theist,sceptic,"@jmchugh:      ""You are absolutely certain that your religion's story of the creation and fall is true. I hold no such certainty.""      I have as much certainty that it is true as you have certainty that it is false. Your original question was framed as an alleged *contradiction*, you even used the words ""self-defeating and cruel"". Now you are changing tack in the middle of the conversation? At any rate, you have not found any fault with my arguments; your problem is just that they do not answer every question that you might reasonably ask -- I can live with that as I was not trying to answer every such reasonable question."

314,theist,sceptic,"@Laudator Temporis Acti      There is nothing about your objection that logically limits its application to matters of religion - if it were valid, it would remove the possibility of objective certainty in any field of knowledge, since any assertion we made would always require the implicit qualification, 'But since I am fallible, I could be wrong about this' (even about e.g. 2+2=4).      I'll mention in passing - the objection, thus taken to its logical conclusion, would therefore appear to be self-refuting, because the objector puts forward the objection itself as objectively certain truth (not qualifying it as 'merely probable').      But be that as it may, I will try to show that (whether or not its conclusion is self-refuting) the objection is a logical fallacy.      This is its basic structure:      It is possible for beliefs of mine to be false.   X is a belief of mine.   Therefore it is possible that X is false.      Consider the parallel argument:      It is possible for cats to be black.   Fluffy is a cat.   Therefore it is possible that Fluffy is black [even though I can see she is white].      The reason that these arguments fail is that I can be aware of more about Fluffy than the fact that she is a cat, and I can be aware of more about 'X' than the fact that it is a belief of mine. If all we knew about Fluffy was that she was a cat, then it would be reasonable to say that it was possible that she was black. And if all we knew about X was that it was a belief of my fallible self, then it would be reasonable to say that X was possibly false.      But in fact, I can know from the evidence of my senses that in Fluffy's case, the abstract possibility for cats to be black is not fulfilled in her particular case. And I can know from direct knowledge of conclusive logical or factual evidence in the particular case of X (e.g. 2+2=4), that the abstract general possibility of my beliefs being false is not fulfilled in the particular case of my belief X.      This is why the general fallibility that is ours as humans does not prove the impossibility of individuals reaching valid objective certainty in particular cases, where the individual is aware of sufficient evidence for the belief.      So there is no reason in principle why an individual, although fallible, might not discover sufficient evidence to ground a valid objective certainty (absolute certainty or reasonable moral certainty as the case may be) that e.g. '2+2=4', or 'The theory of relativity is true', or 'God has promised to protect from error a whole class of statements made by the pope in certain fairly well-defined circumstances'. One would need to examine the purported evidence in each case, but there is no reason in principle that it could not exist, despite our fallibility.      Justin (the 'Unknown' above)  "
