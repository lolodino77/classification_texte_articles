8721,positive,negative,"This is a MUST have for anyone who is not already protecting their system with a UPS Battery with AVR.<br /><br />I consider the APC P6W the next step below a highly rated UPS, because the unit shuts off when it has done its job and taken a hit in place of your equipment. That means it will NOT allow you to use the device any further, because it is now useless.<br /><br />What should that mean to the general public?<br /><br /> Everyone else's power surge units stay on AFTER the protection circuit has been fried. They do NOT shut off after burning out the protection fuse. If you think about it... that's a rip off for not offering such a feature!<br /><br />When I deliver computers to customers, I carry these with me and insist they buy one from me.. for piece of mind."
12619,positive,negative,"makes the crappy speakers in our TV turn themselves off with shame. Easy to install, gets loud, has some features other than this too. But this is already getting too wordy."

16791,positive,negative,"Received these yesterday and Have been trying them out since. After getting used to the different sound quality I am really enjoying them. There is a noticeable difference between the lows and highs. The only questionable issue I had was when trying them out for the first time the audio was garbled and scratchy with a background noise. This eventually went away after about 3-5 minutes of letting the audio play out. My guess to this could have been the headphones and the device syncing together to be compatible. It also could be the specific music app to play music files.<br /><br />After everything is said and done, I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality set of earphones."
762,positive,negative,"Very odd sound.  I use at my computer while at work, and the noise cancellation can't be shut off, so it always is running.  If i turn up the volume on my computer the speakers start popping (on my computer, even though the sound is coming out of my head phones).  If i press and hold the 'phone' button, the sound comes out perfect, but as soon as I let go of the button the sound goes back to a very weak/quiet sound that makes my speakers on my computer pop.  EDIT: Turns out it wont work correctly on the 'head phone' jack, but as soon as I plug it into the speaker jack, it works fine.  No more popping, and perfect sound quality."
28724,positive,negative,"This device is great....  I have had this for about 6 weeks now and is works as advertised.  We were getting 3 to 4 telemarketing, political and charity calls a day.  One by one as they called, I blocked their number.  We are now down to maybe a call once or twice a week now.  On one occasion I was away from the device, so I asked the caller to hold for a minute so I could go in my den and block their number. They actually held on until I pushed the button.  I thanked them for waiting and hung up. Since then, just for fun, I ask each caller to hold for a minute so I can block their number.  Oddly, they all stay on the line until I am able to press the button."
3193,positive,negative,"I have two different models of cree lights, each requiring a different battery.  Works great!"
20112,positive,negative,Bought for an upcoming trip based on reviews.  Will report on quality when I get back.
1791,positive,negative,"It's too bad that negative reviews for these products are left when they work perfectly for their purpose.  Buying something without educating yourself first, finding out it doesn't meet your needs, and then reviewing it badly is unreasonable.  It's not the product's fault you picked the wrong device.  I've used this particular unit for LCD projector connections and it works flawlessly.  It is pricey, but the quality is there."
13321,positive,negative,Works as advertised. I sent these to asia with a pair of panasonic link2cell phones. THey work great and not my parents dont miss our calls anymore.
9779,negative,positive,"I needed a holder for 2 batteries. But, there is no voltage at the wires."
22959,positive,negative,I used these in my motorhome to get an HDMI signal to the rear TV over existing coax.  They are expensive but the time it would have taken to run a new cable made it worth it.  Just be sure you have good BNC to coax adapters.  Also be sure that you force your source device to a resolution that the adapters can use.  The documentation is terrible and I was unable to make the IR adapter work.
8158,negative,positive,Not reliable
22723,positive,negative,Didn't work for me but I believe it is operator error. Exactly what was described is what I received.
10001,positive,negative,"This little device is perfect for what I wanted it for (listening to music/podcasts/youtube audio). When I went looking for a replacement for my Nextar model (they no longer make, which cost $9 and lasted 11 years), I had a set of features I wanted:  1. Dedicated volume buttons (want to be able to adjust volume without looking at the device or navigating a menu) 2. Wide format compatibility, FLAC, Org, MP3, etc... 3. FM radio 4. Voice recorder (also has FM recorder) 5. Pre-set EQ and Custom EQ ability 6. FF through a file, or RW through it (some devices only allow back to prev or fwd to next) 7. Rocker switches with easy controls, not buried in menus 8. Color screen to make it easier to navigate through folders and files, vs a single-line, monochrome LCD readout 9. Easily fit in the palm of my hand 10. Good battery life  This little gadget does ALL OF IT. It is not missing a single feature I wanted. I do not watch movies or game on it, but for what I do, it couldn't be better.  It also had something I wasn't expecting... Sansa provides firmware updates which is very nice. I already updated my firmware from 1.1.17 to 1.1.20. It was very simple to do and only took a second. Since the product has been discontinued the updates are already older but you can make sure you have the latest. (As an aside, the last fw version was 1.1.21 but it had some reported issues so I am sticking with 1.1.20.)  CONS: No time duration or countdown of the file shows in the play screen  This is subjective, but when listening to a file I would like the screen to show the full length in time, and the time left. It shows neither. Instead it has a progress bar, but you have no idea if the length of the bar represents 3 minutes or 3 hours without knowing the duration of the file. Instead you have to navigate to see info about the file, and here you can find the full length of it. Considering all the other features, I can live with this, but wish they'd done that one thing different.  As much asI like it, it became overpriced since they discontinued it and the stock started disappearing. I read a review that was written when this model was released, and the cost was $40. That sounds about right. I paid closer to $69, but it had everything I wanted, was rated as one of the top 5 players by most sources, and there weren't a lot of other choices. That said, if it lasts many years now, I am happy with the purchase and it's worth it. I don't know if it can be opened to replace the battery inside, but I suspect not. When the time comes I will give it a try.Hopefully the batt will have plenty of cycles on it.  Since it's annoying to me to have a device connected to my USB port, I use a USB/AC 1amp adapter made for charging devices off an AC plug, that are meant for a USB port. My device arrived 50% charged, and charged fully in 30min or so using the AC adapter. If you use an AC adapter be sure you use the right one, as the wrong adapter will fry the battery and could even cause it to melt or be a fire hazard. If in doubt, use your USB plug.  If this product is no longer available you can check out the Sport Clip, which has 25hr battery life vs 15hrs for the Zip Clip. However it was missing something I wanted that I can't remember now, that the Zip had, so that's why I went with the Zip."
20465,negative,positive,I bought this to use in an old convertible which is so classic that we can't switch out the am radio. We use it with our iPhone and the sound is great and loud for our purposes. It is also fairly small so it locks in the console which is nice too.  HOWEVER... stopped working with in year.... will not recharge....
25596,positive,negative,I had a pair of these but they were stolen a few years back.  Was happy to find them online.  Tokyo camera shipped them promptly and I received them in a weeks time from Japan.  This version is made in Thailand my original versions I had were made in Japan.  Still descent quality.  They are plastic so light weight and stay in place very well.
28028,negative,positive,"These ear buds are geared for the price conscious, but are probably at best good for a week. Maybe instead of including a velvet bag, strengthen the material used to protect the wire. I wasn't expecting them to last for a long time but on first use the sound was cutting in and out. They still work but are only going to be used as intermediate ear buds because they can't handle the stress of everyday use. Thank you."
9666,negative,positive,Only good for short runs. Do not expect to power motorized Axis cameras.
13069,negative,positive,Not all that it's made out to be system does not sound loud system does not reach desired length not happy
23983,positive,negative,"This review is for an Electrohome &#34;SelfSet Clock Radio&#34; model EAAC601, manufactured in June, 2015. Some of the earlier reviews posted must be for another model of clock radio because some of the criticisms mentioned do not apply to this model. As others have suggested, one should keep the instruction manual because while most of the buttons' functions are intuitive, some buttons have more than function depending whether it is briefly pushed or pushed-and-held (for 3 sec.) or used in conjunction with another button. This model is compact with a footprint of about 3.5 by 5.5&#34; and 4.5&#34; high. Clock screen brightness can be set to high, low or off by repeated pressing of a button. We use the low setting and the clock, which is within 1.5' of my face, does not disturb me. Changing the clock light intensity setting does not change the projected time brightness, which is a red image about 1' by 0.5' on an 8.5' ceiling. The projected clock image is composed of red bars, while the clock screen uses light blue/white dots on a medium dark blue background. We have no trouble reading the clock or projected time (without glasses) in a dark room. The clock radio arrived with a CR2032 button battery installed and functional, so when it is plugged in, the clock radio comes on with the correct time for the Eastern time zone (&#34;Time Zone 2 is the default&#34;). The clock can be easily adjusted for time zone and for optional daylight savings time. This is NOT an atomic clock even though the instruction book says it is &#34;equipped with &#34;auto time set&#34;&#34;. They mean that the clock comes set because of the internal battery, which holds time and radio information during a black out or when the clock is unplugged. I do not tested to determine if a set alarm would function during a blackout.  The screen and projected time are not visible when unplugged. This clock is clearly manufactured for the Canadian market because time zones and daylight savings time are mentioned for provinces, but it is no problem adjusting for US locations. This clock radio operates on 110-120V AV only, not 220V or battery. The radio's sound is reasonable for a speaker this size and is clear and static free. Because we are in a tight valley in the Blue Ridge Mountains and the walls are 1.75' solid concrete, radio reception in the house is poor. Even with a high quality radio, usually we get 1 local AM station and no FM stations, so I cannot address on the radio's sensitivity. Dialing is done by either an &#34;up&#34; or &#34;down&#34; button. The radio has  20 presets, 10 AM and 10 FM, indication that it has a digital tune (not analog tuned by a rotary knob as some reviews state. In dialing one sees the stations' id. numbers, but once set, the station id. does not appear on the screen. This may be a problem for some people because one is less likely to know what station is playing until the station identifies itself.<br />So far (having used it only 3 days) we are completely pleased with this clock radio and recommend it highly."

27505,positive,negative,Most of the buttons on the front of my Lite-On DVD recorder no longer work so I ordered this as a backup remote because if the original remote  quits working I am screwed. I couldn't even turn the unit on.  I tested this remote and it works fine.  It gives me some peace of mind knowing I'll still be able to use the recorder if the first remote dies.
28622,positive,negative,the item was as desribed but i ordered the wrong cable can i retrun it for a refund ?
9210,positive,negative,"It was time to face facts. I ripped all my CDs years ago, and listen to them exclusively through my iPhone. Any new music is either purchased electronically, or streamed. But something about all the years of collecting and the the thousands of dollars spent made it hard for me to part with my giant beloved storage rack full of CDs. But seeing that they served no purpose, and trying to clear up the clutter, I decided to compromise, and at least dispose of the bulky jewel cases.<br /><br />Based on reviews, I went ahead and ordered one of these in each color. I'm very happy with them. In fact, I ordered one more for my DVDs. They are big. They hold 500+ discs, so that's to be expected. However, the sheets are separated inside into a series of relatively flat plastic bindings, rather than just one big ring. This allows the pages to lay flatter when the book is open, and to turn very easily. The handle is very sturdy. Its a hard plastic and sticks out. This could be a negative depending on where you are storing them, but I don't mind. Some reviewers mentioned that the disks tend to fall out easily. I found that the top outside discs (4 per side per sheet) occasionally slide part way out when you flip the pages quickly. None ever actually fell out completely. You simply need to push them back down into place. I personally prefer them a little loose, as they are less likely to scratch up the disks than if you had to really force them down in there. I had no issues with the plastic cut outs not being removed as some have mentioned. I think I found 3 total in the 4 cases (so 2000+ slots). Besides, they are cut and simple to remove. I'd highly recommend these cases if you have a lot to store."
2602,positive,negative,They fit my big head..lol
20193,negative,positive,"Awful product, these air dusters have been ruined with the addition of bitters, all brands seem to use the same anti abuse measures so I don't know how much it will vairy from brand to brand but I don't remember using these air dusters (mainly dust off brand) and ever having a layer of chemicals left over after using them which makes me think its completely a bi product of the addition of bitters. Definitely a 1 star product, the next day after use of this product about 30 minutes after using my keyboard and washing my hand my sandwich was contaminated with bitters from my fingers. I will say though that the strength of the bitters goes down with use of the product. When you first use it its so strong it fills the air and you get the bitters taste in your mouth, very unpleasant. Also it says you shouldnt ever use this product on camera lenses, well if I shouldn't use this to blow dust away from a camera lenses why would I want to use this on my 4k monitor or any of my electronics for that matter ?_?"

29980,positive,negative,Fits desktop computer
15452,negative,positive,"This speaker is OK, not fantastic.  I bought a cheaper one from Bed Bath & Beyond that had better sound and cost less.  When this product is turned all the way up there is a slight buzz - sound isn't totally clear.  The cord on the bottom is super short - maybe an inch long.  I would not suggest this to anyone. The only thing I love about it is the color.  Upon arrival, I plugged it in and it lasted about 4 min before it ran out of batteries.  I charged it over night and it still isn't fuly charged.  Waste of money in my opinion."
10579,positive,negative,not very loud but expecting almost as it is.
22678,positive,negative,"I bought one of these for my boyfriend and was immediately struck by how good the sound is, especially for something so small, and especially especially for something so rugged. I have the larger Ecogear rugged speaker, and the sound is pretty much the same.<br /><br />Quality alone would make me recommend this speaker over any other, but the customer service blew me away. We lost a part and when I called in to see if I could buy me a replacement they told me to send the whole thing in and they'd fix it for free under it's 3 year warranty. Customer service picked up the phone quickly, with minimal phone tree necessary, immediately emailed me the needed paperwork, and then emailed me updates for the speakers as they were working on it. I have never in my life had such a pleasant interaction with customer service. They've been pretty much fantastic."

12554,positive,negative,"This switch, along with other supporting items ordered met all of my expectations. Thus, I give a 5-star rating."
13033,negative,positive,I don't see much channels after installation.  I don't see it is better than other brands.
11315,negative,positive,It hard to program and set local and international times as well as turn to local radio stations.

17882,positive,negative,"Received this unit last week. I first thought it might be used because of the scratches on the control panel. My wife & I both l examined it to see if it had a protective plastic covering but did not see any edges. Emailed TK to complain - They responded almost immediately to ensure the unit did indeed have a protective covering over the control surface.  We looked again and it did indeed have a barely perceptible clear plastic covering - Unit was flawless. It came with a hands-free headset mic, charger, shoulder-strap, and carrying case.<br /><br />The quality of the speaker is amazing! Whether the input is voice, mp3, or FM, it is clear and crisp at any volume...And believe me, this unit will project at LOT of volume. It comes fully charged and provides 10+ continuous hours per charge.  My born-again Friends and I will use it for outdoor evangelizing and look forward to drawing a crowd to hear the Gospel of God's Grace; the message of Salvation which comes through repenting of our sins and placing our faith in Jesus Christ alone as Lord & Savior...And to God be the Glory!"

2617,negative,positive,"I have purchased Sennheiser headphones because I don't do well with earbuds (they don't stay in my ears while I run) but they consistently fall apart. I love love love the style and the head phones fit my ears perfectly. The wire right where it connects to my I pod consistently breaks and the plastic comes apart. I had these particular headphones in the box for a long time and recently opened it up. I had them for ONE day, the ear piece completely fell apart and once again, that spot right where it connects to my I pod is showing the wire already. I wanted to love these but I will never purchase from Sennheiser again. The price does not reflect quality."

3799,positive,negative,"Design: Fairly flexible, four 18 gauge individually insulated wires, plus one non-insulated &#34;drain&#34; wire wrapped in a shielding foil.<br /><br />Purpose: The foil wrapper acts as a receiver for electromagnetic interference (EMI) which can play havoc in sensitive electronics that the cables may be connected between.  The non-insulated drain wire is connected AT ONE END to a common ground plane to give the EMI a place to go, rather than into your electronics.  The foil makes contact with the drain wire constantly throughout the length of the cable.<br /><br />The wiring metallurgy itself seems to be decent quality.  It does appear to be pure copper, and thus a bit more pricey on the hierarchy of price options on Amazon, but it is not brittle like copper clad aluminum (CCA) wire and will not experience the complications that CCA wire can face.<br /><br />My Use: I have used this personally to replace the non-shielded wiring that came with my laser cutter.  The 50,000 volt laser puts off a fierce amount of EMI that would sink into the wiring for the motors, and more irritatingly, the travel endstop switches.  The EMI would cause the computer to think that an endstop switch was triggered, resulting in an emergency stopping of the laser cutter.  After the upgrade to this wiring, I have had no further false triggerings after 100+ hours of laser firing.<br /><br />I further plan to use this wiring to replace the non-shielded 20 gauge wiring on my Shapeoko 2 CNC mill which should help eliminate some issues with too small of wiring that I did originally.<br /><br />There are many levels of shielding you can find for wiring (foil, double foil, copper braid, double copper braid, copper braid + foil, etc, etc) but this basic level of shielding should work for virtually all your DIY projects unless you are getting into some seriously sensitive hardware."
10809,negative,positive,"I'm not an audiophile.  In my opinion, these iem's are the best you can get in this price range.  They are very light.  If you get a good seal, they have plenty of bass.  I also owned the AKG Q701's and some Senn HD518.  I compared them to the entry level shure 2 series iem's and I thought the shure's were too heavy (in comparison).<br /><br />Edit: Feb '16<br />The headphone jack connection is faulty.  I should have mailed it in for warranty but I thought I could just splice the wires with another headphone jack to save myself the hassle.  The wires are way too small to fix."

If the bluetooth device it's paired to (in my case my phone or Ipod) is resting on a table while let's say I'm moving around the house, it doesn't seem to cut out at all.

14964,negative,positive,Badly designed product. The screws that are required and ironically included in the hardware kit are too thick for the holes that attach the mount to the TV. Do not purchase if you are intending to mount a Samsung TV.

I did double check my drives and both say they are Dual Layer DVD+R compatible."
15259,negative,positive,All mislabeled cables - Ordered trs cables - rec'd mono -  mislabeled cables see pics
16591,negative,positive,"Stop looking at the negative reviews, although I believe nothing is without flaw, these are nearly. The semi-open design is awesome if you want to play games but not loose all the atmosphere, and music has hreat highs, okay mids, and fantastic bass, not to a bass head level, mind you, but enough to still enjoy the sounds of the music. They are built like a gunship, lightweight design, looks cool, rugged, and although not as good at certain things as a full-open design nor closed, they are a nice mid for someone like me who just wants one pair of headphones that I can play games and listen to music with, and they are fantastic for that. Everyone stares that the ear ups are not removable and if that's something your into, find some other pair, but I can assure you, you're missing out on a great deal! And the stock ear ups are great. Clamping force is a little high for my tastes, but after a few weeks, you tend not to notice and it loosens up. All in all 89/100"
16176,positive,negative,very nice compared to the ones available in radio shack. much better and much more affordabe. do beware when you hook them up if you smell any odor of something burning unplug it and throw it away or try to get a refund as it did happen to me one time out of four purchases. nothing was on fire but as i plugged things into it i started to smell something burning and some smoke coming out of the unit. i just threw it away and got another one and no problem. i have four of them in my room now.not sure what was wrong with the bad one.
27137,negative,positive,"I would not buy these again.  I wanted ear phones that wrapped around my ears and stayed in place while working out or that didn't get ripped out of my ears when i put my motorcycle helmet on.  I lost the pair that I used to use, which was a $6 pair from Walmart.  These had good reviews so I took the chance.  Audio isn't awful, but definitely not great either.  People who say these have good bass have never owned a quality pair of ear phones before.  These do not have good bass.  They don't fit my ears very well with the included adapters (yes, i tried all the sizes - but one of the sizes which happens to be the one I think would have worked best, is squished flat and therefore doesn't fit my ear well).  Also, i HATE that these have a memory cord that is flexible that goes over your ear and that you have to reform that over your ear each time you put these on.  might work well for some people, but it takes me several minutes to get these reasonably comfortable.  maybe not that long to some but that's just annoying to me.  i know $18 isn't a ton of money for ear phones, but it is to me considering all the great sounding pairs I've bought recently for under $10/pair.  these just aren't good....<br /><br />these are going in my junk drawer and may never get used again.  back to walmart to find another $6 pair of what i used to use."

10880,negative,positive,Attached the Juice amplifier to my Antennas Direct DB4e antenna per included instructions; result was significant signal reduction. I found this quite surprising as the DB4e antenna is an excellent product I would highly recommend to anyone; I expected the amplifier to be of similar quality.
12536,negative,positive,"Not worth a penny. almost inaudible sound.<br />I'm not upset though, it was very cheap!"
3858,positive,negative,Make sure the volume is up on ur ipod when u use this product. I thought the speakers sucked at first but my volume just wasn't up lol. There is a slight humming/buzzing noise in between changing songs. Hard to press bottoms sometimes. But acceptable. 5 stars
6657,positive,negative,"I'd like to state first and foremost that I did receive a sample product from Vtin for review purposes. I was not given any incentive to provide a 5-star or even a positive review for this item. Vtin makes quality products and wanted my critical, honest opinion on what they could do to improve their product as well as an informative review for their customers.<br /><br />I initially wanted this adapter because my laptop had an HDMI output and I wanted to hook it up to an (older) projector to display baby pictures for my wedding. I had the slideshow all prepared and ready, but when we started setting things up at the reception hall, it turns out their projector didn't have any HDMI input.<br /><br />I went ahead and ordered the Vtin HDMI to VGA converter and got it just in time! I plugged this into the HDMI port in the laptop and within about 1 minute it detected another display output device. I plugged the VGA port from the projector into the Vtin VGA port and I was up and running!<br /><br />Display quality was quite good and I had no issues with flickering or unresponsiveness on the screen that was plugged into the adapter. Setup was a breeze and I couldn't have asked for anything better, especially given the pricepoint.<br /><br />I'd recommend this unit for anyone that needs to extend the capabilities of the HDMI port on a laptop, or any other device that just needs VGA input."
26106,positive,negative,"Before you buy these, really consider if they'll be long enough. they weren't even long enough to connect 2 things on the same shelf of my entertainment center, right next to each other. I had to send these back and get 1.5ft cables. But I can't fault them, it was my mistake!"
550,negative,positive,"It did not fit into the player, and the player is the exact number advertised."
16737,positive,negative,should have bought 2!!
25649,positive,negative,"This was the only mount that would allow my TV to go LOWER than where I could attach the mount to the wall. Advise, don't try to compress the strust by hand, they might just slip and spring open with your finger in a hinge part. Those are serious struts and take a good amount of strength to compress, which also means it can hold a good weight tv."

4884,negative,positive,"Product arrived in a used, not new, condition. It's scuffed and has black marks on the cord. Operates fine, and as it's going behind a cabinet, the aesthetics aren't critical, but feel pretty cheated for getting a used product at a new product price."
23754,positive,negative,"Does what it says it does, received it within the time frame described by the seller"
28531,positive,negative,"Works Great. I am very glad I bought it.  I had never replaced these batteries before and I thought the plastic on the terminals, it has plastic to protect them, was unremovable.  I didn't know you remove these.  So it was very confusing for me.  I thought they had sent me the wrong battery.  After I removed them, everything else was a piece of cake."

10221,positive,negative,"Very good, maybe a bit too warm on ears, but it's around 100 here, so I guess it'll be better when it becomes colder :))<br />Big enough and covering ears fully."
2034,negative,positive,"I guess these headphones aren't the worst made, so they may not deserve 1 star. But positive reviews are so extreme nowadays, giving pretty good products 5-stars, I rated them this way to balance things out. I am not an audiophile, but I enjoy music very much. It's hard to know which earbuds to choose, since you really can't try before you buy. I am pretty happy with the Panasonic buds that were about $7, but I wanted to spend a bit more money to see if I could find sound a little better, richer.  These are definitely not better; instead much worse. They are heavy on the bass, but the bass sounds like it's coming from the blown out subwoofer cranked to 10 in a 16-year-old's car.  All other frequencies are just muddled. I'd love to find a really nice set of buds for about $50 - buds that sound significantly better than the Panasonics. these are definitely not the ones."
7107,negative,positive,"I purchased this antenna without realizing it was an &#34;amplified&#34; antenna until after the purchase. If I had noticed it at first, I wouldn't have ordered it.<br /><br />Here's why:<br /><br />Amplifiers on TV antennas don't significantly improve the capability for you to view a TV channel. Sure, you will probably see a stronger &#34;Signal Strength&#34; for all your channels. Maybe you will even see more channels listed (I didn't). But, the important thing is being able to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) - which boosts your TV signal without raising the background noise level at the same time. I haven't found an inexpensive TV antenna amplifier yet that does this. All the TV antenna amplifiers I have used (including this one) have all boosted the noise and the signal at the same time, and the amplified channels are still as unwatchable as when they are unamplified.<br /><br />Think about it this way: If this simple amplification would improve the TV reception for all channels, why don't they put this amplification in all HDTVs? (Note: There is some signal amplification and heavy signal processing done in all HDTVs to extract the TV signal, but the real work is done by the signal processing)<br /><br />Here's a good example: I live 25 miles from the transmitting towers for my metro area. Even with using the amplification, I only picked up 34 channels with the 1byone. My recommended antenna (below) gets 45 channels unamplified. Both antennas were pointed in the same direction by using my compass.<br /><br />In summary: This &#34;60 Mile Antenna&#34; amplified 1byone antenna is a cheaper antenna attached to an amplifier to compensate, and certainly isn't usable as a realistic 60 mile antenna.<br /><br />Now, to the antennas I DO recommend, sold by Amazon. These directional, unamplified antennas by Antennas Direct did a much better job for me:<br /><br />http://amzn.com/B0017O3UHI (UHF Only)<br />http://amzn.com/B007RH5GZI (VHF + UHF)<br /><br />You will want to check in your area to see if you have VHF HD channel broadcasts. While most HDTV channels are broadcast via UHF frequencies, some are broadcast over VHF frequencies. In my metro area, there are two major broadcasters that use VHF. That will determine which of the two antennas above you should consider buying.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Antennas Direct antennas are a bit more expensive, but this is a one-time purchase, so I'm OK with that.want to check in your area to see if you have VHF HD channel broadcasts.

26817,negative,positive,Sounds OK but can't handle any serious boom. Bought a kicker that blows this one away. I suggest spend a couple more bucks on a different speaker....unless you like replacing them a lot!!!

11827,positive,negative,"My model was refurbished. I've been a strict user of Kindle Paperwhite but since I started buying some books in the epub format it seemed easier to buy the NOOK rather than go through all the tedium to read the books on Kindle.<br /><br />The NOOK GLOWLIGHT is rather nice. It's a bit klunky where the Kindle Paperwhite is smooth but that is just something to get used to. My NOOK, I can't say for anyone else, must be always connected to the internet to work. I can't do that with my Kindle because as soon as it is connected performance is slowed down. The NOOK does not slow down. Wonderful.<br /><br />Two other positives:<br /><br />Kindle Paperwhite: to read one 364 page book I had to re-charge the battery at page 227.<br />Not on internet. Light set to 15.<br />Nook Glowlight: I was able to read 3 books of at least 300 pages each before I had to re-charge the battery.<br />Always on internet. Light set to half."

27188,positive,negative,I bought these back in 2011 for below 100 dollars (can't and would not pay the current price right now on amazon). These lasted a good four years. Probably the most comfortable headphones I've owned(like pillows on your ears).  Heavy basgood enough sound quality for me(heavy bass music).
21025,negative,positive,"I bought this item to power a little O2 COOL portable fan I have that worked well on two D size batteries for years. It was still working well when I plugged it in to this piece of junk. I left it unattended for a half an hour and now my fan will only start running on two new D cell batteries, if I slap it against the palm of my hand a couple of times.<br />I'm hesitant to buy another &#34;better&#34; one for fear of a repeat performance."

10643,negative,positive,"This unit was to replace a Onkyo TX-SR 803 that was dying.  The 803 was ten yrs old  and no problems until recently. With the longevity  and great sound of the 803 I decided  to go with Onkyo again........bad move, the sound was horrible, did not play well with my Harmony remote, unit kept changing input setting  on it's own,room correction  is the worst. So, after two weeks of fighting this not ready for prime receiver back it goes. I ordered a Marantz SR 7008 and Emotiva XPA-3 GEN 2. Unbelievable sound and easy set up."
92,negative,positive,"Honestly, I wish I could rate this speaker more positively, but let me explain my experience with the Magicbox II.<br />I have music playing nearly constantly when I am home and the Magic Box II makes listening to music so amazingly convenient. Pairing to the bluetooth is incredibly simple and quick, it holds great charge (I feel like i charge it every few days with moderate use), and it gets decently loud. My main issue with this product is sound quality, but first let's talk about sound level.<br />When I was considering buying this product I was really curious about how loud does it get, I'll try to answer that.<br /><br />Sound Level: Its perfect for personal use, but you definitely are not hosting a big party with just this little speaker and granted that is not the intended use. Chilling in my room, doing dishes, hanging out outside, in these situations I have been more than satisfied with the sound level and do not need to play it at Max volume. I've tried listening to this speaker while driving in my car and I did not feel like it had the power to overcome road noise (then again I drive an older car that might be noisier than newer sound proofed models).<br />I downloaded Sound Meter from the android app store (not sure how accurate it is) and it measures max volume at ~80 decibels<br /><br />Sound Quality: Sound quality is actually why I am considering returning this product, and note I am not some an audiophile with extremely high quality demands. I have been using my Magicbox II for about a month now and I have noticed an irritating distortion/static in lower mid-tones, It becomes increasing noticeable when the volume is louder. This distortion gives music an unclear, staticky, somewhat muffled sound. I am not positive if it was always there and I am only now becoming sensitive to it, or if I have a defective speaker and this distortion developed. This issue is noticeable when using Aux cord and bluetooth.<br />When doing a Frequency Sweep test from 1-100hz the noise is most prominent from 25hz and up."

Haven't found anything on warranty or support yet..."
26677,positive,negative,I bought this as a Christmas  gift for my boyfriend and let me tell you he is now glued to the Tv! This system has superior sound and you won't be disappointed. We even use it to play music.  It has so much bass that on low my neighbors upstairs came knock on my door!

20935,negative,positive,"I hate it. I have a Masters degree and programming it is beyond my capabilities. I bought it at Target, not on Amazon. I like to wake to NPR in the morning. Is that so much to ask? The snooze button is challenging to hit. This thing is the devil."

12228,positive,negative,"I got Logitech Bluetooth Audio Adapter last year but had to return it due to bad streaming audio quality. Apparently it was due to the fact that it was using older Bluetooth 3.0 protocol. There was constant delay in video playing on laptop and audio being played on speakers via Logitech Bluetooth adapter. It was quite a frustrating experience and i had to eventually return it.   This BOSE Audio adapter uses latest Bluetooth 4.0 protocol. It is totally awesome and does not have any kind of issues streaming &#34;real time&#34; audio from Laptop, Macbook, iPad, iPhone and my Android phone.   Totally worth few extra bucks !!."

Now these are for products:<br /><br />Bluetooth features are excellent: easily paired and sound quality is good.<br /><br />The design of headset is far from user friendly not to mention it's too BIG to hang on walking and needlessly exercising. It's a challenging to find great positions to have it performing intended function.<br /><br />Now I need to pay my shipping back to China that is almost half price of this headset. Shame on you.

13260,negative,positive,"We ordered these headphones because my son loves ninja turtles and the color of the headphones was perfect, however when the headphones arrived....they were a different color all together and not anything like the picture"
12723,negative,positive,First of all this is amazing headphones great sound and confortable but the only thing is the audio jack and are made of very cheap material. Now i couldn't hear any thing !!
12769,positive,negative,I finally found the one. I was ready to give up on this tv nothing would pair with it this remote worked right out of the box.
13741,positive,negative,Just want we wanted. I could only find replacements on Amazon.com or we would of had to purchase a whole new set. This was a way better option and my husband is very happy.
18168,positive,negative,"Bought this as a replacement for lost remote. Works well,and was much cheaper here than on the actual Bose site."
12022,negative,positive,The form is great and lows are great. But there is some SERIOUS DSP distortion happening in this box. Some sort of digital limiting that creates an almost constant crackling in the highs. Listen closely enough and you will hear it.

7427,negative,positive,"NOT what I needed, even though it says it is"
21497,negative,positive,"Wow, great for the price. To start, in my opinion these look great. Its real metal yes. The bass on these are pretty good, but don't expect ultra crispy vocals. The the best thing for me that really set it apart for me was the carrying case, which is actually really good. They also have this yellow Velcro strip to tie them and get them into the case. Would buy again.   Update 11/7/15  This product is absolutely terrible and i am starting to hate it. The &#34;metal&#34; mesh circles on the back side of the earbuds fell off. The mesh is just glued onto the earbuds. Other parts of the metal mesh are starting to uplift and they are stabbing my fingers and my thigh when in my pocket. I have bleed. Sound quality is actually pretty poor now that i compare them to other earbuds.the little black rubber stops the connect the earbuds to the wire has slide down the entire length of the cable. I am also convinced that these are shocking me because on occasion i will get a stinging pop in my ear as if i got zapped. Want money back. DO NOT BUY"
15510,negative,positive,"Freaking knockoff! I've owned the real version of this speaker and it was awesome. Easily 5 stars. Unfortunately I lost it but liked it so much I wanted to replace it. The one they sent me came in a box branded &#34;hisense&#34; although the speaker itself has the x-mini badging on the rubber pieces. My fist clue was turning on the speaker and have a robot lady say &#34;Bluetooth mode&#34; extremely loud. My old speaker never did that. Also the status lights are different colors. This knockoff does not work as a Bluetooth receiver as my original did. Also it won't remember my phone if I turn the speaker off and on again. It feels cheaper and the sound quality is not as good as my original. After waiting a month to get this from China, I'm really not happy. I feel tricked. I hope x-mini sues the jerks making these. A-holes."

My husband managed to vacuum up my original pair and I loved them so much that I wanted another pair just like them.  While these look the same, I wonder if they are a knock off or maybe returned.  First of all, they didn't come in the packaging that the pair that I bought at the expo came in.  Those came in a nice box with a larger size of headphone covers and a nice blue bag for putting them in.  Off of this site, I got one set of headphones with only the small headphone covers (I'm happy that I still had my larger size covers from my originals or these would have been too small).  There was no box, no nice instructions, just a plastic bag.  Seems a bit shady to me."

13726,negative,positive,"The best IEMs money can buy. Better than custom UEs, anything by Shure. I haven't tried the AKG 3003i though. Easy ear placement. No annoying wrap around ear wires. If it comes out then get larger size buds. Just listen for yourself. I'm just using iPhone 6+. Listening to Spotify extreme and Tidal. You can tell the difference with Tidal. I couldn't with the IE80i You can get the DCS 800 microphone lead if you want also.  REVISED. There has been a problem with these earphones and Sennheiser has refused to repair the earphones without charge. This is disgraceful. The headphones were bought from an authorized dealer and 100% genuine."
22576,positive,negative,"Is what it is, works."
21674,positive,negative,would recommend
22758,negative,positive,"Great size. Good mid-range sound quality. I really like the rubberized top, bottom and button strip... easy to grip and makes me want to bounce it on the ground (no, don't do that).<br /><br />I've had about a dozen bluetooth speakers. Several are better than this when it comes to sound quality but this one is higher than all but the UE Roll [[ASIN:B00YARCGHO UE ROLL 360 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker  -  Volcano]]<br /><br />As for the light show, I guess it might put me in a trance if I were really stoned or something. The lights don't pulse with the music, like the light shows I used to help put on in the late 1960s and early 1970s... it is no Fillmore West or East... but it can be mildly interesting. Several levels of brightness.<br /><br />UPDATE: Now it has begun sounding like a loud bowl of Rice Krispies... lots of snap, crackle and pop. I'd like to assume this is a highly unusual defect... but I can't, so beware.<br /><br />Another update: The snap, crackle, pop goes away if put the speaker on very low volume -- so, it might work for you if you are sitting right next to it."

9558,negative,positive,I have the mini life jacket 2 and have had the exact problem others have mentioned. The USB dongle fell inside of the speaker and I now have an expensive brick. Worked great until then
7505,negative,positive,"Product itself is great so far. Item was not delivered as specified. MISSING HANDLEBAR MOUNT! So I'm very disappointed! Searched to get it for a good price, to put on my bike (motorcycle). Now I have no MOUNT which was the second reason I got it for, was the MOUNT option............."
11731,positive,negative,"Wish I could give this no stars. The only thing great about this pair of ear buds is the look. I bought these for my son to wear while working out. The very FIRST time he used them, one side stopped working. Would not recommend and would not buy again. Just wish I could get my money back.   Updat: I received a call from the company and the gladly sent a replacement pair. There is a 1 year warranty on the ear buds. I teceived the replacement pair and my husband has been using them at the gym ever since. He advises that he has had no problems with the sound and is very happy with them. Overall, the customer service is impeccable and it turns out that the first pair received was a dud."

13729,positive,negative,"The booster button on the left headphone speaker, really, really make a difference in tooning out any other noises. My roomates like to argue, so I just put these on flip the boost button, put on Pandora and forget about all that racket."
6377,positive,negative,"Worked as Described. For a few cents more I got Belkin, a name you can trust."

28459,negative,positive,"This just allows you to connect your Wii using the HDMI input on your TV. The resolution still sucks. I bought another one from Fry's for about $40 and that actually enhances the graphics. Really didn't want to pay that much, but worth it."
2342,positive,negative,I had the previous model with batteries and this is much better.  I use it strictly for golfing and re-charge it every time I play.  No problems with not having enough charge and the sound quality is much better.
24400,negative,positive,It was just what I wanted and works well. The only station near is fm.  Thanks.

501,positive,negative,"Lots of outlets.  Saves my as-s when the power flickers or goes out as I can save my work before the CPU dies.  That's what you want a UPS to do, right?"
19035,negative,positive,"Love the speaker, but we have been through 4 in a year!!!<br />The charge port keeps breaking!!!!<br />The company will not return out calls for help and Verizon says they won't replace it again.<br />Great speaker that we can't charge 😡😡😡😡"
25276,positive,negative,"After I tried to buy this earbuds in many places, (with no success or fake ones) this was the only place were I could find a truly original set of Sony E10LP. I love them, I buy one every year, they last long. Recommended."
28528,positive,negative,"Exceptional range - I would recommend this unit to anyone.  I also installed the Titan 2 Pre-AMP which put the icing on the cake.  The customer got 55 channels in High Def.  I originally installed a unit which claimed to reach 150 miles (totally untrue) - I had to remove that unit with this one.<br /><br />I am an experienced installer from &#34;back in the day&#34; -  so I knew how to put it together, but the instructions for the average person was not thought out for the homeowner type."

19507,negative,positive,"I have been using this for several months now. Yes, it looks cheaper than the $100 price you pay. No, it is never advertised as a pair of closed, noise-cancelling or boom-box-like headphones, and so other 1-star reviewers should educate themselves about headphones before complaining.  I consider myself an entry-level audiophile and own a pair of AKG headphones besides HD558 for high-end listening. I bought the HD558 for easy listening, like MP3, YouTube, news and occasionally high-end listening as well. At the time of purchase, I compared the HD558 against HD518, and found the former produce crispier mid-range and treble. HD518 can also be musical after it has broken in, but its bass though deeper interferes invasively with the mid-range, and so you cannot make out as clearly what a human voice is saying. The sound of HD558 is pleasant, and you can clearly hear each separate note in violin play such as Mendelssohn's Violin Concertos performed by Kyung Wha Chung.  Then why did I just give these headphones a harsh one-star rating? Just as another 1-star reviewer commented, the ear cups have inside them an irremovable plastic protrusion that would push against the tip (a sensitive part) of your ears, and annoy the hell out of me. It is probably designed as part of the acoustic structure, but it makes the headphones uncomfortable and irritating to wear, even for a few seconds. I have got to the point where I want to throw them into the garbage bin (or give them to someone with small ears like their designers) in spite of their sound quality. So, I think I might as well do you a favor and warn you against making the same mistake. Wait for deals on other headphones elsewhere,"
9100,negative,positive,Did not work.  For the price not shocked.
21565,negative,positive,"The Good:<br />Great bass in fact fantastic bass.  Midranges are clear and crisp.  At 60 years old, I'm no longer qualified to comment on the high end.<br />Good fit.  Not quite the fit I get with the 3 flange Shures or Etimotycs, but good.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Terrible Bluetooth connectivity.  The limit to avoid dropouts seems to be no more than 8 inches.  I couldn't even leave my iPhone in my pants pocket and listen to music.  By contrast, my Sony allowed  me to leave my iPhone on my patio and mow my yard, (40 feet).<br /><br />The Verdict<br />Depending on JLabs support response, they will probably go back."
9579,negative,positive,no sound after 3 years.  appears to be a popular problem.
2061,positive,negative,Not bad.
6390,negative,positive,It just didn't hold a charge. It was great for less than 45mins. I wouldn't recommend this speaker at all. At best it is an overpriced paperweight.
8815,negative,positive,"These earbuds are as cheap as the price. They feel like a child's toys and sound like them too. I really wanted these to be great after reading all of these reviews that stated how wonderful they were. The ones like &#34; I'm a real audio snob, and I tested these against XYZ brand and I found these to be superior&#34;. Baloney!<br /><br />The bass is ok but it's like the whole sound is muffled. Also there is a ton of crackling when I try to use them to talk on the phone. I have to switch back to my Apple earbuds if I want to have a conversation and not get the other party pulling their hair out in frustration.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and spend the extra bucks on a nicer pair, because you will end up doing that if you buy these anyway. Plus I should have read the description better. There are NO VOLUME CONTROLS."
23207,positive,negative,The original battery in my Logitech Harmony 900 would no longer hold a charge. This battery fit perfectly and holds charge as expected. The only downside is we now regularly lose the remote (again) now that we don't have to constantly return it to the charger!
10241,negative,positive,I never used it. The printer had other problems.
6425,negative,positive,The USB plugs were all defective. None of them would charge. It looks great and is exactly what I wanted (configuration-wise).  I really wanted this to work.
18423,positive,negative,Excellent product and nothing was broke.
17103,negative,positive,It was way below my except expectations. Audio qualirlty is not what I expected
29543,positive,negative,"they hit hard just make sure you know what your amp can do as Ohms is Very important when getting these speakers to hit, and they hit hard when you have a decent subwoofer to work with... and you need to know the grilles are not made to be removed they are glued in and  not really designed to be replaced but they can be removed... the mounting equipment is all there but the instructions are not you gotta wing it or google ir if your feeling lucky. i use them on my bike trailer and hold them down with bungee cords."
12273,negative,positive,"While they fit in the headpiece, they are very loose. This causes a lot of wobbling when you wear the entire earpiece. Not happy with these."
14469,positive,negative,An excellant product.
17299,negative,positive,They just didn't fit right and the sound was not so good
27820,positive,negative,"They really improved the model.  The annoying hum from the previous one is mostly gone, and they don't keep cutting out at low volumes.  Extremely happy with these."
17605,positive,negative,These cables are well built and last.  High cost hdmi cables dont get you better picture and cheap ones fall apart.  These are just right.
993,negative,positive,It would be a nice desktop charger but it is a strange animal.  Seems that you can't use the power outlet and the USB outlets at the same time. It will not charge my Samsung tablet at all.  Not sure what the switch does.
25107,negative,positive,I don't recommend.
905,negative,positive,"Using this splitter, I could watch my DirecTv on another TV, but not two TVs at the same time."

12425,negative,positive,"I loved this soundbar - up until it just died on me. It barely lasted a year and now it is one big expensive paper weight. Not okay. I treat my electronics very well and I expected to have this for years to come. Very disappointing. Will not be buying from Pioneer again, I expected a lot more from them. Bluetooth was always a bit funny too, but I never minded that much."
5128,positive,negative,right what i need.quality perfect.really thin.
10865,negative,positive,Don't have any thing nice to say about it.
13447,positive,negative,Only thing that would change these from &#34;amazing&#34; to &#34;legendary&#34; would be if they had a clip so you could clip them to your belt.

20972,positive,negative,"I love these! These are the ONLY earbuds I can wear that don't hurt my ears! I can wear these all day! I'm very excited!<br /><br />The only bad thing is that the ear-piece--that blue piece there?--keeps falling off and one time, I lost it. Sad day! So, I do recommend getting another set of just the tips because they do come off easily with time. And get a case to store them in."

SD cards are obsolete these days and hard to find, so buy one or more at the same time you buy your player.  SD cards go up to 2GB; any card 4GB or larger is an SDHC card.<br />&#62;  If you use the player for audiobooks, and want to load several audiobooks, say for a vacations, the most convenient thing to do would be to have several 512MB SD cards, one for each audiobook.  Few audiobooks are larger than 512MB.  Several audiobooks would fit on a larger card but navigation would become difficult, since the Lyra does not display folder names.<br />&#62; In addition older MP3 players (probably including the Lyra) can only handle a maximum of 500 tracks, but some audiobooks have more tracks.  In that case, load half a book at a time.  That also limits the utility of large SD cards.  But you could load the second half on a 512gb (or larger) SD card, and just insert the card when you get to the midpoint.<br />&#62; Without an SD card, only 512mb of memory is available, small these days when many MP3 players are 16GB or larger.

121,negative,positive,"I swim everyday. These headphones are not designed for high performance. In the first place, sound is great but gets reduced in an 80% when they touch the water, what makes me think they are not really waterproof and will be damaged if too long or many times in contact with water. In the second place the &#34;ergonomic&#34; shape hurts a lot in the ear, and when I mean &#34;a lot&#34;, a mean that it becomes really painful with the simple pressure of the swim cap; unbearable.

28840,positive,negative,Came on time😊😊😊😊😊
5026,positive,negative,Two speakers instead of one is superb! Each of them have a crystal clear sound and together they sound even better. All I can do is relax any time of the day and listen to anything I want depending on my mood. This was a sample which really proves itself worthy
21430,positive,negative,worked as I had hoped.
20892,negative,positive,Ordered July 19th. They have already broke. Charged all night and won't turn on. Great product. Beats better replace free of charge
7306,positive,negative,good quality got two for the price of one had to modify it a little to get it to work with asus t100 at the same time as charging but that was my bad as the t100s charging port and hdmi ar together
29729,positive,negative,"Works, is a ARC supported cable"
3386,negative,positive,"This was ok, much smaller than expected"
4115,negative,positive,"I love, love, love these headphones. They have the BEST sound. Better than headphones 5-6 times more expense. And they're SO SMALL.  But the problem I have with them is that their construction is.... not the best. The connections inside the headphone are super delicate and enough regular use will INEVITABLY make one headphone go dead. This seems to have gotten worse lately. I've returned 2-3 pairs to Amazon because that INEVITABLE problem has gotten faster, resulting in more dead headphones. Having only one headphone work is absolutely infuriating.  Edit: I bought a new pair about 40 days ago and one of the earphones is already dead. I love the audio from these headphones, but they're not reliable enough to recommend.   Koss made a great product, but it needs to be improved."
29210,negative,positive,Both speakers start vibrating when I play bass at medium level. I have found no remedy for this.
19762,positive,negative,"I got this to use with a music dock I have for my phone. With my phone in a case, I does not fit on the actual dock. This cable works perfectly.

Works perfectly and completely compatible with my iPhone 6 plus. *I received this item in exchange for my honest review"
21167,negative,positive,"We absolutely LOVED the Sweetpea3 v1.0. Yes there were tons of things you could've improved on the Sweetpea3 v1, but in general it was a wonderful toy that took a lot of abuse. The Sweetpea3 2.0 has way too many features that it doesn't need. It's basically a full Android device with a really bad touch screen. Our Sweetpea3 v1.0 lasted several years. This one was broken within DAYS. Don't bother. There's a good reason the original Sweetpea devices are currently going for $175+ on Amazon right now."

19954,negative,positive,"I NEVER write reviews.  But I felt I had to leave one. I purchased the Bose soundlink color, the Sony soundlink mini and the G-boom. I needed clear , loud sound. This was not that loud and VERY muffled. The mini blew this one out of the water as far as sound quality and volume. I ended up w the G-boom. It was way louder than both and great sound quality. However if you are looking for a small speaker the mini is the way to go!"

19243,negative,positive,"Fit fine for my application. Plugged in nicely with a positive detente. Wiring and output is a perfect match for the original. However, it wouldn't power the device.

26503,negative,positive,"It takes in all you phone alerts, text, email notifications during your music. Not for an office enviorment for me.

18469,negative,positive,Did not work well for the office to use in a mouse.
3662,positive,negative,"Look folks, it's a quality antenna at an affordable price. Took longer to open the box than it did to plug in. Got 22 channels within seconds. I'm sure there are Youtube videos or what ever. If you're looking for a budget antenna to cut the cord, this one works. I would buy it again for sure. Just don't feel like going through the whole technical analysis thing on a cheap antenna."
10501,positive,negative,"I use these when running/jogging, weight training, and leisure listening. They have performed well for me and have been a great buy. I’m second pair for my wife this week!!!!  • Battery Life – Gr8…I had them going three weeks after the initial charge and I work out at a minimum of 3 days a week. • Comfort – They don’t leave my ears numb and the design keeps the ear buds in place. I sweat heavily and these babies don’t budge. • Sound – Gr8 again. I’m no audiophile but the sound is decent and they produce enough bass for me. • Call Quality - Gr8 again.   My callers hear me crystal clear and report sounds coming from distances you would not think the  microphone would pick up. • Bluetooth Pairing – Pairing was painless. I have these paired to my laptop and Note 4. Update: 03.16.16 They died on me this weekend. They did NOT even last a year. DO NOT BUY"

5214,positive,negative,they work and hold charge very good
27247,negative,positive,Ordinary at best.  They don't hold a charge as they claim.  So long as you charge them within a couple of days of your planned use they are fine.  After that the charge drops far faster than the advertising suggests.<br /><br />You get what you pay for.

It worked for about 5 minutes, before the color went out and lines appeared across the screen.  This bulb makes the picture look like it did, when the tv was new."
21476,negative,positive,This Product does not work for my diehard 1150 power station/jump pack as  advertised  this is a not a replacement for the original as it does not plug in.
30552,positive,negative,"The 1st pair of these BOSE 20QCi was defective so I had to return them. The replacement's sound quality was also bad especially in left ear again. It could have been good but the sound kept cutting in and out sounding muffled then loud then just okay. It was best with noise canceling on but it did not compare to these B & W's.  I LOVE them and kept them. All I really care about is sound quality and they must stay in and be comfy. These are VERY comfy to my ears. All they do is insert inside your ear, that loop never touches you so I don't understand how they can't be comfortable to some. Maybe they have the wrong size rubber attachment?<br />The sound was better than the Bose by far and these were less $. I even read this statement in many reviews online. It is true! They don't have noise canceling but from my comparison, it didn't matter at all because it made NO difference in the quality. The only time NC is good is if you are traveling and want to quiet your ears without any music on. It has nothing to do with sound of music.<br />Plus the Bose noise cancel had that big cumbersome battery pack that would die often , so who wants one more thing to have to do and haul around. I just want to plug them in and listen.  Also, if the battery ran out & you had to listen with out NC on, it sounded terrible. You could listen just fine but the quality is crap without that battery on!!!<br />These B&W's are super light weight too so they don't pull out of your head or need a clip to clamp onto your shirt to protect from pulling out.<br /><br />I researched earbuds to death before I ordered anything and was willing to pay up to $300 for amazing sound quality. These were the only ones that I was happy with. I had Shure before these but don't waste your time with that brand. They died after 11 months and the quality was not great. I paid $250 for those. I wasn't going to waste time on Shure again."

26332,negative,positive,I needed to split a run of led lights to wrap around a room and this wasn't the item for the job because the led lights I'm using have male ends and this thing has male ends where I needed female. It would cost me more to send it back so I tossed it
17489,positive,negative,"Nice speaker, took a while to pair up with my Samsung galaxy tab 4 10.1 but when connected good sound, only miss was when turned on the tones where loud and notification Bluetooth on, loud even with volume down all the way, just like the one reviewer with the video stated but, it does let you know it's on, still gets a 5 rating."

26406,negative,positive,"Do they look pretty?  Yes.  Do I think they are worth the money?  Hell no.  They are bound cardboard, and will definitely not wear well if used for primary storage (what we were planning on using them for).  These will end up being replaced in a few years.  Should have stuck with the fugly binders that can store three or four times as much for the same price."
2949,positive,negative,"I got to admit I was skeptical about this product until I plugged it up to the TV. I am able to pick up all the channels in my viewing area, and the picture was cable tv quality. I wish there had of been 6 stars to give my review of this product. After hooking this antenna to my tv I am no longer spending wads of cash on cable tv, and I get all the local programming for free."

19273,negative,positive,Did not work well. Not noise reducing. Did not fit right
14227,negative,positive,Very old & cheaply made. For the price I can't complain to much but the buttons on my mp3 are cheap/stiff & backwards from what the manual &#34;key&#34;. The manual clearly tells & shows pictures for what buttons do what but mine was completely off. This would be great for kids so long as the learn the buttons. The SD card was a plus though. And the picture on mine isn't the one shown here. Maybe I got a very old version. Reminds me of the &#34;Microsoft word&#34;days.
21589,negative,positive,Does not fit into all ports like original cable
640,negative,positive,Looked like the ideal soution-and it helped clear up the wirring mess- but after two months all 4 connected cameras failed at the same time.  The root cause was that 2 out of the 4 connectors had failed somehow- affecting the other two cameras as well.  This is one of those cases where de-centralization (multiple power sources) is better layout that this.  Just figure- someone could tamper with 1 camera- short it out- and all 4 cameras will be disabled.  Not a good strategy.  Going back to original layout.

23449,negative,positive,"I bought these based on a rave review on wired.com, hearing that they were great value and well made, etc.<br /><br />After using them for about one month during my morning walk (i.e. light, normal use) I lost the sound in one side.<br /><br />They didn't cost me much, and the sound and fit were fine, but (in spite of the wired.com review), these end up being another cheaply made, disposable set of earbuds."
20413,positive,negative,"Works like its suppose too, would buy another one. The cord is made for a 1080p TV, but it is compatible with a 4K TV. So that's one I bought one. It works great and I would tell everyone to get one."
2221,positive,negative,"love it<br />i tried it out first at work n the sound was not good and was not very loud (max volume) at the beginning for some reason, but when i got home n tried it with the same fone n ipad i used at work n it was a lot louder n better, the bass obviously cannot be compared to a full-size speaker but still very good, considering the small size<br />music was nice n crisp, not muffle or static noises at all<br />connection was fast<br />it still plays music even when i plugged in the charger (not sure if it was charging though lol)<br />bottom has very good grip, wont move anywhere (even at max volume n crazy bass)<br />battery lasted for a very long time<br />so to sum it up, its worth buying people"
19441,negative,positive,"I purchased a 3-pack of the universal plug adapter (Type L) for our trip to Italy.  Two of the three adapters resulted in us blowing a fuse in two different hotels that we stayed in.  We only used them to charge our cell phones, well within the intended use.  After the second blown fuse, we decided to throw the two defective adapters away."
21984,negative,positive,"My husband loves them.. He sets it on the charger everytime he takes them off, however, after using for about two hours or so, the battery goes dead and he has to put them on  the charger again. Shouldn't the charge last a lot longer? I would like an answer please!"

24368,negative,positive,"Its a great speaker.  It sounds fantastic and connects easily but...<br /><br />After about 13 months, every few minutes it randomly shuts off.  All three lights flash and then it turns off.  It makes a nice yet extremely expensive paper weight."

19009,negative,positive,"Pros: No wires. Easy to hide under a beanie.<br /><br />Cons: the product is much too small for me as it starts hurting my ears after 10 minutes of use.

19003,negative,positive,"Update: December 2015. Despite my qualms regarding sound quality, I continued to use these headphones daily at work. They're gone for podcast audio. Every morning, I took them out of their bags, used them, then in the evening, carefully folded them up and placed the bag in my backpack, secured in a pocket. Hardly a tough travel regime. Over six months, the ear pad covers have come away, and I can't find s way to hook them back in place. See the attached photos for evidence of how these 'travel' headphones stand up to light travel. NOT recommended.  The key features of these headphones are in the name: premium, lightweight and travel, headphones, mic.  Premium: To some extent, yes. They are priced, at the time of writing, at $200. They have leather (or fake leather, I'm not sure) wrapped around the headband, they feel pretty solid, and the finish on the outside of each ear is obviously aiming for the Beats designer market. The cord is removable and therefore replaceable, which is a good feature to have. But the pads that make contact with the ears don't feel premium, cause sweating after a while, and have holes cut in them that look like they'll tear after a while. Philips were cheap though: the cord only has a mic and button, no volume controls. It must be too costly to get that iPhone/iPad certification. What's the point of being able to play/pause from the headphones, but not adjust volume without taking your phone out of your pocket?  Lightweight: Absolutely. They are light, they don't exert pressure on the ears during use, and they are barely noticeable in a bag. This does, however, make me wonder how 'premium' the electronics are when the set is this light.  Travel: They come with a bag and they fold up flat. When flat they are less than 2&#34; deep and 2/3rds the size of a Moleskine notebook. the cord unplugs so you can wrap it up small. Very very good for travel.  Mic: Yes, I skipped 'headphones'. That comes next. As already stated, they have a Mic on the cord, with a button for play/pause. But without volume control, what's the point? If I'm moving from listening to music to taking a call, I need to increase the volume of the headset to take the call. On a phone, that means taking the phone out of my pocket. On a Mac, that means using the controls on the keyboard. In Windows, if there are no media keys, that means using the mouse to adjust the volume in the system tray. Due to this inconvenience, I didn't use the Mic when making calls, and can't report on it.  Now, onto the most important part: Headphones. If they sound good enough, all the other issues can be ignored. If they're average, the other factors could make/break the deal. If they're poor, nothing will make these cans worth the hefty $200 asking price.  Frankly, the sound is poor. Take a standard pair of $30 Apple earbuds that come free with an iPhone, and add more bass. That's pretty much it. If you are not offended by the earbud sound, this is an improvement, and you may like these. But it's not $200 worth of sound here.  I either own or have reviewed the following headphones: http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR7506-Professional-Diaphragm-Headphone/dp/B000AJIF4E/ http://www.amazon.com/Bose-TriPort-Headphones-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B00009MK3T/ http://www.amazon.com/Bose-TriPort-Headphones-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B00009MK3T/ http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IUICOR6 http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MD827LL-A-EarPods-Remote/dp/B0097BEG1C/ and they make up my frame of reference. The cheapest are $30 and the most expensive list for $180. They are all fair competitors for the Philips under review.  These are ON-EAR headphones. Earphones/buds sit inside the ear canal. Around-ear phones have padding that wraps around the ear, blocking out external noise. These sit on the ear, without surrounding it. In ear phones can be uncomfortable, around ears may not fit well and cause the ears to sweat after a while. These should avoid both those pitfalls, but as I alreadystated, the pad materials made my ears sweat after a couple of hours' use. These also leak sound at low volume, unlike the around ears and in-ear models. Inconvenient in a quiet office.  But for me, the big issue is the sound. They are not much of a leap from the Apple earbuds (just better bass), are nowhere near as good as the $20 cheaper Bose (although that depends how much you like the 'Bose sound') and pale in comparison with the Sonys, which usually sell for around $80. If I just wanted to block out noise and have an ignorable soundtrack, I'd use the earbuds. If I want a light travel pair, the Bose fold down and have a removable cord, Mic and volume controls. IF I want decent listening quality, I'd take the Sony set. These don;t come close.  Others have said these sound great. I beg to differ. The recording engineer review was the most interesting, because the first thing I noticed with the cans was the lack of a coherent soundstage. 'What's a soundstage'? It's the illusion of a 3D layout of sound created by stereo speakers. IT makes you think the drummer and vocalist are in front of you, which the bass player's 2/3rds to the left of the stage and the guitarinst is 2/3rds to the right. It should be subtle enough to not be obvious, like the fake stereo of some 60's recordings (Like the Beatles stuff where the vocals come from the right and the drums from the left), but still, if you want, you should be able to work out where in the soundstage an instrument is.  The soundstage here is terrible. It's like turning two speakers to face each other, then standing between them. There's a very obvious gap in front of you, where no sounds come from. It's really weird, and the better the recording, the more obvious it is. Even mono recordings, which have no soundstage as such, have the same effect. However, it does depend on the type of music being played. Maybe that's why the sound engineer didn't have this issue. Listening to jazz was unbearable. Mono, which on headphones usually feels like it's just in the middle of your head, felt like the same music coming from two different rooms. Rock was pretty miserable - everybody was either far left or far right, or in the case of vocalists, both.  Where I had less issues was with hip hop and electronic music. Tech Nine's last album sounded great, but as with a lot of hip hop, there's no real stereo going on. Some of the simpler, pounding EDM sounded good too. But electronic music with intricate an soundstage was as poor as the other genres.  Maybe you think this isn;t a problem. It's sounds like I'm making a mountain out of a molehill. But I want my headphones to involve me in the music, certainly for $200. And this broken soundstage effect is so disconcerting, it's the aural equivalent of wearing an eyepatch: you'll get by, but things will never be 'right'. And for this price, there's no way the other useful features of these phones can make up for it."

Better choices are Harman Kardon CL, Sennheiser HD 280 Pro, AKG K550.<br /><br />I own Bowers & Wilkins P7 and P5. I also own Harman Kardon CL and the Harmans are vastly better in sound performance.

8101,positive,negative,I guess their working....????
9796,negative,positive,"The sound quality is fantastic! It's really loud and crisp. BUT!!!!!! The cord to make it work (mini-USB to plug into device and AUX3.5 to plug into where the sound is coming from, and a USB to connect to charge it) is crapola. It has to be in the perfect position to work (you know when you twist them and they go all crackly until it's perfect), and when I had the USB plugged into my computer and playing sound, when the sound stopped there was this very loud noise coming from it. I took it back to where I bought it and tested the new one in the store before buying and exact same problem. Damn!"
12113,negative,positive,"Update:  I have to recommend that you don't buy this product. After a dozen or so trips out on the lake with us, the sound quality has gone downhill considerably, and the connection drops frequently. I am using it in a kayak - it may get splashed with water but it's never been submerged so I don't think that is the issue, unfortunately it appears to be the build quality.  This is a nice little speaker for the price. I got it to take kayaking with me and it worked out great.  Pros:  *Super easy to connect from your device. *Decent sound and volume for such a small speaker. *The suction cup holds like crazy. *The water-resistance is a nice feature. *Charges fairly speedily and lasted most of a day when kayaking.  Cons:  *The instructions are truly terrible. They really needed a good English proof reader, and the instructions are in English but it's nearly indecipherable. *The controls feel like they are backwards. The control with arrow that faces left turns up the volume when it feels like it should turn it down. It's minor but I keep hitting the wrong buttons.  All in all it's a decent little speaker for the price. I received a (small) discount on this product in exchange for my honest review."

20565,positive,negative,Nice combo item for an emergency &quot;bug out&quot; bag.  Crank is easy.  I am just figuring it out but I have to press the power button three times to turn off because it turns on all three lights with the power button then when I push the power button a second time the pulsates instead of turning off thn when I push the power button again the light remains on with another light variation so at the third attempt to turn off it finally turns off.  Bad design but maybe there is a button I  need to find.  Good enough for my purposes.

Then 'well I have never heard of this problem before' and lots of 'this is very unusual' comments, then 'we'll see if we can work around it' and the like. It became more and more clear he's not going to help and repeats the issue is with my router as 'this issue is never intermittent'. Iknow it is not my router, I have tried it elese-where, same problem. No repair, just wasting time at this point. Straight up confirmed if he wasn't going to help me, and he said to go to an Apple store? How about no?

I use the SHARKK Boombox primarily in a metal building connected via Bluetooth to my LG G3 located outside the building because of the building's metal walls interfering with the WiFi signal from my residence.  At a distance of approximately 20 ft. the Bluetooth signal connects flawlessly through the metal wall.<br /><br />Also, the wall charger included with my Boombox quit charging and the good folks at SHARKK promptly (under warranty) mailed a replacement.<br /><br />We could not be more pleased with this product."

2375,positive,negative,Don't ask me why I bought a cheap thin sub cable from best buy. I returned two subs because I was getting a humm in the middle of the night. Not knowing it was the low quality of the cable. Switched over to these thicker cables and made a world of difference. I got two subs and tested both brands of cables and the difference could be noticed in you face. I quickly ordered the second mediabridge cable and enjoyed hard hitting bass!!

27484,negative,positive,i mistakenly ordered these for flashlight application.  should have been more careful.  they are fine for building battery packs with spot welded connectors but WILL NOT WORK for stand-alone applications like flashlights.  panasonic makes the best lithium batteries on the market - much better than chinese batteries which sometimes have only half the available energy of a panasonic.  just be sure to order the battery to suit the application.  of course Amazon quickly refunded my money and i was able to purchase the correct batteries (Orbtronic).  i often see people bitching about Amazon service but i've been doing business with them for years and have always been dazzled by their service.  including returns which they make as easy as humanly possible.

28584,negative,positive,My adapter is already not working. I have a short in the wire and I don't use it that much. I'm only in my car to travel maybe 20 minutes a day. I treat my stuff very nice as well. I don't have kids or animals moving it or have it sitting in the sun.
22384,positive,negative,Great looking screen.  Some reviews say that assembly was difficult.  If you know how an allen wrench works (one is provided) it's really not difficult at all.  Takes about a half an hour to assemble.  I stretched the screen and let it set a few hours before placing the center bar in.  The center bar seemed to provided negative feedback reviews but I slightly tapped it (tap not bang) into place with a rubber mallet.  After that was in place I let it set again for a few hours to finish stretching.  Absolutely no wrinkles or creases.  The screen is rolled so there shouldn't be any wrinkles if it was packaged correctly.  Just unroll and stretch.  Looks great on the wall.  Would recommend to other buyers in the market and you can't go wrong with the price.
22480,negative,positive,"I got tired of my old 12' long cables dragging on the floor connecting my TiVo to my Slingbox.  I replaced it with one if these and the video quality was awful! (and, yes, I connected them properly)  The picture was dark and hard to see.  I put my long old cables back and the video was great again.  Bottom line: These cables s*ck."
1114,positive,negative,This antenna was so easy to use. I just stuck the thin plate on my window. I needed  to stick more double sided tape to the sides and bottom of the plate. I stuck the the other end into an adapter and connected it into my DVB 2 TV (I am in Singapore). Scanning the channels was a breeze.Pictures are rock steady.

27477,negative,positive,"I thought this would be a bluetooth remote, like my smartphone. That doesn't seem to be the case, however. It appears to be an IR remote, and like many IR devices, outdoors in full sunlight, it suffers from interference from the sun. ( Source: I used to play laser tag outside a lot when I was a kid. )<br /><br />If you wait until the sun goes down, it works fine. If you try to use it during full sunlight, good luck. You'll be holding it 2 inches from the back plate of the mower and still get intermittent failures.<br /><br />I don't have any trouble with the buttons. A review or two stated they're fatiguing. Yeah, maybe. I just use it to &#34;Drive&#34; my RS612 from the back 40 to the front yard and into the two isolated zones there for periodic mowing. I don't mow with it manually. I drive it inside the perimeter wire and tell the mower to mow the zone. It works great for this, particularly as I don't have to unlock and hand off my cell phone to my 13 year old son (I mean, who knows what's on that cell phone that he doesn't need to see, right?) in order to get him to mow the lawn. I just tell him to wait until the sun goes down, then toss him this remote. He hates mowing the lawn with gas mowers, but he's always willing to mow it with the robot.<br /><br />Would gladly upgrade from one star to five stars if they fix the IR interference issue."

At some point, I will have to replace it.  Other than that, it is lightweight and very portable if you like to listen to cd's when you walk."
12035,negative,positive,"Universal is completely inaccurate for this product.  I needed an adapter for New Zealand plugs- this adapter does not work for those...apparently New Zealand is not in their universe.  Also, it is too large and bulky for traveling."
15031,negative,positive,Lost all my audio quality with this extension cable
25655,positive,negative,I used to steer clear from noise-isolating/noise-cancelling earphones because their ear tips tend to be too large and stiff that they`d hurt my ears really fast. Then I got these not knowing that they`re also noise isolating. I was going to return them but thankfully one of the many pairs of ear tips the manufacturer provided in the package fit me perfectly and I ended up loving them!
29272,positive,negative,I was impressed with crispness of the quietest of sounds and the lack of distortion from the loudest. I've been using them with my Samsung Galaxy Tab S for about a week now and wish that I could have bought these sooner.<br /><br />These are definitely on my gift list this year.
6049,positive,negative,"This review isn't so much on the product, as I agree with the reviews:<br /><br />- Speaker is compact and portable.<br />- Runs a long time on a charge (5 hours so far, and still going strong).<br />- The &#34;pop-out&#34; mechanism actually works to give sound a bit more &#34;body.&#34;<br />- The audio cable is longer than the previous model<br />- Added additional audio cable through the USB charging cable is welcome feature.<br /><br />This review is on Kinivo technical support. My initial ZX120 refused to turn on without the USB charging cable, even though the light was blue when connected, indicating a full charge. After playing around with the speaker to make sure it wasn't user error, I contacted Kinivo support. I was at least expecting the dreaded &#34;scripted response,&#34; where they would ask me if I had plugged in the device, even though I clearly stated as such within my original e-mail.<br /><br />To my surprise I received a response from an actual person on the next business day, evaluating that the product was possibly defective. They asked for my order # and physical address, and within 48 hours a new unit was being shipped to me. AMAZING customer service! Quick, to the point, and helpful. The product aside, I will not hesitate to recommend Kinivo to anyone based on this customer service experience.<br /><br />Thank you."

380,positive,negative,A top quality sub woofer. I use this in a band. The drawback is that it does not have handles. It is made to stay in one place and I knew that.

7406,negative,positive,"Moved back down to one star. Used them around 10 times and the battery no longer holds a charge and they no longer connect. Below is the old review.  Well worth the increased cost from a pair of $25ish Blimark earbuds I bought prior to these (returned them immediately). Easy to use instructions, and you get a nice little English woman whispering in your ear on startup, connection, and shutdown. Paired easily with my MPOW Streambot transmitter/receiver. I use these to run on the treadmill, and the Streambot hooks right up to the 3.5mm headphone jack so I can watch TV when I'm not gasping for breath and checking for signs of a heart-attack. This setup also allows me to frantically wave my arms around in front of me like an idiot without fear of ripping a wired earbud out.  I keep them charged so I cannot speak as to the battery live, but I have had no issues with a little over an hour of use. The range is good, I have clear sound even about 20ft if I break for a drink. Sound quality is good if you wear them properly. They can loosen in your ear a bit after some jolting, but they have never fallen out.  They are lightweight and very comfortable, I sometimes forget I have them on. They definitely live up to the sweat resistant description. I let my wife use them for a short run, so they were practically submerged in water by the time she was finished. After sanitizing with bleach and a high intensity UV light, they still work perfectly."
14091,negative,positive,"Outlook is great, but the alarm does not work well, some day it does."
8274,positive,negative,Plugs work in Australia.
17026,negative,positive,"I completely regret buying this system. The sound is clean, but far from impressive. The setup process isn't too challenging, but when your system goes down, you get to spend the better part of an hour walking through self-service diagnostics that take you in a complete circle, or you can spend days emailing their help desk, or you can call them during their limited business hours and wait on hold for 20 minutes.  A hassle for something that is supposed to be simple, and a very expensive hassle at that."
14768,positive,negative,"This product was fine ; however, the one of the speakers was cracked but I kept it. I would like to comment on the Lamy pen that was scheduled to be here today and has been delayed . I am very disappointed because it was must that t have it today."
25791,positive,negative,This is my old reliable antenna; I've purchased two others in the past. It says a lot about a product when the design remains unchanged over the years. Mine is hooked up to a converter box with a twelve year old Panasonic tv and the hi-def broadcasts look great. I get all of my local over-the-air channels plus PBS.    To get the best results place it near a window and point it in the direction of your local broadcast tower. Also find a spot where it won't get knocked over because the rabbit ears are delicate and break easily. I occasionally have to reposition it if extremely windy weather interferes with the signal. I live near police and fire stations and their communications will sometimes briefly scatter the signal when their vehicles drive by.   Update: I replaced my RCA antenna with the Mohu Leaf 50 which fixes the RF interference and windy weather problems. I'm using the RCA unit as an FM antenna for a stereo receiver that requires one to receive radio stations.
22802,positive,negative,goody goody :-)
476,positive,negative,"I like bass. These headphones provide plenty of it. I actually had to turn the bass in my settings down some because it came through so strong. I'll take that all day, every day. If you don't have good bass coming through, check the source. Because these things deliver. Now if I could just find the size of insert to use..."
259,negative,positive,One speaker had too much water and the the other speaker didn't have any water.👿👿👿👿
28516,positive,negative,"This adapter is made for the Sony SRS-X5 Bluetooth speaker, It is actually a normal 12v 3amp charger shown in the picture with a detachable adapter plug that fits the Sony.  It works as desired and the price is good.  If you already have a charger for something else you really only need the adapter for the Sony but at this price it is probably a wash."
14844,negative,positive,Not very good.  Thy run out of energy too quickly and do not hold charges for long periods of time.
21178,negative,positive,did not work for me. had to purchase an expensive converter. cable sits in a drawer currently.

20520,positive,negative,"My friends who bought beats are jealous. lol<br /><br />Ok, its 2 years later and they still hold a charge that lasts all week for me something like 60hrs of music time. The foam parts are starting to show wear, but I have really gotten my money out of this one!"
28274,positive,negative,Cords stay tidy and this piece does not move!
24827,negative,positive,"I bought this mount for my dorm room TV. The box says up to 90 degrees of motion for televisions 13&#34;-39&#34;, but it was too small to allow my 32&#34; TV to rotate perpendicular to the wall. If you require a mount that allows the full 90 degrees, know that this one only allows for that range of motion when the TV is under 31&#34;."
7071,positive,negative,"Much more durable than the stock options. They are very comfortable, even when I wear them for 8 hours a day (at work). My ears don't even get sweaty."
188,positive,negative,It rocks! . Holds a long charge.
27938,positive,negative,"I purchased this Audio Splitter to interface my Rosetta Stone headset with my Toshiba laptop.  The laptop had the typical two 3.5mm jacks for Headset and mic, while the RS headset had a single 3.5 mm plug with four rings.  One common, Lt and Rt headset audio, and one for the mic.  This splitter worked perfectly.  I would recommend this for anyone with a similar need.  You may have to go into the Windows control panel and make sure you Windows computer has detected  the mic and headset properly.  Also set the mic levels."
28368,negative,positive,"Both ends are male, should be male x female. Now you need another length of coax to splice it in with."
12709,negative,positive,Headphones arrived after long shipping timw with faulty wire. Sounds like music is underwater unless holding cord just so. When holding cord in place sound quality is mediocre. Headphones relatively comfortable.
6725,negative,positive,"The design fits perfectly in the garden, the sound is just enough but I prefer bluetooth. Its more<br />Of a personal preference thats why i had to return it."
19125,negative,positive,Easy to cut off so worry to use it.
20888,negative,positive,The Noise cancelling was good but the sound quality is far away from its price point. To me at the end of the day sound quality is all that matters when you buy a headphone/earphone. Everything else becomes secondary.
8557,negative,positive,Not good at alllllll
16273,positive,negative,"This is hands down the best remote that Logitech has ever made.  If they would simply revive the ergonomics of this model, and combine it with the features and hub in the current revision, I'd buy it at any (nearly) any price.  I must assume that they fired whatever ergonomics experts they employed after they broke the mold for this one.  The current models place the useful buttons at the top edge, you know.. where you can't reach them."
22428,positive,negative,"I am pleased with the sound quality coming from this Mp3 player. It took a minute or two to figure out how to adjust the volume and it can get quite loud. This unit is rigid enough to stay planted in my ears, which is what I wanted to go to the gym, but there are only one set of rubber ear pieces included with the unit. There is no button for shuffle that I am aware of and if there is I am sure the Apollo group will correct me as I have misplaced the instructions at this point.  I will be updating my experience with the player and I hope these hold up under sweating at the gym, but that's a later review update."
24675,positive,negative,So I bought a box of power bank and I didn't know I was getting it with no batteries (is what happens when you don't read product description) so as soon as I got it I bought these batteries and they came with a charger it was really lifesaver and they were less expensive than other ones out there. They came in time and well packaged.
2769,positive,negative,What a pro!
12257,positive,negative,I wonder why these are so hard to find
17031,negative,positive,"I received it in a couple of days which was fine, but in just 2 days the power cord did not work anymore. I really did not know what to do. My daughter did this for me, cause I am 90 years old and did not know what to do."
18672,negative,positive,Product is very large in size and using this 90 degree adapter to hide wire or save room is a definite NO!
20073,positive,negative,Very sturdy and well made.  Came with mounting screws.  I put two of these in my RV so I could switch the external input (coming from the outside into the RV) from cable TV to my satellite receiver depending on what I was going to use.  The 2nd one was used to select the input going to the TV (from inside the camper) to either cable/antenna or satellite.
11175,negative,positive,"They don't &#34;snap&#34; very well into the socket, even when completely unobstructed.  In the case of the headphones<br />I bought these for (see photo attached) the wide barrel of the cord does not allow me to insert it completely, since<br />the female is protected by a sleeve of plastic. Cheapo Monoprice cords, for instance, work fine here. These present cords do seem<br />to be tangle resistant and sturdy, as advertised, but if they don't snap well, no satisfaction is possible."
10392,positive,negative,"A little difficult to install, but its so worth it. We moved our room around after installing the tv on the tv mount. But since the tv can be moved and positioned however you want it, we didnt have to worry about having to go through the trouble of taking it back down as we would of had to with another mount."

13613,negative,positive,"Was way smaller than expected, this thing is literally pocket-size - pay attention to the specs, don't repeat my mistake and just assume. What's more important, the thing did not do its job as an iPhone extension well: the party on the other end of the line could hardly hear me. Switched to a regular pair of wired computer speakers and used an iPhone's mike: much much better."
10226,positive,negative,"Easy to install. I use the mic for both Skype and gaming VOIPs (vent,mumble) and it has great clarity. The cord was a bit of a pain and would constantly ding against the headphones when I moved but the accessory cable clips (separate order, same company) to secure it to the headphone cord fixed that issue.  UPDATE: Sticky bits stopped being sticky after about 8 months. It wasn't too much of an issue given that the magnetic portion keeps the mic in place on the metallic grating of the headphones (sennheiser 598s), but could see this becoming a hassle if my headphones had been plastic coated. I would know more about the longevity but the mic, through no fault of its own, is dead. These coating of the wires seems to be Catnip 2.0 and in my spraying the wire down with chili mixture to deter bitey animals, I seem to have missed a particularly tasty spot. :/"

25376,positive,negative,Goof
29758,negative,positive,Aviod at all costs as the spcs as advertised are a pipe dream at best. I always say buy cheap buy twice. End of story.
23458,negative,positive,I thought they were going to send me a new one but when it got here I found out that it had already been used and the sound was good but the only thing was that the cable that is atatched does not work as well .
2784,negative,positive,"Well, at first it was awesome but after one use. Is not longer holding charge and it sync whenever it feels like it. I can't write any more truthful review than this. Don't buy this product."
3581,negative,positive,"The buds are cheap and sound like trash. Plain and simple. People that are saying they sound &#34;great&#34; are obviously hearing impaired. If you're looking for good sound quality, look elsewhere and run away from these. Like as fast as you can. These are meant to sit on your desk or on a shelf and look cool."
12514,positive,negative,"You get what you pay for with these bulbs.  I bought a cheaper one in late 2014 and it was getting to the point where the screen glare was affecting the picture more and more.  Eventually, darker colors were so hard to see all together.<br /><br />After reading the reviews on this one, I bought it, installed it easily, and it works great.  I can see everything so clearly mid day when I would be having the most glare.  I even had to turn the brightness down.  Don't waste your money on the cheaper version, you will just end up buying this later on."
11756,negative,positive,"These wipes are terrible. They leave behind a bunch of lint, which is most unhelpful when you're trying to clean up your phone before applying a screen/back protector. I would only recommend using them if you have some real grime build up to remove from your computer/phone/tv screen, something that calls for a little dampness to get off. You'll definitely want to follow up with a microfiber cleaning cloth after using these, to remove all that darn lint the wipes left behind on your device. I think they do dry alright, didn't have much streaking left on the back of my Edge+ phone, but the lint is a real headache and deal killer for me. Also, the dispenser is poorly designed. It's way too big of an opening, and you have to manually tear off a wipe (then push the other dozen that came up with that wipe back down into the canister). I purchased my can of these at Meijer for $4.99, surprisingly a bit cheaper than the Amazon price. For 5 bucks, 70 wipes seems like a good deal, but these in the end, are not worth the purchase. I recommend using a high alcohol, such as 91%, rubbing alcohol with microfiber towels for cleaning electronic devices. Cheaper, cleaner, and far more effective than these wipes."

16553,positive,negative,"Just turned our 2 HDMI video game TV into a 5 HDMI one able to switch between XBox, Playstation and Wii."
3919,negative,positive,I have been using these headphones for 2 years now.  I bought these for $300 and they have the quality of $50 headphones.  They leak so bad it made me want to write this review.  Impossible to listen to music at any medium to high volume in the car without everyone else listening with you.  They feel like creaky plastic and the sound is absolutely not on par with the price.  Beats by Dre spends so much of their money on marketing that it is impossible for them to make quality headphones at a decent price. I would NOT recommend ANYONE buying these headphones.  There are headphones out there (Bose and Sound Logic come to mind) that have more bang for your buck.

12675,negative,positive,"I purchased the wireless power Beats 2 because the Beats marketing machine got to me and I had to try this phenomenal set of earbuds with the extraordinary base. I was so disappointed in the sound quality, comfort and cheap plastic looking and feeling construction.  I have used Bose earbuds for years and can confidently say that the sound quality, comfort and construction are superior to what Beats is offering. If you are like myself and currently use Bose earbuds, but are curious about this Beats phenomenon forget it and stick to what you know and that is Bose produces a quality produce that we all expect."

Since my previous posting the manufacturer contacted without prompting saying they read my review.  They substituted my purchase with an upgraded mount at no charge.  They followed up with several calls and emails to make sure that I received the replacement, it was installed and that I was completely happy.  Thus the 5 stars for customer service.  I believe the manufacturing issue is still present with with the APDAM3B and will reveal itself if your television is near the top end of the weight scale which mine was.

16432,negative,positive,Complete garbage!!! Stopped working after one day! Product converted sound perfectly the first time i used it<br />to connect my ps3 to some analogue monitors and when i was done i unplugged it as suggested by other reviews.<br />The next day i turned it on in and all i got was a slight hiss coming out of my speakers. I checked to make sure everything<br />was plugged in correctly which it was and made sure that the sound output on my ps3 was set to pcm as the instructions<br />specifically say to do in the box the unit came in. also i was using both high quality toslink and rca cables which worked perfectly<br />well when hooked up to other appliances so there's no problem there. i have read other reviews expressing similar problems with<br />other digital to analogue converters in this price range so i decided to spend an extra 20$ dollars on The SIIG Digital to analogue<br />converter and it has worked perfectly so far which is much better than this Orei garbage breaking after one day!!!!<br />sorry for run on sentences

You are tied to using the Sonos app with the Sonos speakers.  Supposedly I can spend another 350 or so to get ANOTHER piece of equipment from Sonos that will let me do this.  OR I can just buy the Korus speakers that will do what I need. without an extra peripheral.  Very disappointed.  The speakers do sound nice.  The lack of functionality for the price is just awful.

1034,positive,negative,"This is an excellent jack for the price. People buying these components should first understand how they work with their intended applications before purchasing.<br />This cable is verified working as I am using it on a $7000 Professional In-Car DVR Recording System. So it is not as cheap as most would say.<br />Unless using a break-out box or mixer of some sort, most audio devices today only except the most common plug from factor, which is called a TRRS connector. It has 2- 4 contacts on the barrel.<br />These are for stereo only and usually 3.5mm in size. The smaller type 2.5 is more rare and not commonly used. Some devices do not accept a TRS type connector, which is reserved for mono or microphone devices. They have 1-2 contacts on the barrel, and often confused with stereo.<br />If using this 3.5mm mono jack, a 3.5mm mono cable should also be used. Not a stereo cable. Usually PC's themselves can distinguish between stereo and mono, and are able to move the audio to the appropriate channel by itself.<br />So plugging a mono cable directly into a PC should alleviate allot of problems.<br />Non smart devices using only hardware and sensing would probably get confused and the result would be no audio.<br />So if using an RCA mono plug, use a mono cable to plug into the intended device. Strongly advised not to use RCA mono to stereo cable to device. There would probably be a mismatch somewhere in the chain, and the end result would be your disappointment.<br />Converting a monophonic sound that uses single channel of audio for sound output, to a stereophonic sound that uses two channels of audio for sound output, whether using software or hardware to create this effect, a person should know how these components work.<br />Trying to convert from mono to stereo and vice versa, one should first grasp how these modes differ from each other.<br />If using this type of hardware, it is also strongly advised to study the plugs form factor, and understand how to properly convert audio.<br />Also please understand, converting mono to stereo does not make it true stereo. Converting single channel to dual channel audio basically<br />creates a duplicate of the same channel for left and right listening. One could create 3, 4 or even 5 channels. But trying to extract separate<br />audio from a single channel will never really create true stereo, 5.1 or even 7.1.nvert audio.<br />Also please understand, converting mono to stereo does not make it true stereo.

I vaguely considered RMAing them, but it seems Panasonic's consumer-facing returns/repairs structure has changed and the warranty these came under is no longer honored. Or maybe it is and I just can't find it. I don't know or particularly care; I gave up and just bought a new pair off Amazon, and that's what I'll keep doing every time a pair breaks, until they discontinue them. The sound quality is good, they're at a great price point, and the light purple color they come in is cute. That's all I could possibly ask for, really."

9559,negative,positive,"My use for this cable was to just get video between my laptop and my 40&#34; TV. I use it for Telework (Telecommuting). I always use Blue Jeans Cable and had an 8 foot Series-FE HDMI cable from BJC that served this purpose exceptionally well. I don't do gaming and I have to have this working all the time, without fail.  This KabelDirekt 15 foot HDMI cable fell flat on it's face. I am no novice when it comes to computers. I thought with all those 5 stars, I'll spend $12 instead of $43.75 to get a new 15 foot HDMI cable. This KabelDirekt purchase was a complete waste.  It would not sync up to the television. I decided to reboot the laptop since this was the cable's first hookup (Note: I NEVER have to reboot my laptop when I use BJC HDMI Cable. If we didn't rearrange the room such that I now needed a 15ft cable, I would have never tried to buy a cable that was not from BJC. It just pained me that I obsoleted my 8 foot BJC Series-FE HDMI cable only because we rearranged the room I use it in).  I did everything I could to make the synchronization stable. EVERYTHING. If the computer slept, I lost synchronization. If the screen saver came on, I lost synchronization. I wasted time and money on this.  Just to double check I wasn't insane, I temporarily moved my laptop closer to the TV so that the BJC 8 foot Series-FE HDMI cable could reach the TV. The KabelDirekt 15 foot HDMI cable was currently plugged in with the TV not able to synchronize with the laptop. I swapped out the 15 foot KabelDirekt cable with the 8 FOOT BJC cable and within the blink of an eye, the laptop was synchronized with the TV. No reboots, no configuration changes. Merely a swap out of HDMI cables.  This KabelDirekt 15 foot cable is on its way to the electric recycling program. I have ordered my BJC 15 Foot Series FE HDMI cable which is now on Amazon and like all the other cables I order from BJC, I know I made the right decision.... I will NEVER stray from BJC again."

28680,positive,negative,"This is a cool little device. It took me a little effort to get it to function properly, however that was more of other people's misinformation. More on that later.<br /><br />This little headset takes your phone and basically holds it inside the case, and anything that can be displayed on your phone (doesn't matter if your phone is 3d or not.) and gives you a private little screening room.<br /><br />The instructions are a little hard to follow as many are, again in broken english however, it is a very simple concept to use. After reading this you'll be all set.<br /><br />All you need to do is google or torrent (legal or not depends on copyright blah blah blah check your local laws) anything even some you tube clips. What you need is 3d-sbs (stand for side by side) What side by side will look like is 2 of the same images on the screen at the same time. Not one image with red and blue lines like the old 3d books. not one blurry image. It NEEDS to have 2 of what appears to be the same image on the screen. Double vision.<br />The problem for me is that when i searched youtube for 3d sbs i got a lot of 3d video results that were labeled as sbs that were labeled incorrectly. I started to doubt my knowledge of 3d and thought perhaps the headset was just not working. the different 3d formats all have a name. And sbs or side by side should have what looks like the screen split and half with the same image on both sides.<br /><br />open it on your phone, turn your phone landscape ways put it in the box, close it. now with the unit strapped onto your head you may need to adjust the eye pieces using the 2 small sliders just on top of the box, I could see the center divider of the box and it hurt my eyes to look in until i found an actual correct sbs. then my eyes focused properly and it no longer hurt.<br /><br />This is a cool little gimmicky box. My boy who is nine really seemed to love it. While we never got big into 3d i can see it is still growing slowly and more content is becoming available.<br /><br />So i would have no problem recommending this product to someone who was into this kind of stuff.

I would love to have seen either a notch for headphone wire or perhaps an aux port to allow for some headphones, that could really create a little mini theater experience.<br /><br />This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

10843,positive,negative,"Leveling with a Vizio M70-C3 70&#34; 4K tv.  Everything went well, except for the leveling.  Here's my $1.00 fix.  It takes a leap of faith to let go of that tv after it is mounted, but the bracket does as advertised; except, hold this large size tv level.  No matter how tight I tightened the two screws on the back (Screw S) in the instructions, the tv would still lean to the right (front facing).  I eventually removed the bottom screw and took it to home depot because I was slowly stripping out the head.  I found that this is a metric M5 x 16mm Flat hd Phillips Zinc Plated machine screw with Home Depot part # 574 792. I picked up a pack of those, but also the M5-.8 x 16MM Pan Head Philips machine screw (2 pack) with Home Depot # 204 462 (http://www.homedepot.com/p/Crown-Bolt-M5-16-mm-Phillips-Pan-Head-Machine-Screws-2-Pack-36958/202836136). I ended up using the pan head on the bottom and that worked great, immediately solving the problem.<br /><br />For some reason, no matter how tight I tightened the screws that came with the device, it wouldn't hold. I would recommend actually placing a small level on the top of the tv as well while you're doing this.<br /><br />Here's what it looks like with the pan head machine screw on the bottom hole: http://i.imgur.com/HTQj8ho.jpg<br /><br />Here are the machine screws in their packaging from Home Depot: http://i.imgur.com/dVsFhuz.jpg?1<br /><br />M5 fit at Home Depot:  http://i.imgur.com/uCvvywj.jpg"

6753,negative,positive,Not waterproof.
11808,negative,positive,"Bought for 225e's. These things are huge and for me do NOT sound anything like as good as many reviews suggest they might. Primarily because they constantly keep slipping and needing frequently shifting back to restore the sweet spot sound. Nor does patiently adjusting the volume/EQ work for me. These G's are supremely light and very comfortable though. Happily I have average sized ears, not super sized Barak Hussein Obama thingys which doubtless lessens the G's utility. . The  serious sound degradation is more than sufficient to return them after a disappointing 30 minute test. No point in having high quality headphones if the superlative sound constantly dissipates.<br /><br />As for the Zonk L's. I got a &#34;free&#34; pair of these with the $20 Ear Zonk Grado headphone case I got for my brand new Grado 225e's. The case is decent quality for the money, given it's presumably not just a generic headphone case but manufactured for Grados,  so the &#34;free&#34; Zonk L's make the case  a bargain.<br /><br />They are NOT exactly the same as the Grado's which are twice the price. An immediate difference in the bevelling on the inner cone is glaringly apparent between the two products. Who knows if that is the direct cause of of the lesser quality sound, and/or a slightly cheaper foam? The Grado L's sound distinctly better than the Zonk L's. Not massively better,. but noticeably. .The Zonks are somewhat less of a typical steel wool feel than the Grados though. But I will gratefully use these freebies on my old Grado SR 60's, which greatly improves the sound over the old flat standard S cushions. Makes you wonder just how cheap these things are to manufacture if they can hand them out for free with the case. On the next hot and sunny day in Dixie I will try washing the Grado L's in some gentle washing up liquid to see if this facilitates a softening as other reviews suggest is attainable."

28358,negative,positive,"The wortst subwoofer I ever had. I asked questions on this page before purchasing this fridge.  Dissapointment is an understatement.. I previously owned BIC 12 with blown amp. Luckily for me, someone got me a Gemini 15&#34; on craigslist for $120..the sub performed very well till I got a new guy who occupied our basement.  His bass was filling my room and I started swatching for a sub. I realized he was using  10&#34; klipsch synergy subwoofer. After doing all my research and reading reviews, I decided to give this Cerwin Vega a try. I was the most dissapointed man on earth. So amwthing came up mg mind and I used the Cerwin Vega amp for the BIC 12. Amazingly, I was taken aback. The first time our landlord texted me to bring my music down. The  Bass was crazy!!! I mean crazy!!! Wow!!! I gambled and it worked. The system comprises of<br />1. SONY TA-E9009ES PREAMP<br />2.EMOTIVA UPA-500 POWERED AMP<br />3. MAC MINI with KODI software.

2351,negative,positive,"I feel bad rating this a one star because the features on paper are all there. I had high hopes on the comeback of RCA Company via Audiovox's 808 branding to appeal to the young generation.<br /><br />However it turns out that it's more of a gimmick.<br /><br />WHAT I DID NOT LIKE:<br /><br />- The rotating earcups do nothing really that a well built flexible headphone band can do. In fact it's more cumbersome to rotate than to simply remove from your ear and reposition just like you normally would. It ended up a bit annoying.<br /><br />- The ear cups provide mediocre fit to my average sized ears. It's too round and not big enough. Needs to be more oblong in shape for a better fit and sound isolation.<br /><br />- The silicone padding is unique which I welcome and say kudos on this innovative application but it's too thin that I can feel the metal headband pressing down. Needs to be thicker for more padding.<br /><br />- The sound is horrible. It just was muffled from the highs to the mids that the low end becomes prominent. It's like someone took an equalizer and dialled down the highs and dialled up the bass.<br /><br />- Flimsy cord with fat ends that wouldn't fit my iPhone with a case. I like that it uses generic connectors and has a non-tangling feature, but my more expensive headphones uses fatter cables but has a thinner end connector so it fits even with a case.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKED:<br /><br />- The floating speaker concept is an interesting application that I feel deserves better. It provides better isolation from the headband. Too bad the actual speaker doesn't deliver to back up the design.<br /><br />- The metal headband I really love. It's minimalistic and authoritative at the same time that the height adjustment clicks with finesse.<br /><br />- The silicone padding is a great first I've seen and is so easy to clean and replace. But it's too thin my head hurt from the headband pressure.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />For the listed price the fit and finish is actually very good. I wanted to love this headphone and use as an everyday gear but the moment I put it on my ear and started a familiar music that I listen through studio quality monitoring headphones as well as studio monitor speakers that are of different brands but sound very similar, this 808 just played a different tune altogether. It's so bad it stood out.<br /><br />And in the end no matter the material and build quality. You buy it for the sound quality and I sadly can't recommend it even at this price.nd finish is actually very good.

Ear covers are quite comfortable.  After a couple months of use the solid single plastic bar design cracked at the top. They have degraded ever since to the point where I had to throw them out. I guess it is my head size but these are definitely not designed to be durable. I think less of the quality of the materials now."

I was was very impressed as I was skeptical. The high def picture was better than cable. Hard to believe but true. I then tried an outdoor antenna that I bought on eBay. Same amount of channels for more money and I had to install it and run the cable from the roof. I am sure it won't make the first winter storm up here in Maine. The design was cheap and it was made of plastic. I just ordered another Winegard. You cant beat this product for the money.

I mounted a 60&#34; LG TV, 60&#34; TVs are not that lite. Therefore you really need to use the wall joist to secure the rail into. Having the wall joist exactly where you need them to be is a long shot. No bog deal if you can slide the TV down the rail to center it on the wall after mounting it. That is exactly what I tried to do with this mount but since I had to bolt the rail together which made for a steel seem in the middle there was no way to do this. So now my TV sits a little off of center. Not so much that I had to send the mount back but the design of this mount leaves a lot to be desired. I would not purchase this again. Also it does not tilt very well either. Feels like its going to rip itself out of the wall when trying to tilt it. One star is a gift when rating this mount."

I have been a technician for a long time so I investigated the Dummy Plug electronics and wiring.  I validated that the Dummy Plug was correct - 75 ohm resistors on each R G B lead to ground with no other pins connected.

25423,negative,positive,"I bought this cord for a great price, it came early in the mail. I have a brand new mophie case to use it with a it wouldn't work so I tried it with other things and it still didn't work."
12220,positive,negative,Totally recomended! I just dont like the color.
16917,negative,positive,"I have not been able to use it. I rquested for replacement, and I have not heard anything since purchase."
23566,negative,positive,Worked great but failed after a year.
29116,positive,negative,"Works, but no sound - had to get an optical Toslink to Analog Audio Converter to get sound."
26243,positive,negative,"I bought this IEM to replace my Klipsch X7i (in-line control failed after 7 months).<br />I only had this one for a week so I can't comment on build quality.<br />I did read all the reviews before I purchase this piece and I saw a lot people complaining about the loop fitting. Luckily I didn't have any trouble with the loop. In fact, the loop is a brilliant design actually fixes the ear piece in place even when I'm running around.<br />The sound quality is very impressive and the noise isolation is very good. I'm a bus/Bart rider and even when I turn the music volume to middle level I can hardly hear the people talking around me, nor the train or bus noise. So far this is the best noise isolated ear piece I've owned.<br />I also read some people (especially the hip-pop fans) not happy with the base level. I download Muze music player for iPhone, which comes with a 10 bands EQ, which lets you adjust the base level to your preference. It works pretty well."
14059,positive,negative,"They are CD sleeves, they are black, and they work just like they are supposed to. (Most envelopes do.) Unlike the last ones I ordered, they are white on the inside, but who cares?"
29499,negative,positive,"I had an older IR extender (different make) which worked GREAT. I then moved, it was packed up and busted so bought this one. It works but the receiver only has a 4 to 5 foot distance so that is NO GOOD.  :) Will have to look for another one"
15204,negative,positive,"These headphones have a very distracting feedback/buzzing sound that pulses in the background when it's playing music via Bluetooth connection. It goes away as soon as it's plugged in via headphone jack. I thought it might just be a defect with the first set I ordered, so I ordered a replacement, but they had the same exact problem. I'm a writer, so I like to listen to soft music while I work, but the feedback is just way too loud and irritating. Very audible over the music. Disappointing, because they're comfortable to wear, a good price, and have great sound when plugged into a headphone jack."
12556,negative,positive,"I had been using an old set of rabbit ears (do they still make those?).  Anyhow, I saw this at a good price and thought it was worth a try.  Turns out the old rabbit ears done just as well, if not better."
5653,positive,negative,Remote worked fantastic but then the radio started to act up due to capacitor plague. I ended up scrapping the radio. I'll keep the remote in case I run across another radio that works.
14656,positive,negative,Nice. Runs on most applications. Tried different software and applications thus resulted GOOD device connectivity.
1498,positive,negative,"Have used these before for a few years.  Great on DVD's.  Local hardware store stopped stocking this particular brand.  Massage the package before opening, keeps for a week in a ziplock bag unless doing multiple disks at one time."
11408,negative,positive,"Nice but grossly  over priced, otherwise I would give it 5 stars. Probably cost .50cents to manufacture"
14751,negative,positive,"I had such high hopes for these earphones, thinking I finally found ones that would stay on while I run. They were ok the first few times I used them--though it took a while to put them in and adjust them, which was quite annoying--and the sounds quality wasn't great. But they were ok. After a few more times of usage the wire got so bent out of shape and the buds kept falling out--no matter how tightly I adjusted the wire. I've only had them for a few weeks and I'm already looking for a new pair of good sports headphones."
3296,negative,positive,broke quite quickly not well made.
8344,negative,positive,"It has a nice sound but it always fell off my ears, too heavy to hold still."
21237,positive,negative,"Pleased with the quality of this cable. It is replacing a brand new one I had ordered that was cheaper and failed to function properly. This cable worked well as soon as I connected it. I should have gotten a 20' instead, the other was a 25'. I would definitely buy from this company again."
13086,negative,positive,"Display is too bright enough, not simple to use. Only good for playing MP3 by Bluetooth"
7202,negative,positive,Not a good buy not worth the money.  Shipment was excellent.
5290,positive,negative,It was just what I wanted.
16815,positive,negative,"My wife hates all my remotes.  I even have a universal remote in our living room, with macro programming that turns everything on at once, but that is too complicated (too many buttons).  I got this for our TV, Blu-ray, Apple TV setup in our exercise room  I had labeled the remotes as &#34;TV&#34;, &#34;Blu-ray&#34;, etc, and she still calls me to ask which remote to use, then gets frustrated when she has to switch to a different remote for the Apple TV, etc.  . Now, one remote does all that she needs.  I didn't even use the streaming button - After programming the TV button, which literally took a minute, I then added the remote to the Apple TV.  I used the &#34;Guide/Home&#34; button for the Apple TV menu button, set the arrows and OK buttons, plus the play, pause, and stop buttons. So the TV button controls both the TV and Apple TV, and the DVD button handles the Blu-ray.  Simple.  Now I just have to make sure she points it the right way (and I'm not kidding)."
789,negative,positive,Cool little stereo.  Really liked the look of it and it sounds great BUT........  Battery life is TERRIBLE.  Not worth it!
24267,positive,negative,I am changing my review because Amazon corrected a defective issue i had with the products. This thing is louder than you would expect. It has some weird features on certain settings where all the speakers don't work and it switches back and forth but works best in Aux mode . The wires are strictly for this device so you cannot upgrade the wire length which is unfortunate.
20898,positive,negative,"this looks like a quality product and it was for 1, but  _2__ were sent, cheap at half the price! I ordered the wrong product and it cost almost as much to send it back as it cost so I kept it."
15337,positive,negative,Thanks for saving my tv. All of my AV ports quit working and I only have one HDMI port on my old flat screen. I hooked this device to my HDMI port and now I have 4 HDMI ports and have by passed all of my AV ports that have quit working. GREAT product!! Thanks again!
23048,positive,negative,"Have lived with a massive throughput problem in our house for years. Cable company could not solve it, I could not solve it. Have tried a Radio Shack amp, and it was useless. Read the reviews, and after having no luck with checking the cable connections, bought this with trepidation. 100% of the channels are crisp and clear (we had close to 50 upper band channels that were not coming in at all, out of about 300 channels)... I cannot recommend this enough! Install took 5 minutes (replaced the first splitter in the house with this gem, and then plugged it into an outlet). Internet speed is up about 10%, phone is a bit clearer than it was before the install. Best money I have spent in a very long time!"
21844,positive,negative,5 stars says it all.
20629,positive,negative,A+A+A+A+
27108,positive,negative,I lost my first one so bought another. You cant beat the sound quality for the money.
17595,positive,negative,Brighter than the Epson glasses.
3336,negative,positive,"This cable is advertised as being capable of transmitting 18Gbps. I bought one thinking it would be able to drive a Samsung JU6700 4k monitor through a GTX 960. The TV would not work using 4k@60hz with chroma subsampling. I bought a different Mediabridge cable (Ultra series) which did work, which this leads me to believe that this cable is not capable of the advertised 18Gbps. Avoid this cable if you actually need a full bandwidth hdmi 2.0 cable"
11500,positive,negative,NOT BAD FOR THE MONEY.HAS A GOOD OUTER SHELL
8622,positive,negative,no problems worked with gtd audio wireless mice
25699,positive,negative,It did everything it said it would AND... dramatically improved the quality of the picture to the point were non videophiles mentioned how good the video looks. Color coding helps not to have to track the cable to the component. Seems to be made of quality material.
8596,negative,positive,"Well, they fit.  That's the best I can say.  No problem putting them on, but the foam is so thin you might as well not have anything."
30009,negative,positive,I wanted to try using this component cable for my xbox one but there was no display on my tv. Do not purchase this cable if you're looking for an hdmi to component cable for xbox one.
23293,positive,negative,"I like these iGotTech cable clips because they're colorful, flexible and they keep my cables in place. I will definitively recommend them to those who like to keep their desk organized while not having to continuously fix the tangled wires. Each of the clips has a sticker on the bottom of it and before you attach the clip you fix your cable first. That way you the cable will remain still once you stick the clip , you won't be able reuse it. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions."
27882,positive,negative,never new these existed but a must have for a dvd collector
22324,negative,positive,"Shipping was very fast, but the device did not work properly. Cablemasters sent a replacement very quickly and made sure I was happy. They are dedicated to making sure their customers are happy and therefore I highly recommend any products they sell."
4978,positive,negative,unreal.
30062,positive,negative,Battery was correct for my application.  Received it in only a few days after ordering.
27373,negative,positive,"As far as the sound is concerned they do a fine job.  My problem is that as headphones they do not stay in my ears.  I've tried several tips and no luck, not sure if it's my ears or the way the ear buds are shaped/weighted but they always fall out of my ear within 10 seconds of putting them in.  Also I am very nervous about the durability of the cord, it just feels real thin and weak.  All of that in mind I cannot recommend them to anyone."
28882,positive,negative,"I bought this on the recommendation of my daughter. It has replaced our coffee table mess of six different remotes with only one. It has a learning curve to problem solving, but if you are somewhat techno savvy, you should be OK. I do not know if my non-techno savvy husband could have set this up since it requires an online setup. He has, however, learned to use it and is delighted with how it works."
18340,negative,positive,Not as described. This is not vga to hdmi. This is hdmi to vga. It doesn't work in reverse.
4219,negative,positive,I brought this unit & i lost my channels. my antenna works better without it!!!!
30134,positive,negative,This is a genuine Sony product for my Sony HDR-PJ810 camcorder. It replaced the one I lost. It works great.
9526,positive,negative,"These work great, and help to keep earphones in place which was previously difficult with just the ear wings."
9014,negative,positive,"Update 8/26....Yeah, these do not hold a charge anymore! I thought they had died pretty quick the other day but I figured maybe I left tgem in by accident...No. I have fully charged them three times and every single time they hard NO charge by the time I made it to the gym the next day. Yes, I did make sure they were turned off. I will not buy again at this point or recommend.  I thought these were okay so far. The don't stay securely in my ears when I'm running intervals. They slide around, and I've tried each tip(especially the right ear as the volume/song/power control buttons weigh that side down).  I am playing around with the position because maybe I just need to find the sweet spot. They connected easily to my phone but the bluetooth range is not as far as I expected. I had better range with super cheap earphones ($10-$15) I found on another site.The sound is decent, but I got better bass from those aforementioned earphones. I did get these for a lightning deal for $19.99 so it's okay. I would not buy them again for the current price of $30+. If you only need them for walking or weightlifting, these work well, but running..No. I've been using these for about about 5-6weeks, at this point, and they have held up well to sweat and seem sturdy."
29146,negative,positive,"Would give a 0 star if we could. Using money we got from our wedding gifts we bought 2 of these speakers to pair together, and wow do we hate them. I thought at first the design is different and neat and the sound was good and comparable to other bluetooth speakers. We also liked the fact that we could link them together to use one in the house and one outside was great too. The problem though is both do NOT hold a charge ever! We could charge them, which takes hours and hours and hours and when we go to use them if they have just been sitting and not used they have to be charged again! If they need to be charged you can't have them plugged in charging and listen to your music simultaneously because the lady will constantly interrupt and say &#34;battery low&#34; Hate these!"
3705,negative,positive,"Wonderful packaging and the telescoping antennas are amazing.  Unfortnately, there are no instructions and the web site offers a myriad bits of intriguing information, but there does not appear to be any software that functions with Windows 7.  25 bucks up in ... wavelets!"
15494,negative,positive,"I bought 2 of these last year (2014) but didn't need to use them. This year, I am in Europe and was ready to put them into action. They don't work. They don't fit into the outlets in Italy. The prongs are too thick. The adapters I bought 40 years ago are perfect!"
20418,positive,negative,"Panasonic RPHJE120R In-Ear Headphone, Red ..came with extra ear pieces to fit different ear hole sizes. Sound is great works with cell phone, tablet and laptops. Stylish. Would certainly buy again."
18901,positive,negative,"This HDMI cable does not support ARC or HDMI control of external devices. If you don't need that, this is a mediocre cable that will suffice, especially if you get it bundled in with Cheetah mounts. Go with the Amazon Basics HDMI cables instead. They are inexpensive, high quality, and support all available HDMI features (I don't know if they yet support 4k pass through, but I don't have a need for that as of yet).<br />EDIT/UPDATE: Twisted Veins just contacted me and told me they read this review. The rep told me that this had been a manufacturing defect on a large batch of their cables, and she immediately processed a 2nd-day air shipment of a new cable that she said was guaranteed to support ARC and CEC. So, if you receive a bad cable, call Twisted Veins directly and report it; they seem very willing and ready to ensure that people are happy with their products. I originally gave this a two star rating, but now I give it five stars, the fifth star specifically for the friendliness and helpfulness of the customer service agent who reached out to me and sent me a free replacement cable. I was not asked to revise this review."
7453,negative,positive,Dis balanced headphones. Some problems with jack
18929,positive,negative,"Works very nice. Power on volume is default to max, but we adjust the volume from the phone and never touch the unit itself."
11400,negative,positive,"The sound is awesome for such a small speaker. The problem is that it won't keep a charge. I have had two now, and the problem remains the same. When JBL fixes this problem, I will give it a 5star rating."
22097,positive,negative,Great till it just stopped charging.
6913,positive,negative,The package came complete as promised.
24563,positive,negative,Not bad
21964,positive,negative,They all worked.
22060,negative,positive,Could not tell the difference between this cord an a $10 one or better yet a free one from Dish/DirecTV on 2 different TVs (Samsung 1080p 120hz or Sharp 4k 240hz).  Would not suggest buying this.
2998,positive,negative,My husband is using it in his car to connect his Iphone 6 to the stereo and it works properly!
10919,positive,negative,I ordered these batteries after looking at the number inside of my cordless phone in the battery compartment. These batteries work great! It really pays to get the batteries specifically made for your set of cordless phones. I did try a cheaper off brand before I ordered these. The cheaper batteries stopped fully charging and then went dead all together pretty quick.
30070,positive,negative,"This is our 2nd Logitech Smart Radio. The first one was damaged. We first ordered the Grace brand radio as a replacement because it was significantly cheaper, had a larger display, etc. Bad mistake. It would only stream the radio for a minute or two and then indicated it was buffering but the radio would rarely come back, so the Grace radio was returned.<br /><br />Then I ordered this Logitech UE radio and had it set up in under two minutes. All is well again. We don't have buffering problems and the sound is great. I don't understand why this was discontinued by Logitech because it's such a great product. We love it."
20189,negative,positive,It turned out to be a lot thicker than I expected.
8500,positive,negative,Top 1 Product. Top 1 Service.
19024,positive,negative,Needs App to work correctly.
6890,negative,positive,It'a not the size of my bluetooth.
1521,negative,positive,NON RECHARGEABLE. What's the point?  Wanted them for small flashlight. They must be for a different application. Who'd know?
19526,positive,negative,These headphones are amazing. After trying several similar headphones including the Band and Olufsen H8 these are clearly the superior product. You will not be disappointed.
1745,positive,negative,What a wide range of sound from such a small device!  Bluetooth is clearly the way to go when you're on the go.  I use this to get music going in the morning as I prepare to go to work and sometimes I take it for the office.  It's a very small plastic box with a big wide sound (think Bose).  You'll be amazed at how loud this thing gets and I can't figure out how they got this little thing to deliver the BOOMING bass.  The sound is crisp and clean.  You can't go wrong with this one.
1356,positive,negative,Works 50 feet away after upgrading to firware 2.0.7
4973,negative,positive,Just getting around to my review after a month so I apologize. The delivery was pretty quick which I can definitely appreciate it's just the product itself is the problem. Honestly the$10 skullcandy jibs I bought for my wife sounds much better than these do. Not sure how but the ones I bought from the store for my wife have much better base depth and clarity. I had high hopes for these ink'd 2 ear buds but they just don't compare to their more inexpensive versions.
2252,positive,negative,Its cute and still works
18841,positive,negative,Was passed on to a relative. No feedback yet.
25313,positive,negative,Get what you see. Worked as advertised
20007,positive,negative,"Best alarm clock ever. I have always had a hard time getting in the mornings. this beauty has two alarms, adjustable tones, and the dreaded bed shaker!! I get use to the sound of my alarm and can sleep through it, having the ability to change the sound keeps this one baby my bedside. On rough weeks I can set both alarms so I can get up on time. I recommend this alarm for anyone that is not a morning person.<br />On a side note, if you have roommates or live with someone you might want tho give them a heads up about the alarm. I've been told the bed shaking feature rattles the walls of the house. I don't believe them cuz I've slept through just the shining feature."
14225,positive,negative,It truly doesn't get tangled. :)
19371,positive,negative,This item was on time and fit well on my tv was everything the article description said.
19817,positive,negative,"I had some larger files that required archiving and these seemed like a logical low cost option from a reputable brand. I was able to successfully burn 7 discs until I reached a large 42 gb file that I wanted to archive to blu ray. I got the error unable to burn disc and got a coaster. I though it might have been a dud so I tried a second disc and now I have 2 coasters. It wast my Asus drive's fault because it was working until that point and could still read the freshly burned discs. I was reading online to her users experience similar issues with Windows burning blu ray discs with large files, due to a bug in Windows 7 burning software. Out of desperation, I downloaded CDburnerXP and it worked on the last disc in the package! The print area seems to work great with my Epson XP620 small-in-one with disc printing function. The discs come out looking like what you get from a professionally produced disc, without that risks associated with CD stompers applying stickers to discs.<br /><br />Long story short; download CDburnerXP and buy a printer with disc printing capability and you'll be fine with these discs."
28454,negative,positive,"I picked this stereo up from my local Costco. While a good value for the money, I'm not happy with the performance. I've experienced the same picture cutout issues and now have a dead surround sound speaker port (won't work at all). After wasting time changing speaker wire and the speaker itself, I figured out its the receiver causing the problem. Keep in mind that this unit is only 4 months old!  Not happy. Bringing back to Costco!"
29330,negative,positive,break too easy
30477,negative,positive,These worked in my van exactly 1 day!
25246,positive,negative,"With TV ears I can hear 99.5 percent of what they are saying. I couldn't come close to that before. If you are hard of hearing, wear a hearing aid and have difficulty hearing what actors are saying because of background  music, which they seem is necessary for some reason, please try TV ears. Believe me it is well worth the money."
21974,negative,positive,"I would love to like this, and maybe I will eventually, but now I'll have to wait another month for it to show up and then like it or LOVE it.<br /><br />Lookin' forward to September!!!"
14171,negative,positive,do not waste your money---the built in antenna in most flat screen tvs work just as well---wish is not that good!
22278,positive,negative,I just brought it from Walmart its working my Dell Inspiron 3000 Series Laptop enabled Bluetooth works sound in wireless above 30 Feet and as my Eclipse Supra Fit MP3 Player & HP Stream 7 Windows 8.1 Tablet has enabled Bluetooth Devices working
14526,negative,positive,"There is lot of irritating noise in audio, Display is Ok. Not sure whether it supposed to do so or its just my product aweful"
22362,positive,negative,My laprop is finally back in service.  I am very grateful for the parts I lost.
6561,positive,negative,"I have an iHome color-changing speaker with an iPod dock. It is very sensitive about the convertion cables it will allow. This cable will play my iPod Shuffle and iPhone through the iPod dock, and that literally rocks! I have also begun to carry it in my purse, because I've learned that my friends have stereos with docks, and this cable works with those docks too. I highly recommend this male 3.5mm to iPod dock female cable."
20386,negative,positive,"Wow, I wouldn't have guessed this but these are the very best headphones I've ever used and, at the same time, the most disappointing.  Upon first opening and trying the Jlab Epic Bluetooth headphones I was in love.  The sound was amazing and the memory wire fit me like no other active headphones ever have.  On the charger the headphones go and time to get ready for a run.  Here's where it falls off the cliff.  I walk outside and startup my devices.  All I hear is my audio chopping in and out.  The phone is on my armband, we're talking about maybe 12-14 inches of separation between my Galaxy S6 and the Epic's.  What good is a super comfortable and fantastic sounding pair of headphones if they cant make a simple 1ft connection.<br /><br />...had a terrible run, frustrated the whole time.  Looks like I'm going back to the Jaybirds.  Too bad, I'm a big JLab fan."
22441,positive,negative,"Following the inevitable demise of the exceedingly fragile Apple TV remote, we were blessed with this affordable alternative which merely required AAA batteries and all is right with the world of entertainment."
23865,positive,negative,Works right out the box
7315,negative,positive,This speaker works about 7% of the time (regardless if I'm using it through Bluetooth or connecting it with the cable).
23338,negative,positive,"Probably a good product, but was not what I was looking for."
13102,positive,negative,My wife in the hospital with a joint TV shared. Got her a small personal tv and with this antenna gets all local channels<br />Robert C.
28032,negative,positive,I loved this speaker at first. Worked great for 2 weeks. I was so impressed with the sound quality and easy of use....and then it just stopped working. Such a disappointment!
17278,positive,negative,Good for cheap. Not going to win any sound off competitions or out them in your recording studio. But decent. low noise for the money.
21895,positive,negative,I use these to rebuild the dead battery packs on my Garmin GPSs.  Big savings
22451,positive,negative,"I'm no expert on sound quality and truthfully don't even care about that part much.  I use these for transcribing meetings into minutes so as long as there's no loud static or clicking I wouldn't know.  But as to comfort, I tried several pairs before breaking down and spending the money on these.  I used to end up with serious headaches  every time I sat down to work.  These are nice, completely comfortable, and allow me to concentrate on the meetings instead of whatever chaos is going on around me.  No headaches."
16328,positive,negative,I went to their website instead and found that navigating through Underwateraudio.com was very easy but it was nothing compared to their awesome customer service. I emailed them one morning with a load of questions and within 15 minutes I got a response that not only answered my questions but elaborated on them. I was able to find out everything I needed to know and more within 40 minutes. Keep it up guys!
17865,positive,negative,I was wanting a needing a record player but wasnt too sure this would meet my desires. But once put it to use couldnt help to smile and have a content heart.
4182,positive,negative,"It was the correct order,  and was delivered on time."
18119,negative,positive,I was not able to use it for the intended purpose.
28598,positive,negative,NO MORE CRACKING PLASTIC WIRES!!!
6600,positive,negative,Unlike energizer i leave these things around after charging them and they still have power after 3 months
12725,negative,positive,I just got a Xbox one and I was so happy but it turns out they only have HDMI inputs. So I was looking and found this I ordered it and was so happy when It got here but it didn't even work
13332,positive,negative,Works without modification on a Lenovo yoga 3.
29432,positive,negative,Exactly what I thought they would be..with gold connections.
13099,positive,negative,They're audio jacks and they work
22570,negative,positive,Tough to get in ear.  Doesn't block much outside noise
27032,negative,positive,"I don't like this product and don't know why so many good feed back.<br /><br />This one looks cheap, the main issue is that you can't adjust once you have done."
6793,negative,positive,"This product was placed in a box with a bag of dog food and bounced around until it got to my mailbox.  The dog food was fine, but the package of disks was all over."
3689,negative,positive,Does not do its job.
22329,negative,positive,Did not help my HD receiption.
20320,negative,positive,How does a subwoofer manufacturer create a pair of headphones with no bass at all. Highs are crisp but here is absolutely no bass.
17398,positive,negative,Have been using Sony Walkman for years to listen to ball games.  This one beats the Walkman.  You don't have to lock the buttons for fear of the channel switching if you bump one of the preset buttons.  I listen at night and the unit turns off by itself if I fall asleep.  Reception is good and uses any ear buds as the antenna.
30283,negative,positive,"Great sound quality, cheap material."
28174,positive,negative,works like magic
30491,positive,negative,Quality cable if your application requires a short length.
8450,positive,negative,Now I can hear the classics that are not in any other format.
433,positive,negative,Works better than the remote it replaced.
21884,negative,positive,"After installing this antenna, we can no longer view channels that we could before from a simple antenna from Best Busy.  We will be throwing this into recycle. Do not purchase"
18116,negative,positive,The sound isn't clear
29187,positive,negative,"Literally I went from 6 broken up channels to 24. Switched from an amplified rca to this,  best move I've made.  Bought to order another one for the bedroom."
3958,positive,negative,"It was not the right one, but the matter has been taken care of"
18869,positive,negative,"Worked perfectly. My new TV has only an optical audio output.  I had not used one before but I prefer running sound through my stereo so I had to get with the times.  I installed this cable to a digital/ analog audio converter then into my stereo.  Worked right off and hasn't given me any trouble in its first month.<br /><br />If you cannot figure out that the cable has plastic protective covers on the ends for shipping, then it may not be for you.  Otherwise, it's just what you are looking for."
12678,positive,negative,"I purchased this little speaker so that I could bring it with me when travelling.  For the first 8 months it worked just great but after 8 months kept malfunctioning.  The battery was not charging and I would hear the beeping sound indicating a low battery above the music.  I thought I'd be out of the money I spent on it nearly a year ago but I was pleasantly surprised when, on a lark, I got in touch with customer service.  Not only were they courteous but helped me troubleshoot on the phone when I called them.  I returned my speaker and they sent me a new one within 2 weeks.  Super easy to interact with."
12840,negative,positive,"Thought this would be a nice way to enjoy a few old records without spending a ton of money. Speed of play was way too fast, belt keeps popping off, it does not even turn on consistently. Sound quality was not great, from what I could tell at chipmunk speed, but I didn't expect great sound for the price. No response from trouble ticket left on manufacture site.  Returning."
28661,negative,positive,Cheap HDMI cables and that's the best thing I can say about them they do function but they definitely seem jeep and of inferior quality I would not recommend this product
2255,positive,negative,"Works only from a/v side to hdmi, not other way around."
3960,positive,negative,"Really amazon, you asked To rate this? . It's a cord,  you stick one end in your phone and the other in your aux jack. Bamm,  done."
3314,negative,positive,"incredibel loud power on and pairing sound; sound quality not good - buy bose, you'll get more value; did not return it because of high shipping cost from Europe"
28121,negative,positive,shipping was fast and on schedule but the product is not good at all.<br />I'm running a TV about 30' from the control box and needed to extend the hdmi cable a few feet to route it so it was not sight.<br />When I added this the picture was not stable with either cable.  Both acted the same way.<br />When I touched it or turned on any appliance the picture would go in and out.  Without this cable it worked just fine.<br />I ended up putting in a much longer direct cable and coiled up the extra.<br />Just touching the cable made the picture drop in and out (much like static).<br />Don't believe the shielding is that great on these....<br />I would not buy it again.
15773,positive,negative,"very good, but the line should be longer"
19133,positive,negative,It worked well for a few uses them suddenly did not work anymore. I would not purchase it again.
25914,positive,negative,"Took about 2 hours from opening box to watching our mounted 55&#34; TV. We did however have a teething 10 month old to juggle with on top of mounting our TV, so that took up some of the time too. Mount is VERY sturdy. I would buy again!"
2380,negative,positive,"It wads not what I was looking for, And  I does not work very good."
13190,negative,positive,Not intuitive to use at all.
1491,positive,negative,must have if your going to be out in the sun ..DJI inspire1 owner
29327,negative,positive,Rubber ear plugs covers don't stay on and have lost them. The ear attachment also comes off and that has been lost. There are too many parts that don't attach well. Great idea but bad execution of a product.
13602,positive,negative,"My remotes fit the slots well, and the unit is heavy enough that it won't tip. It matches our furniture. Good item."
6501,positive,negative,"Returned to Amazon description of product and it says it does charge D cell batteries, just neglects to say you need to purchase an adapter. I guess it got lost in the translation from Chinese to English. So, I'll be buying an adapter :)"
24158,negative,positive,"These are not $200 headphones that you can get for a steal at $11.25.<br />They are a cheap pair of headphones.<br />Functional, but not high quality."
14766,positive,negative,Works so that's a win
4309,positive,negative,"Only bad thing, it took fooooooooorever to arrive."
15687,positive,negative,kept from spending 340.00 for a new unit.
28974,negative,positive,"Headphones were very uncomfortable.<br />To hear them in factory environment I had to shove earplugs into my ears and then put the headphones over my ears. ..defeating the purpose of bone conducting technology.  The high tones were lost and only deeper tones came through.  Someone with a smaller head in a quiet environment might appreciate these...they were well made and the replaceable battery is huge vs aftershocks maybe 4 hours if charge, but the didn't work well for me."
21285,positive,negative,Just as good (if not better) than the OEM charger that came with my tablet.  The 6.5ft cord was well built and long enough to charge my tablet from the couch.  The 2 foot OEM cord that came with the tablet is too short and pretty worthless unless your sitting right next to an outlet.
17993,positive,negative,"Finally, a quality Bose headphone cable: and it's aftermarket. I bought my QuietComfort 15's in used condition, but the Bose-issued cable was garbage: it kinked after a few weeks and there was this awful crackling sound every time I tried to listen to music. This aftermarket cable is a heavier-gauge, wider, and higher quality cable than the Bose. It's definitely worth the extra $7 over the original, I can use my $250 headphones again."
15840,negative,positive,Very cheap. They ripped at the seem after a couple of usage at home. Also they did not align to the original holes on the beats
28727,negative,positive,It only gives me 8 HD channels.
19467,negative,positive,It's way too long and nobody needs such long wire for the headphones. I have to keep it tied up to use it with my headphones and not look like a fool.
59,negative,positive,"While I like the remote operation of this unit (allows me to reset the wireless router and modem that I hard-wired into a room - before our kid was born and I had to give up my office), the problem is that the remote part doesn't always work.  I will say that the problem is not with the remote, but with the unit itself.  For whatever reason (appears to be completely random, I can't tie it to one event like power outages), sometimes it will not allow the remote to turn the unit off or on.  That can be pretty frustrating when I determine that I need to reboot the router at 11pm after the kid is asleep.  Nice idea, nice looking product, but I'm afraid that it just doesn't work like it should, and so I will be buying a replacement."

13209,positive,negative,"An HDMI chord that's cheap and actually works, can't really ask for anything more."
4591,positive,negative,I bought this to replace my boostwaves antenna control box. This one works better than the boostwaves box the picture is better and the box has weight so you know that it wont fall off your tv stand when some one walks by. SO GET THE ABLE SIGNAL CONTROL BOX TO REPLACE THE BOOSTWAVES CONTROL BOX
30630,positive,negative,Retractable!
23597,positive,negative,"I don't know anything about all that technical mumbo jumbo that others are talking about.  All I know is that they sound pretty good. I am not too rough on them because they are pretty fragile. I only use them at the gym two or three times a week so for me it serves my purpose. I charge them up after every use.<br /><br />Up until a few years ago, I was the only dope who didn't know that devices like these can be charged simply by plugging them into any USB port on your computer. I got a whole lot of extra usb chargers for sale if any one is interested.  :-)"
9378,positive,negative,"Got as a gift for my son, vinyl is coming back."
3872,negative,positive,Ran it from my HDMI cable box to and older Sharp Aquos TV. It didn't work.
4205,positive,negative,"This thing is incredibly loud for it's size.  For $15, it's a no brainer."
18192,negative,positive,"Great quality of sound for the price. I like that it lets ambient noises through.  I wear these during weight lifting,  running,  rowing,  and other forms of cardio.  Biggest issue - my second pair just broke due to the ear piece wire becoming disconnected.  If that wouldn't happen I'd be a happy customer."
10914,negative,positive,Not quality
13497,positive,negative,"This little guy is amazing. I forgot to take it out of my gym shorts once, and when I discovered it, figured it was time to hop back on Amazon to buy another... but hold on a second, this damn thing still worked! I realize I just got lucky, but that's just amazing!"
23378,positive,negative,I get several channels with this antenna.
18709,positive,negative,Bringing in the reception.
29818,positive,negative,"I am more than satisfied with this unit, it replaced a Pioneer CD recorder that I bought back in 1999 and it seems to have the same functions that the old unit had."
9880,positive,negative,"now I don't have to open th pc just to charge my device, thanks!"
10071,negative,positive,Not the best quality. Broke after 4 time used
10520,positive,negative,I'm very disappointed that these are not Prime eligible. I think I will have to pass.
14957,positive,negative,Trying to get in contact with you because you give 180 day warranty and it only last about 45 day and need to replace
21863,negative,positive,"This product looks good, came in a nice package too. Cable looks thick and nice. Ideal for someone to explain how VGA/HDMI looks like. Because this doesn't work. Unless you want to showcase, don't buy this. It doesn't recognize any of our computers, and we have all kinds."
25785,negative,positive,"For this unit to work as designed, ALL input devices (Netflix) must have power on/off capability as it will automatically switch to the &#34;on&#34; device.  Since Netfix &#34;boxes&#34; are always on, you have to manually unplug or pull the power cord to use other devices.  Probably works great for other applications, but not mine.  Another one for my collection of unusable devices."
28062,positive,negative,"The best workout headphones. They don't mess up when you sweat, they stay on your ears, they sound fine and they're cheap. What else could you want?"
9355,positive,negative,Neat item. Keeps my earphones neat and untangled
5217,positive,negative,Defiantly worth it
610,positive,negative,NONE
22105,negative,positive,The seller was great but this antenna is not designed or tuned to be a tri band transmit antenna. SWR is reading 2 to 3 on all 3 of the ham bands it should cover.
23976,positive,negative,Fantastic product. I swim upwards of 6 hours a week in the pool swimming laps and this ipod has been an absolute game changer.
15869,positive,negative,6 of these in my house gives you access to charge all our iDevices AC/USB all at once. Couldn't do with out this product & wouldn't want to.
11578,negative,positive,This one isnt working.  Need a replacement
3375,positive,negative,"THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT IN THE WHOLE WORLD...AT LEAST FOR ME. MY BODY SEEMS TO EXUDE ACIDIC SWEAT. i USE A LAPTOP AND ONE DAY I LOOKED DOWN TO NOTE THAT THE AREA AROUND MY MOUSE ON THE LAPTOP IS BEING FRIDED RIGHT AS I USE. IN A TOTAL Pnic of FRIGHT, I started looking on amazon to see what i could use on my treasured red computer. i found this keyboard cleaning kit. It was a real MIRACLE....in my sight. it cleaned up the keyboard. Then i moved on to some totally resistant mold under the sink and it got that too.<br />This also gets rid of the irritating day to day things such as cat hair.<br />I TOTALLY LOVE IT AND PLAN TO ALWAYS HAVE sOME ON HAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
10898,negative,positive,"I bought one of these speakers about a year ago, and it was great and we loved it. So when I forgot / lost ours at the beach, I figured its worth buying another one. So I did, and not happy at all with the product I received. The product box was damaged (not shipping), the speaker was just rolling around in the product box, there was no packaging to hold it in place, no manual, no clip and it was dented and sounded luje the speaker was blown. Again I bought this before and know how my first one came. Not happy!!!!"
8896,positive,negative,"The RCA web site said that this was the antenna that I should get.  I was initially not getting any reception with the antenna so I put a TV with a short cable on the antenna and was receiving 50 channels, so I ended up getting and putting on an antennas direct CDA8 8 way HTDV amplifier on it and was receiving great signal on all TVs in the house.  I did cap off the unused terminals on the amplifier with 75 ohm male terminators to eliminate any stray signal loss."
24250,negative,positive,The cable did not work .... it is not of good quality
9055,positive,negative,"We got this so we would pickup Atlanta stations.  We are Southwest of the towers, -40 miles.  The first one Didn't work. Had to order a 100 mile range this one.  We get everything but ION, However their tower is Northeast of the rest.  We get three PBS stations so our dog is counting to 10...We are ordering the preamp to see if we might get ION...Praying"
1533,negative,positive,Feels cheap but looks nice it fit rite onto my Playstation 4 real good the fan very annoying  and loud I really could not see if my controller was charging at all
14618,negative,positive,The sound not good i.m no recomend dis produd
6667,negative,positive,Speakers die fast
3947,positive,negative,"I just received this electronic player. I tested the sound using  mp3 music on a USB 32 Gb thumb drive with hundreds of songs on it. Not too bad. I intend to use this player in my truck, My radio/CD player does not have a USB port. I tried it in my truck while driving and it was loud enough to hear the music over the noise of the engine and road. I don't play my music in my truck very loud so this is good enough. I mounted it inside the cup holder. I face it to the side of the holder it sounds better that way.  The instructions are not great which is typical of these types of inexpensive devices. The comments  and questions on Amazon are the best source of information for this device. The player comes with a cable with one end that is a USB plug to connect to a USB charger (not furnished) or the computer for charging- the other end of the furnished cable is a mini USB plug that connects to the mini USB connector on the player to charge it. The battery lasted a few more minutes than 3 hours. Not bad! Strange it can charge from the house USB voltage adapter and play at the same time. But that does not happen with the USB charger in the car, I will try another car USB charger, maybe that is the problem.  I will test the blue tooth next. I am hoping I can use this in the car with my phone. I notice it has a tiny hole for the speaker. I hope it works. This speaker is way better and louder than the laptop or table so it a good way to use it as a wireless speaker for both.  Well I had it six months and the speaker no longer get the USB mode so I can't play my mp3 sounds from thumb drive-dumber. Bummer- But the blue tooth still works. So as wireless speaker to my laptop and surface table its still good.  I still want to use it in my car with the USB thumb drive so for 13 bucks I bought another one for my car.I got my second one -this one is better than my other one it is much louder."
22771,negative,positive,This was a good product. I received it very quick.
29809,positive,negative,Works just as i thought for my altima
18960,negative,positive,"Alot of feedback, not happy at all... replaced it w Vizio sound wireless sound bar I'm super happy w that... 100000 times btr than this pyles..."
21524,positive,negative,"I made the mistake of buying the wrong item. Apparently this is for use in the UK, not the USA. My fault, no reason for me to believe it doesn't work as it should. Was delivered quickly."
15143,positive,negative,"Interesting trust is in the heading of this item, as its very trust worthy and dependable. Ive had it for years now (one of my first purchases from the big A) and it hasn't failed or incompletely charged a single battery nor has it overcharged or exploded any (even when I'd forgotten and left it on overnight). However I can't verify for any other battery type but 18650s so keep that in mind."
10341,positive,negative,"This product is absolutely fantastic...once it's from Amazon, it's got to be good!"
23159,negative,positive,Unsure of why I purchased this. Confused how to use it.
18760,positive,negative,It Works perfect...even better than de orginal remote control that got ruined.  With this remote control the TV responds faster...
31,positive,negative,"OLD: Arrived with 4 screws short. So one of the stands is practically useless...which means the stand pair is useless. waste of my hard earned $   Update: The customer service came through, and I am making the update as promised....a little late but still. The stands are brilliant and my wires well hidden"
3264,negative,positive,"Like the head line said not as pictured.  The one you will get has the amplifier built n to the line of the antenna.  So the amp must be located where the antenna is.  Not good if there is no outlet in the area you plan on putting the antenna.  I really only wanted the antenna, but the antenna and amp were only a few dollars more so I figured to buy this and get an antenna that I could use sometime in the future."
25483,positive,negative,AAA+++ just as ordered!
6621,negative,positive,Hyped way beyond what it will do. Way over priced. The $30 dollar one at WAL MART is every bit as good. I have an old Radio Shack &#34;Rabbit Ears&#34; that does a better job.
2988,negative,positive,This product is not a good purchase for anyone interested in a wireless headset with microphone capabilities.  The microphone is an addon that isn't part of the original packaging and requires you to clip it to your shirt.  The headphones themselves have an unusual pinout that you need to stick into your headphone jack of your computer or your phone which makes it awkward to use.  The headphone cans themselves are not well padded and they don't fold up very well.  For almost the same price you can buy the Logitech G930 which is what I'm about to do.
25612,negative,positive,Plain and simple: it does NOT work as described.
686,positive,negative,works!
28276,negative,positive,"The adapter works very well,no problems. Thank uyou."

415,negative,positive,Not happy
6874,negative,positive,terrible quality and not easy to slip pen into.
26914,negative,positive,These are Lithium batteries.  NOT Lithium Ion.  Lithium are NOT rechargeable.  Lithium Ion ARE rechargeable.  The seller doesn't know the difference.    [...]
18528,negative,positive,"The sound from these speakers - when they work -  is great. I was really quite impressed. But, despite what is said, they are not easy to set up. They do not stay set up. They are totally unreliable! From one hour to the next, I don't know whether they will work or not.<br /><br />From a positive standpoint, I have called Sonos twice. In both cases, the representatives I spoke with were pleasant friendly, and helpful. They took their time and resolved the current issue. BUT, the problems keep coming, I shouldn't have to keep calling to get these things to work.<br /><br />My iPhone often cannot find the Sonos system that exists and has been used. It has been a very frustrating experience. I bought these two basically to get a feel for the Sonos system. I really wanted them to work because I intended to expand the system to many rooms in the house. If two speakers in a single room are not reliable, how can I expect a multi room system to be reliable? The sound may be great but the Sonos system is simply more trouble than it is worth. I have tried. I have been patient. But, I have wasted enough time. If I could still return these speakers I would. I will look at other systems."
9922,negative,positive,Adapter did not function as I needed.
