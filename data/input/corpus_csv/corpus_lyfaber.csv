Blessed John Duns Scotus.",256
"I have written on the topic as well recently (see the first blog entry of the
year), so I have a few points of criticism.",121
"One is that McGrath makes no mention of Christian Wolff, who wrote a natural
theology that was quite influential on the continent. Indeed, McGrath is
focused on the English understanding of natural theology as closely allied
with natural philosophy and the physical sciences.",275
"This means that McGrath makes no mention at all of Nicolas Bonetus, the first
person to write a _Theologia naturalis_ and assign it a place among the system
of sciences inherited from Aristotle. But perhaps, since this the encylopedia
is electronic, the author will update it later.",282
"More of an oddity than anything else, McGrath treats the natural theology of
Raymond Sebonde under the heading of 'Renaissance and Reformation', though he
notes that it is from the late fiftheenth century, surely part of the medieval
era. And again, Sebonde was writing a hundered years after Bonetus.",301
"We come to Duns Scotus. McGrath devotes only a paragraph to Scotus, and, given
that the English discussion of natural theology and natural philosophy is
predominate, the only doctrine of Scotus that is singled out is the notion of
Haecceity.",241
"> A further development of importance to natural theology was due to the
> Franciscan theologian Duns Scotus and his successors. The concept of
> _haeccitas_ (‘this-ness’) emerged during the fourteenth century as a means
> of capturing and preserving the distinct identity of any particular aspect
> of the natural order. Although this concept was important for the philosophy
> of religion, it was adopted in the nineteenth century by the Jesuit poet
> Gerard Manley Hopkins, who used it as the basis of a heightened
> attentiveness to the individual aspects of nature (Boggs 1997), which is
> particularly evident in his 1877 poem ‘As Kingfishers Catch Fire’.",661
"So no mention of univocity of being, or Scotus' proof for the existence of
God, or the nature of metaphysics and theology. the former doctrine, as is
well known, is treated under the rubric of natural knowledge of God.",218
"In the end it makes an interesting contrast with Milbank and his school, for
whom Scotus is of cosmic catastrophic significance. For McGrath, it seems
Scotus is mainly of interest because of the poetry he inspired.",214

Garrett,  
In re the Scotist group on Facebook:  
The moderator is running a reading group on a Norris Clarke book, and planning
to follow up with an Eric Przywara book. Also, if you ask a question about
Duns Scotus, you tend to get Thomist answers. Oh well. Scholars have good
filters - as long as Scotists do read and comment, it is a valuable resource.  
Jim Given",370
"Hi James, yes I saw that. Maybe I will do a post on Przywara here if I get the
time. He is sympathetic to Scotist ideas, at least compared to other thomists
of his time. But he was writing before there was much scholarship on the topic
for Scotism, so he is a bit off in places.",278

"So back on the theme of where Scotus was born, namely, was he Irish (Scotus,
Hibernicus), or Scottish (Scotus). While it is commonly held today that the
Scottish position has triumphed, there was some criticism on a post from
earlier in the year to the effect that the word ""scotus"" originally meant
someone from Ireland and only later, possibly during Scotus' own time did it
come to mean someone from Scotland.  ",414
"While transcribing the _Additiones magnae_ , a text compiled by William of
Alnwick from Scotus' Oxford and Parisian teaching, I came across the following
sentence, that is obviously sketching a map of Europe and also distinguishes
between Scotland (scotia) and Ireland (hibernia).",280
"This is from the end of Add. II d. 14 q. 4. Even if William of Alnwick may be
expanding on Scotus' text (studies on the Additiones II are in their infancy,
so I don't know if there is a parallel elsewhere in Scotus yet), it shows that
ireland was already being called 'hibernia' by about 1315, close to Scotus'
lifetime.",320

###  Francis of Meyronnes early defense of the univocity of being,65
"Francis of Meyronnes is probably the most influential and important Scotist of
the fourteenth century. His many works survive in hundreds of manuscripts and
many were printed in the early days of the printing press. His commentary on
the _Sentences_ exists in three versions, called 'ab oriente', 'summa
simplicitas' and Conflatus. He became a master in 1323 by decree of the pope
after lecturing at Paris.",406
"My post is about the first of the three commentaries. In the 'ab oriente'
commentary, most likely to be Francis' first discussion of the univocity of
being (given the lack of editions, we cannot be sure; it does not matter much,
however, for Francis tends to recycle his arguments), he establishes a series
of principles, which he calls regulae, and then derives conclusions from them.
basically, the regulae are topical rules or 'maximal propositions' as
explained in Boethius' commentary on Aristotle's _Topics_. It is a fairly
interesting dicussion, concluding with a series of doubts. I translate and
paraphrase these rules and doubts here.",644

"Reposting some of my questions about ideas:  
  
1) One last thing I'm wondering about is that, if we say that the divine ideas
are closer to the divine intellect than our ideas are to our intellect because
they are an accident or changeable or could exist separately from our own
intellect, then this would seem to imply that the divine ideas are more
closely rooted and related to God than our ideas (or maybe the ideas in our
intellect are the same as the divine ideas?) are to our own minds.  
  
One could then say that even the parts of the divine ideas that aren't pure
perfections and don't simply reflect God are still rooted in God and so still
in some way reveal God to us as well - even if not as just a reflection of
God. Maybe through their own uniqueness and NON-similarity to God bringing God
glory precisely because uniqueness is God and rooted in God. What do you
think?  
  
2) This then leads to the possibility that the two aspects of a divine idea -
the pure perfections reflecting God, and the creaturely part that's unique in
itself - are not only compatible but **even complement** each other as well.  
  
Say, when God brings about the New Creation we **won't** see created beings as
nothing more than **reminders** of God like an infatuated girl seeing
everything else in the world as just a reminder of her boyfriend in different
ways - we'll also see each thing as having **a uniqueness** in it that isn't
just a reflection of God. And those two will **complement each other** and
make themselves shine - things aren't **just** reminders of God, but they also
aren't **just** purely unique things without any reflection of God either. In
some way, they need each other and fulfill each other - just as God is both
One and Many in Himself, so too are the divine ideas both reflections of God
AND unique in themselves with non-reflective content.  
  
And since God is also infinitely unique in Himself and is Goodness itself, and
having both aspects present in the content of a divine idea is good, both the
uniqueness of creatures and their similarity to God are rooted in God, and
give **greater glory** to Him.  
  
What do you think?",2166
"As for the divine will and contingency, would a good explanation of it be that
the Will by nature and in its concept is self-determining and can't have a
necessary relation to the contingent (due to only infinite goodness absolutely
determining it), and so even Pure Actuality as a substrate doesn't change
that? This also means that the Will may have a form of contingent actuality,
which isn't potentiality, which makes the idea of God possibly having chosen
differently coherent.  
  
In fact, one could even say that the relation between God and creation is an
intentional relation - a relation of the intentionality of God's acts, which
doesn't depend on creation (so it's not a real relation) but also isn't purely
a logical relation of reason. What do you think?",769
"A mediaevalist trying to be a philosopher and a philosopher trying to be a

"The title above is a book I have been reading lately. usually I will be
excited for a month with a new acquisition and then the taedium sets in and I

lot of sense to me in either German or English.",355

"Finally, a word of warning: be careful when buying academic books! I bought my
copy from Amazon, which sells it, I found, as a print on demand volume. But
alas, every page of the text, as well as the front and back cover, contains
the stamp ""copyrighted Material"". One would think this could have been
dispensed with, given that there is a copyright page, but no. The stamp even
covers page numbers and sometimes obscures the last line of the text on a
page. So find a used copy, if you want to read this book.",510
"A few questions about Scotism:  
  
1) About haecceity, I've read that it's supposed to be only the individuating
parts of a thing's form, not the parts it shares with other things such as its
essence. In analytical philosophy the term has also come to include the
essence as well, making the haecceity the individual idea of the creature that
includes all of its determining elements - so the universal essence is just a
part of the haecceity, rather than something strictly separate.  
  
So my question is - has any follower of Scotus supported this view of
haecceity where it's basically the individual concept of the thing, where the
essence is a part of the properties contained in the haecceity? Or is this an
opinion distinct from Scotism in general?  
  
2) Regarding God's free will, creation and divine simplicity, an objection
that's sometimes posed is that this would make the created world we have
necessary, and so God couldn't help but create this world. The reason given
for this is that if the decision to create this particular world and/or the
reasons for doing so are intrinsic to God, then they are also a necessary part
of God's being since God is simple and everything in Him is necessary, even if
they are also formally distinct. So if God had decided to create a different
world then we would have a completely different God essentially since what is
intrinsic to God would be different - and if there can be no differences in
God whatsoever, then God wasn't actually free to create this world and
creation is necessary.  
  
Would it be possible to respond to this by saying that since God's will is
free and is formally distinct from the essence along with the divine
intellect, one could say in some way that there would in fact be a difference
in God, but not one that violates divine simplicity? For example, since the
will is formally distinct from the essence, the will's acts of creation could
be different in different scenarios, but the divine essence would still remain
the same, since it's only the will that may contain the difference? Similarly,
the divine intellect which has the reasons for creating this or that world is
also formally distinct from the essence, so even if the divine intellect
presents different reasons to the will, those differences wouldn't be in the
essence formally as such?  
  
Is this an acceptable explanation under Scotism, or would the answer have to
be approached differently? What do you think?",2467
"1\. I have never heard of a Scotist holding this. The individuating difference
is held to be formally distinct from the essence. The divine idea of a
creature might qualify, in that it would have both the essence and the
haecceity.  
  
2\. I think the idea of a possible world would be foreign to scholastic
thought. indivduals might be possible, but not worlds. on scotism, the divine
intellect generates a variety of formal rationes and essences, and their
intrinsic non repugnance determiens what is possible. But the divine will has
to actualize them. So any indivdual might not have been actualized, and
another might have been actualized that is not, but not an entire world as
such.  
  
anyway, you are correct, Scotus and his people would posit a formal
distinction between the intellect and will, so they don't have the modal
collapse problem. but it is a weaker sense of divine simplicity to be sure. On
the other hand, there is no authoritative statement of divine simplicity
anywwhere, so what does that matter? With Scotus the debate is how much
distinction does the formal distinction posit, as he has several different
formulations.",1149
"I respond not to your discussion of Morris, but to your mention of struggles
with Przywara. I recall great enthusiasm when discovering his Analogia Entis;
followed by a later frustration, slower in offset. Enthusiasm for two reasons:
(1) Przywara seemed to be in the early 1930's in dialogue with many of the
creators; the shapers of twentieth century theology, including Karl Barth and
Martin Heidegger; (2) Przywara convinces one repeatedly by his formulations
that he has a larger vision of which Thomism and Scotism are complementary
aspects. Frustration because of his conciseness of his formulations. (Was he
but another in a Century of Zen Masters? No too much testimony by those we
respect that the effort here is worthwhile.) You remind me here that I must
redouble my efforts to understand Przywara. But I think one must work with a
good biography of Przywara because his importance seems to be contained in his
individual interactions - conversations; letters.  ",973
"1) So Scotists do have a concept of individual ideas that fully incorporate
everything about the creature - which would be the divine idea, or the
particular idea as such?  
  
Haecceity would just be one of the necessary parts of the particular concept
of each divine idea?  
  
2) So could Scotists say that maybe there would be differences in God had He
decided to create different individuals, but that these differences **don't**
violate divine simplicity or immutability? The modal collapse argument is that
if nothing in God could have been otherwise because of divine simplicity, and
the intention + reasons for creating any particular creature are internal to
God, then God couldn't have refrained from creating the creatures He did, and
so the existence of this particular creation is necessary with no other
creatures actually being able to exist at all.  
  
All because the intentions + reasons for creating the particular creatures God
actually did create are internal to Him, and nothing internal to God could
have been otherwise.  
  
But if we accept the formal distinction **and** that God's will is
contingently self-determining, it seems a Scotist could conclude that there
really could be differences in God depending on at least **whether** He
decided to create, if not what particular things He created, precisely because
the Will need not have determined itself to create anything contingent, and
that this in no way violates either divine simplicity or immutability. What do
you think?  ",1512
"  
I have found that one must use any of the words that describe human thought or
understanding with great care in describing God. In particular, God has ideas
of individuals - but how to make sense of this using our understand of human
ideas?(Perhaps the haecceitas of an individual is better understood in terms
of God's willing of an individual, and the significance of its creation in
light of God's plan for all of creation; than in terms of God's ""idea"" of that
individual. More like willing than thinking; more like existence than essence.
But I offer these comments as aids to our understanding; as metaphysical
distinctions, they can be but formal distinctions.)  
  
Further, God has ideas for every individual He might have created. (But
there's no such thing as a nonexistent individual, one says!)I can imagine
these in the sense of undifferentiated aspects of a continuum of Divine
possibility, but in what sense are these individuals? A mathematical
continuum, e.g. a line, can be conceived formally as a set of points, but,
except for a set of measure zero, none of these points can ever be specified
using a finite-length definition or algorithm for their construction. So in
what sense are they individuals?  
  
I simply do not have here even a bare grammar of what things can sensibly be
said. I did read carefully the book, ""Aquinas on the Divine Ideas as Exemplar
Causes,"" by Gregory Doolan at CU; an excellent, very thoughtful book on these
questions. This book is to be credited with the limited understanding I have
of this difficult topic.",1565
"Dr. Sullivan, I have read with interest your considerations on the differences
between Thomistic and Scotistic metaphysics, and share your dislike of straw-
man arguments against Scotus. I too find myself somewhere in between the two
positions, but I have written a short metaphysical work to correct Etienne
Gilson's misconstrual of the Thomistic tradition: ""Existence and Subsistence
in St. Aquinas: Against Gilsonian Metaphysics."" Without adopting the position
of any particular historical Thomist, I have shown that Gilsonian (née
Bergsonian) anti-essentialism is based upon a faulty notion of essence. The
book is priced (with almost no margin for the author) at $5.95. I would also
be happy to send you a free copy and/or hear your opinions at jkalb3@cox.net  
  
In Christ,

"  
Dear Dr. Kalb,  
There is a long tradition of pointing out that Gilson fails to grasp the basis
of Duns Scotus metaphysical position, some asserting that he interprets the
meaning of Duns Scotus' claims in the way that Aquinas might have.I'm sure you
are familiar with the history of commentaries of this kind  
  
What I find to be of crucial importance in the relation of Scotism to Thomism
is what seems to be a basic mutual incomprehension. As a theoretical
physicist, it reminds me of complementarity, i.e., the relation between the
""wave"" picture and the ""particle"" picture of matter that students of physics
must deal with.But unlike the situation in physics, there is no unified
viewpoint that accommodates these distinct pictures of Being.  
  
It is my forlorn ambition to find such a unifying viewpoint, not which
combines these two very different pictures; but rather a larger more general
viewpoint in which these two pictures can both be situated, perhaps as
endpoints of a continuum.",1001
"Wesley,  
  
1\. Right, so a divine idea is the 'creature as known', which contains a
common nature and a haecceity.  
  
2\. on the scotist view, all divine simplicity requires is that one grant that
every thing is 'realiter unum' in God. But formal distinction is compatible
with real identity. the will is a divine attribute, and so could not not be in
God, but it acts contingently regarding creation. it could have refrained from
creating individuals or created different ones. such changes would be within
the contingent will, and even if the act might be distinct from the will, all
would be realiter unum in God. i don't think h owever, that natures could be
otherwise than they are, that is, human being be constituted in a different
way: natures are all thought up by the dvine intellect, which combines them
based on the compatibilities inherent in the nature itself. So maybe, no
goatstag.  
  
James: i have not read the Doolan book, though i have seen his articles which
look good. Scotus, of coourse, has a very differnet view of the ideas than
Aquinas. And in light of univocity, he even at one point suggests that the
divine intellect is quasi passive like ours.  
  
Thanks for the book search engine. I have used it already. Not quite the home
run on this particular book, though, since i live abroad shipping prices often
make the cheap deal not so cheap in the end.",1386
"@Garrett,  
  
2) Interesting - so while the Will would be inseparable from God and
necessarily exists, the contingent acts it does could have been different in
some way?  
  
The immediate objection that comes to mind is that this seems to violate Pure
Actuality - if God's will is contingent and could have acted differently,
wouldn't this imply some potentiality intrinsic to God's will in some sense?
So a contingent act of will that could have been otherwise can't be attributed
to God since it goes against PA?  
  
Another possible objection is that if the contingent act of creation is itself
realiter unum in God, then it's no longer contingent since nothing that is
realiter unum with God could have been otherwise, so God's act of creation /
decision of creating any particular thing is necessary.  
  
Now one could avoid this by saying the act of creation isn't intrinsic to God
or realiter unum with Him, but it also can't be an accident since this would
go against divine simplicity, so it must be wholly extrinsic to God. But if
the act of creation is wholly extrinsic then in what way can it even be
attributed to God, since it is no longer attributed to Him properly as
intrinsic? There would be no difference between this wholly-external model,
and creation just popping into existence uncaused - it seems God is no longer
responsible for creation's existence at all.  
  
What do you think?  ",1412
"Mr. Given,  
  
I do agree, and I would add that Gilson, in his rush to assimilate Bergson's
natural philosophy (in lieu of Aristotle's), also misunderstands St. Thomas's
metaphysics. Gilson's is really a new metaphysics, perhaps inspired by St.
Thomas, but diverging from it in many critical ways. To correct that
misapprehension and return us to a more traditional interpretation was my
essential interest in writing the short tract. Step one for me is to free St.
Thomas from his modern shackles.  
  
My original background is materials science and electrical engineering. It was
only as I began to see the problems with modern physics that I entered deeply
into natural philosophy, and thence into metaphysics. I agree that in most
respects Scotus and Aquinas are complementary. Bettoni was my first
introduction to Scotism, and my reading of Scotus has extended only to my own
philosophical interests. I certainly cannot be called an expert in his
philosophy. However, I believe that his principal theses, understood in the
proper sense, not in the sense Thomists assign to them, are compatible with a
Thomistic framework. As a Catholic, I do not view Scotus as a suitable
standard for the Church, given the smaller range of his thought, its
abstruseness, and the confusing state of the writings he left behind. However,
I think it very important that his new insights be incorporated into a
Thomistic foundation.  
  
I too have sought a unifying viewpoint and I do believe I have found it in a
discipline I call ""Taxology,"" which I have spent the last 25 years developing.
The study of pure metaphysical order effectively works as a material logic of
the transcendentals. Its role is analogous to the role the mathematical
apparatus plays in mathematical physics, except that I use the data of
revelation and traditional metaphysics, rather than the data of the senses.
The formal distinction, haecceity, and the univocity of being all find their
taxological equivalents. If it is something that interests you, we can discuss
it offline at the email I provided. It would take us far astray of this
conversation.",2119
"  
Wesley C:  
  
I think you raise a very basic question that should appear as an exercise in a
textbook on Western i.e., Christian metaphysics:  
If God is omnipotent and can do all things, why is He not characterized by
Infinite Potentiality rather than Infinite Actuality? Intuitively, a human
e.g. is a higher form of being than a rock e.g. because the former has so many
possibilities and capacities compared to the latter. And actualized
capabilities seem often to multiple possibilities, not eliminate them.  
  
Jeffrey Kalb:  
  
I will email you. I have a similar story to yours. I am a professional
physicist and engineer, and an amateur metaphysician.  ",666
"Wesley, I would say it does not violate divine simplicity because the divine
potency in question is not a potency in being, such that the divine being is
composed of potency and act, but rather active potency, which is the ability
of a power to do something. divine simplicity only requires us to reject
passive potency, the ability to be acted upon. even Aquinas incorporates the
doctrine of active potency into his doctrine of creation. So I would qualify
the notion of 'pure actuality' as an actuality of being.  
  
As for the other objection, I would claim that formal distinction is
compatible with everything in God being realiter unum. So the formally
distinct intellect proposes a variety of essences and indivuduals to the will,
and the will chooses to actualize them. How? I would say here with Scotus,
that the will just wills, that is it's job. some things it wills necessarily,
such as the divine nature, and others contingently, creation. the same sole
divine power can have both aspects to its single act of will. In other words,
I don't think I have an answer.",1077
"Mr. Kalb, have you looked at any of the attempts to synthesize Scotus and
abstract his ideas for a broader audience? I am thinking here of Antonius
Andreas, who composed a commentary on the Metaphysics that had a literal
section, taken from Aquinas' literal commentary, and a question commentary,
which paraphrased Scotus' QQ on the Metaphysics.",345
"@Garrett,  
  
  
1) Couldn't one object that an ability's power to do something still implies
potency, so the divine power would then have to be composed of act & potency?
Or that the very concept of ability as we univocally understand it contains
unactualised potentials with regards to its exercise?  
  
2) I wasn't talking about the formal distinction being incompatible with
realiter unum, but that if the act of creation itself is realiter unum in God,
then it must be necessary and can't be contingent, so the divine Will can't
have a contingent aspect internal to it since things that are realiter unum
with God can't be different than what they are.  
  
This seems to follow if we also assume that everything that is realiter unum
in God can't be otherwise - so the distinct formalities in God can't be
otherwise than how they actually are.  
  ",856
"On the other hand, a possible response could be that the Will is by nature
self-determining, and with regards to finite creatable things logically cannot
have a necessary relation towards them.  
  
This is conceptually prior to considerations of pure actuality or whatnot, so
the definition and nature of what will is may show us how its acts are
contingent, or has a contingent element to it.  
  
Furthermore, this doesn't need to conflict with God being Purely Actual since
it's precisely God's infinite actuality that may allow for an abundance of
freedom - His Will can have contingent aspects precisely by being rooted in
pure actuality, which paradoxically implies freedom as infinite actuality
opens up towards an infinite horizon of possible being, since the infinite
maximally self-consistent God can't have a necessary relation to contingent
finite reality. As Aquinas points out, the will is related to things in their
ontology, so since contingent creation has contingent ontology, the Will can't
be related to it necessarily.  
  
What do you think of this?  ",1074

The Desmond quote seems to claim him as another Existential Thomist, i.e.,

In either case, an essential subjective experience. This is Neoplatonist

Scotus. It might be on the Logic museum website, but you can get the link to t
he volume from Sidney penner's website. If you email me, I can send you an
article or two about the text.  
  
Not sure you are right about Desmond. He knows nothing at all about medieval,
at least not when he wrote the present book. He seems to grant the need for
univocity in science, but wants to avoid philosophy collapsing into math or
physics. So he starts with the aristotelian experience, the desire to know,,
but tries to intregrate univocal science with the equivocity of experience. It
may end up as mysticism, though, who knows. I have only read the first two
chapters.",732
"  
Sorry to be presumptuous on Desmond. I have, but have not yet had occasion to
read the book you mention. Your quote, with its ecstatic tones
(""astonishment""), and use of the phrase ""the question of being"" caused me to

with the rest of human experience, I recommend Michael Polanyi's Personal
Knowledge.",380
"Can someone help me with a few questions about Scotus's arguments in ""De Primo
Principio""?  
  
At one point Scotus is trying to prove that God is intelligent, and he offers
this argument:  
  
""4.21 There is a fifth proof for this conclusion, which is based on the fact
that a living thing is better than anything not alive, and among living things
what has understanding is better than what lacks intelligence.""  
  
However, at 4.22 Scotus presents an argument that intellect, love, etc., are
pure perfections and therefore must be in God, etc. He then proceeds to refute
that argument (I'm not convinced of his refutation, btw).  
  
It seems to me like Scotus is contradicting himself here, unless I'm missing a
subtle distinction he's making. He thinks we can prove God is intelligent from
the fact that being intelligent is ""better"" than non-intelligent, but then
seems to argue against that very kind of argument in the next paragraph.  
  
I take ""better"" to refer to ""more perfect"", as in, possessing more actuality,
more power, more irreducible properties. Yet isn't that what one also argues
when speaking of pure perfections?",1138
"@Garrett  
I confess that I have not looked at these works. My current state in life does
not give me the leisure to do that kind of research into secondary sources, so
I will always be a bit out of the loop on current controversies. Truth be
told, my primary interest is not really the synthesis of Aquinas and Scotus.
For me, that is simply the outcome of the convertibility of being and order. I
approach metaphysics in a very different way than either philosopher, though I
interpret and regulate my speculation in terms of their theses.",541
"Wesley, as to 1., Aquinas at least thinks active potency is related to action,
since it is the principle of action, and so it is present in God. But it is
simply an ability to act, not an ability to receive action, which is the sort
of potency that would compromise divine simplicity.  
  
2\. Act of creation. well, there is just one act of will in God. Perhaps there
is an extension of the act from the initial object, the divine essence, to
other objects. A 'protensio' for the will, like there is for the intellect,
according to some. I think you may be right, in that it may be the objects
that account for the contingency, at least that the will, in its single
eternal necessary act, chose to actualize some contingent creatures.",735
"James: thanks for the recommendation!  
  
Unknown: At 4.21 Scotus argues simply from the notions of life and
intelligence to prove that God is intellective and volitive. But note, he does
not call life and intelligence 'pure perfections.  
  
At 4.22 Scotus reports a theory held by others that he then attacks. The
theory simply identifies various perfections as pure perfections conforming to
the Anselmian description. Scotus thinks it is not evident that these other
notions are all pure perfections and there is a dialogue about why he thinks
this. In the end, it seems only the attributes of being are evidently pure
perfections. So 4.21 is specifically tailored to yield the same conclusion as
if he were using pure perfections without calling them such and having to
prove that they are.",796
"  
Thank you very much for your guidance. I have been focused very much on Duns
Scotus' understanding of will. First, it seems both essential and very
difficult to square the Classical heritage about the Boundless and the
Infinite as complete, impassive timeless and unchanging; with the Christian
understanding of a God who loves us, answers our prayers, and feels our pain.
Jesus tells us to pray for all that we need, and that God will answer our
prayers. The New Testament makes God essentially involved with us in a way
that must be intelligible in terms of Scholastic metaphysics. Catholics seem
to favor a God who responds to our prayers and suffers with us. The Calvinist
seem to take a maximally Classical i.e. unchanging and impassive position on
this matter. Second, the question of which modifications of Scholastic
metaphysics necessary to allow for both Divine omniscience and omnipotence;
and with human free will; seem to be few in number. William Lane Craig will
argue in detail that only Scotism and Molinism have this potential. Finally, I
am deeply concerned about the efforts by present ""researchers"" to deny the
reality of human free will as pretext to destroy the open, liberal society,
which is essentially based on the ability and willingness of most citizens to
decide to obey the law and contribute to social well-being. A society of
people unable to control their actions must be a police state. A movement
which includes many senior neurophysiologists and psychiatrists, the Embodied
Mind Theory is striving to create a scientifically defensible understanding of
human free will. Several practitioners have written about this. See e.g. the
book by Guus Lebooy, ""Freedom and Dispositions."" They believe, as i do, that
Scotism allows for a modern theory of free will.  
  
My theme here: Scotist metaphysics is very important as a living accessible
strand of Western philosophy and thought. I wish I had the resources to make
an popular exposition of these ideas. The Calvinist William Lane Craig has
used Molinism to support his form of Calvinism. He writes and lectures widely
to popular audiences about his ideas. But I fear his ideas are compatible with
mainstream theories of unconscious human determinism, i.e., the ""Myth of Human
Freedom.""",2273
"James: thanks for your comment. I was unaware that the anti free will movement
was large enough to be a movment. I see of course the occasional 'gotcha'
sciencey article about this, but usually scroll on by. Well, then, given your
interest, and that of Wesley above, I may try to do some posts on creation and
the will. I have stayed out of this area in my professional writing, mainly
because Scotus' views on the will are contested, and there are still texts
that need to be critically edited.",495
"  
Garrett, there seem to be several distinct topics in play here.  
  
A metaphysically and theologically adequate account of Creation is a complex
and elusive goal. The identification of Creation with the physical theory of
the Big Bang is a very damaging scientistic error. In creation ex nihilo does
not mean creation from nothing in the logical sense, but creation beginning in
a state in which nothing exists except God. Divine ideas and the aether must
be real in a timeless sense. But neither one has distinct existence.  
  
The compatibility of Divine omniscience and free will is a very complex topic
addressed in detail by a number of good books. I have already noted these. The
compatibility of Molinism and Scotism, as possibly the only two accounts of
free will that preserve this compatibility, is addressed in the paper,
''Molina and John Duns Scotus'' by Jean Pascal Anfray.  
  
The Embodied Mind scientists want a neurophysiological account of mind and
brain that is compatible with human free will. But they are scientists not
philosophers and have no one to provide a metaphysical foundation for their
account. It is rather the case that most psychology is materialistic and
naturalistic, and provides no account of authentic free will. Freudianism is a
major class of examples. The physical sciences seek explanations in terms of
physical causation. The basic truth is that accounts of the brain based on the
dynamics of neurons provide no foundation or account of the basic elements of
a description of mind: thoughts, intentions, dispositions, acts of will, and
emotions. This accounts for the popularity of theories of ''quantum
consciousness,'' which seek to account for free will in terms of quantum-
mechanical indeterminacy.  
  
I have not thought systematically about the ""free will deniers."" I note there
are many books and papers supporting this. I also note that many notions in
sociology and criminology seek to prove that racist attitudes and judgments
are preconscious and present in very early life of a child. Theories that
maintain that control of either various types of sexual behavior, or of
violent behavior, and of addictive behavior; are unconscious and not subject
to will are now widespread. These theories are dangerous to a liberal, open
society. I do not maintain there is an organized 'movement' opposed to the
notion of free will. Physical science is predisposed in this manner; and
various social theorists are quite willing to exploit these theories.

I should have included Divine Ideas as a separate category, because it is so
central to these other ideas; and so problematic a concept. I favor Gregory
Doolan's book, ''Aquinas on the Divine Ideas As Exemplar Causes'' on this
topic, both because it gives the best account of the subject I have ever seen;
and also because it provides a basis for comparison of Scotist and Thomist
notions on this topic (even though Doolan is a Thomist) because it includes a

talk about God, or can we also say that the univocity exists in reality as

"@Garrett,  
  
Did you notice my last reply in the ""Was Scotus Irish?"" comments? About the
ideas and some other things? What do you think of it?  
  
@Lee Faber,  
  
Quick question if you have the time - where does Scotus think the ideas are
meant to be located? In the divine essence, or only in the divine intellect
which generates them?  
  
If in the divine intellect, could we extrapolate from this that creation and
created ideas aren't just solely finite reflections of God, but have a sort of
uniqueness to them as well? Since the ideas would be rooted in the intellect
but not the essence, the ideas would reflect God's intellect but not the
essence, and there would then have to be some uniqueness factor that makes the
divine ideas formally unique in themselves in their intelligible content.  
  
In other words, there is something in the divine ideas which **doesn't**
reflect God. Would this be something that's possible to say in Catholic
theology?",964
"Hi Wesley, I'll check the other thread... I am not used to getting comments.  
  
Univocity for Scotus is a property of concepts only. He says God and creatures
are one in concept but agree in no reality outside the soul.  
  
One of Scotus' early followers, Antonius Andreae, held that there was a
corresponding reality between God and creatures, and he never got into trouble
with the church, as far as I know. Mostly, it would cause problems for divine
simplicity, which was considered doctrine as of lateran IV. There must be a
reality that is common to God and creatures and one that is common, so God
will have two realities.  
  
[oh, and lee faber = garrett",665
"@Garrett, When you say it would cause problems for divine simplicity, are you
referring to Antonius Andreae's position of there being a realiy between God
and creatures, or the position that there is something in the divine ideas
that doesn't reflect God, so they aren't purely reflections of God?",297
"Regarding your other remark, I think that is what the ideas are, ideas of
creatures. thus they are contained in God, and so maybe by an extirnsic
denomination are divine, but still of themselves are purely creaturely
intelligible content. What the divine intellect does is generate essences and
pars of essences: rationality, animality, etc., and then combine them where
they are mutually compatible, attaching haecceities probably as well, and
finally the divine will actualizes the whole complex.  
  
I think positing them in the essence causes fewer problems, because then one
can avoid the apperance of change in God, and just say the creature as an
essence exists in the divine essence, and all the divine will does is
actualize it. this way, the divine essence 'shows' the creatable essences to
the divine intellect and will.  
  
varieties of these views were bandied about a lot in the 13th and ensuing
centuies and never condemned, so whether or not they are true, catholics can
hold them.",999
"@Garrett, 1) Would this mean we could possibly have two formal separations
between the ideas and the essence - the essence is formally distinct from the
intellect, and the intellect is formally distinct from the ideas it generates,
so ideas would have a type of uniqueness by this two-step formal separation?  
  
2) From what you say at the end, multiple positions on this issue are
available for Catholics, and the Magisterium hasn't showed any interest in
declaring for or against any of those, so Catholics are free to believe among
them?  
  
3) Now if we accept that the ideas have purely creaturely intelligible content
that makes them truly unique in themselves, would this perhaps undo the
exemplary cause altogether? What we'd be left with is the efficient cause and
some sort of generative cause attributed to the divine intellect, and also
some relation and similarity of the ideas to God insofar as they are rooted
and generated by God.  
  
Would it be permissible to drop the exemplar cause almost completely, or even
fully? Are there any orthodox Scholastics who held such a view?  
  
4) Another important option is to say that the divine ideas are both
reflections of God that are similar to the essence in a finite way, but are
also at the same time unique in themselves or have intelligible content that
isn't purely about God? In other words, both?  
  
Or maybe even that the very unique intelligible content also reflects God in
some way at the same time?  
  
If so, this would mean the two ways of viewing the ideas could be
complementary - God is infinitely unique in Himself and is even Uniqueness
itself in a way, so it's fitting that the unique non-exemplary content of
ideas complement and be connected to the content of them that IS also
reflective of God as well. What do you think?",1814
"1\. yes. the basic condition of the formal distinction is that it obtains
between things that have formal rationes that do not contain each other. So
the formal ratio of the divine intellect would be formally distinct from the
ideas it generates (or cognizes in the essence) and the divine essence. Each
idea would indeed be its own formal ratio.  
  
2\. yes, i know of know magisterial ruling on anything pertaining to the
ideas. Peter Thomae even calls them the 'plura aeterna'. All one has to say is
that God created, the mechanism is up for grabs.  
  
3\. i think we could just identify the creatura intellecta as the exemplar
cause. God still creates by means of it. So we have the divine intellect
producing or constituting the quiddities of creatables, the divine will
choosing which ones to actualize/create. imitation is a secondary
consideration, whihc occurs when the divine intellect compares the idea to the
divine essence (the debate there is whether imitation is what constituts the
idea, Scotus says no, Thomas yes).  
  
4\. That is basically what Peter Thomae says, that the divine essence is like
an infinite intelligible mirror and the essences of creatures are reflected
and shine out of it.  
  
I would still say the ideas have to be formally distinct from God, even if
they are in God. God certainly reflects the creatures, creatures maybe
reprsesent God insofar as they have pure perfections etc. that come from God.",1443
"@Garrett, 3) So the exemplar cause would be the eternal idea of the creature
in God's intellect?  
  
Is the imitability of divine ideas (they imitate God in some way) doctrine, or
just a theological opinion? The same goes for exemplar causality - is it
doctrine, or just common opinion?  
  
  
4) So creatures represent or reflect God insofar as they have pure
perfections. Now if we say that creatures aren't just reflections of God in
their ratios, but have some unique content which doesn't reflect God as well,
would that content have to be outside the category of pure perfections?  
  
Would it be possible to say that the ratios of creatures necessarily have both
an element that reflects God AND an element that doesn't? Maybe even that they
are one and the same element, but with different aspects, one of which is
reflective of God, while the other isn't?  
  ",872
"3\. Wesley, yes, i would say the exemplar cause is the divine idea in the
divine intellect.  
  
All theories of divine ideas are pure speculation and opinion, none of this is
at any level of defined teaching. Some might say that given the general church
recommendation of Thomas, that his views on everything are authoritative in
some sense. But not me.  
  
4\. so, yes, there would be pure perfections in common with God, maybe the
transcendental notions as they are attached to God and creatures, but the
distinctly creaturely part would be the essence plus haecceity.  
  ",577
"@Garrett,  
  
a) Thanks for the clarification! One last thing I'm wondering about is that,
if we say that the divine ideas are closer to the divine intellect than our
ideas are to our intellect because they are an accident or changeable or could
exist separately from our own intellect, then this would seem to imply that
the divine ideas are more closely rooted and related to God than our ideas (or
maybe the ideas in our intellect are the same as the divine ideas?) are to our
own minds.  
  
b) One could then say that even the parts of the divine ideas that **aren't**
pure perfections and don't simply reflect God are still rooted in God and so
are still similar to Him in some way, even if they don't outright reflect Him.
Or that the **creaturely** part of the divine ideas which doesn't reflect God
still in some way reveals God to us as well - even if not as just a reflection
of God. What do you think?  
  
c) This then leads to the possibility that the two aspects of a divine idea -
the pure perfections reflecting God, and the creaturely part that's unique in
itself - are not only compatible but even **complement** each other as well.  
  
c) Say, when God brings about the New Creation we won't see created beings as
nothing more than reminders of God like an infatuated girl seeing everything
else in the world as just a reminder of her boyfriend in different ways -
we'll also see each thing as having a uniqueness in it that isn't just a
reflection of God. And those two will complement each other and make
themselves shine - things aren't just reminders of God, but they also aren't
just purely unique things without any reflection of God either.  
  
And since God is also infinitely unique in Himself and is Goodness itself, and
having both aspects present in the content of a divine idea is good, both the
uniqueness of creatures and their similarity to God are rooted in God, and
give greater glory to Him.

Thank you for discovering this writer for me. I must explore-  
An award named for Andy Warhol ( a most confused Catholic) does not impress
me; but why should one Zen Master not profit from another?  
  
I think the writer's designated central point is at the very center of the
Western philosophical tradition, as was Duns Scotus: WE DO LOSE. WE NEVER GET
THERE. OUR STRIVING TO REALIZE COMPLETE BEING MUST ALWAYS FAIL; WE SET OUT IN
FIERCE PRIDE; STRAINING FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE; STRIVING TO RE-MEMBER THE
FUTURE; EKSTATIS OCCURS; AND THEN WE FIND OURSELVES ALREADY ALWAYS THERE IN
THE PAST.  
TRULY THE BASIC MOTION OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY; ITS PRIMITIVE ACT; IS A TRACING
OUT OF THE ARCHER'S MISSING OF THE MARK, OR HAMARTIA?  
  
*I have been pondering this for decades. Isn't it written out somewhere by Aristotle; this ""paradox of time""? Several good books on this, e.g. Pascal Massie, ""Contingency Time and Possibility: An Essay on Aristotle and Duns Scotus.""  
  
A recurrent conclusion of mine in re Duns Scotus seems to me to be closely
related: Aquinas writes metaphysics for the Afterlife. When we study
metaphysics again, in Heaven, we will realize that Aquinas was exactly right.
But Duns Scotus does Metaphysics for a Fallen Nature; for Those who Walk in
Darkness-  
  
Finally, the answer to the above Paradox of Time is artistic creation; because
the artist reaches for the solidity of the Past; and finds their Creation
approaching them from the Future. The Creation attains the Future, but the
Artist must let it go-  
I don't know if Aristotle tell us about this solution-

To believe as the author seems to that philosophy is about the largest
categories and the most general concepts is to grasp half of the bequest of
classical Greek philosophy. The tension between ""the one and the many"" is at
least as old as Plato.  
Theories of individuation do not contradict theories of general concepts any
more than the essence contradicts the esse.  
  
Put differently, medieval philosophy was not ""contradictory""; rather, it
formalized a pair of tensions within Being; tensions as old as Pythagoras, but
framed very carefully by Aristotle. Tensions that yield the four elements; the
four causes; the four humors.  
  
The notion of philosophy as the search for the highest abstractions seems to
be an essential fruit of modernist philosophical Idealism. (BTW, Duns Scotus
had a lot to say about the Transcendental, too.)

"The author of the piece linked to above rejects the current scholarly view
that Scotus was Scotish. The problem is, the Irish thesis is based purely on
hearsay. There is no positive evidence in the form of a medieval document.",226
"What about the Scottish claim? The author claims that ""Scotus"" could mean
someone from Ireland or Scotland, that we don't know when it changed to mean
only someone from Scotland. Think of the other ""Scotus"", Eriugena, who
unquestionably was Irish. According to the author, people in the thirteenth
century could be described as being either 'hibernicus' or 'scotus' depending
on their racial origins as native Irish or Norman invaders.",435
"But whether or not such a distinction is true or not, it isn't relevant to the
question of Scotus' origins. For we have a contemporary document that contains
enough evidence to show Scotus' Scottish ancestry. This is the adhesion list
of 1303. In the dispute between the pope and the king of France, the king sent
officials to the various religious houses at the university and had them affix
their names to a list accepting the king's claims or denying them. Scotus is
on the list denying. The most recent edition of this list is in Courtenay.",544
"This list describes people from England as 'de anglia,' those from Ireland as
'de hymbernia', leaving 'Scotus' to be Scottish. What is more, the list
organizes people by regions: thus, on the page on which Scotus appears, we
have scholars from the Iberian peninsula, followed by Scotus, the English, the
Irish, and then the beginning of the Germans.",349
"Many thanks for highlighting this article but I honestly don't understand how
you can read it the way you have? Nearly all the 17th Irish historians list
the town in Ireland he came from, Downpatrick in Co. Down, as I believe I
pointed out. I also list three medieval sources, 14th and 15th century, that
state clearly he came from Ireland.  
  
That list that you highlight is the same one I mention in the text. Its not
decisive because Scotus could mean a person of Irish race, hence he wouldn't
necessarily be listed with the other people listed as from Ireland, if they
were Norman.  
  
Its true that its a reasonable way of reading that list to say he is Scottish
and the others are English and Irish etc, but because of the well known and
very widespread use of the word Scotus as meaning a person of the Gaelic race
in Ireland, it isn't as decisive as some make it out to be.  
  
Remember all these Latin writers are also quoting from Duns Scotus Eriugena,
and all the other long list of writers named Scotus floating around the
Medieval texts, who all were of Irish Gaelic ancestry and must have been
obviously so to these Medieval writers, so its reasonable to suppose they
meant that here as well. As I think I pointed out, I am saying you cannot be
definitive in any deductions based on that word Scotus from 1303 in my
opinion, its just used too often to mean Irishman to assume it means Scottish
in that list or any where else for that date, we need to get other facts to
settle the question, in my opinion.  
  
Anyway hopefully I have started a modern debate on the subject!",1592
"Thanks for your comment, when I get a chance I will revise my post.",67
"I have two questions about participation: Some say that Scotus infamously
rejected the idea of participation in his metaphysics - though that is false -
and that participation has never been part of magisterial authority. So:  
  
1) Does this mean then that one can be a Scholastic without accepting
participation metaphysics of creation? And also, were there any Scholastics
who truly rejected participation but are orthodox?  
  
2) One potential objection to participation is that it seems to make creation
unoriginal, or devalues it by making it a copy of God's own nature, and that
rejecting participation resolves this tension - what do you think of this?  
  
Does participation make creation just a finite copy of God's own nature? Can
one still attribute originality and uniqueness to creatures even if one
accepts participation?  
  
What do you think of these?",872
"Right, Scotus did not reject participation. Rather, he is interested in
working out a coherent theory of science for theology and metaphysics, which
required attention to the order of concepts. Participation isn't much use for
that.  
  
1\. I don't see why not, though i don't know of anyone who did. Probably
ockham, but I don't know that for sure.  
  
2\. I think one could this off by reference to the divine ideas. As Scotus
defines an idea, it is the 'creatura intellecta', so it is not just a bad copy
of God, the divine idea of Socrates is Socrates 'qua understood.' Or you could
just reduce participation to the depedence of a creature on its cause. every
effect depends on a cause for its existence, the same is true for creatures.  ",744
"@Garrett,  
  
Could you elaborate a bit more about creatura intellecta and not being a copy?
I think it sounds interesting.  
  
  ",132
"@Garrett,  
  
Also, since effects pre-exist in their causes, and creation does have to
reflect God in a sense because otherwise we wouldn't be able to ascribe any
attributes (whether analogously or univocally) to God that we also find in
creatures, could one have a middle-position on this where creatures both
reflect God AND are also unique in themselves in the sense of not just being
copies or purely reflections of God?  
  
Maybe by appealing to the idea that God is Uniqueness itself and so by
reflecting God creatures also have their own intrinsic uniqueness as well? Or
by some other line of reasoning?  
  
Of course, one could say that created ideas are individually unique in
comparison to other created ideas, but aren't in comparison to God who is the
source of ideas. But I think one possible response to that would be that since
God is infinite and created ideas aren't fully similar to God, that even in
comparison to God created ideas likely have uniqueness.  
  
What do you think?  ",1003
"On the Thomistic view, as well as some independents after Aquinas, a divine
idea is just God knowing that the divine essence can be imitated in a certain
way. They are relations of imitability. Now Aquinas still claims God knows
creatures, has providence, etc., but the point is divine knowledge of
creatures happens by means of these imitatibility relations. Scotus claimed
the divine intellect generated various parts of essences and everything that
was not repugant could be joined, and among this latter class, the divine will
actualized some ideas to exist. He also says the divine ideas are primarily of
haecceities. On this view, the divine ideas would all be internal to the
divine intellect and will and not in the essence, so there would not be a
problem with divine simplicity. In other passages, however, he posits them in
the divine essence as representations that are formally distinct from each
other and from the divine essence.",944
"@Garrett, So it's perfectly compatible with Catholic theology to believe that
the divine ideas are outside the divine essence, and so have a certain
uniqueness to them making them not solely reflections of God?  
  
Is that correct?  
  ",237
"Well, it depends on what what you mean by 'outside'. They could be 'outside'
the formal notion of the divine essence, the divine essence as such, but
somehow contained in it. That would not be contrary to cahtolic theology,
which in any case has not ruled on the matter. If you put the ideas as
'outside' in the sense of plato's demiurge, probably that would not be
maintained. But yes, the divine ideas are supposed to be representations of
creatures, by which God creates creatures, so they cannot be purely
reflections of God. One possibly helkpful image is that of Peter THomae, who
says the divine essence is an intelligible mirror, out of which shine/are
reflected creatures. Bonaventure posits three ways creatures exist, in
themselves, in their universals, and in their ideas in God. So the content of
the divine ideas are definitely creatures.",852
"1) Well if they are outside the essence formally, they would only be contained
in the essence in the sense that the they aren't separable from God.  
  
Now you do say that the divine ideas of creatures can't be purely reflections
of God because they of creatures, and so their content is of creatures, but
couldn't one object by saying that though the ideas are about creatures, what
they ultimately are (their very content) just is finite reflections of God
since they are rooted in God, and each creature is just a different way of
reflecting God and nothing more?  
  
One can then imagine us seeing God in the New Creation, and so seeing all the
creatures in creation as just different reminders and reflections of God -
maybe like a young girl who's fallen in love with her boyfriend so much that
everything else has become just a different reminder of him. But this seems a
disappointing state of affairs, and so it seems fitting to say that the divine
ideas aren't just finite reflections of God, but have unique content in
themselves as well.  
  
  
2) Another way I saw of putting the idea of divine ideas being unique is from
Lossky, who complains in his Mystical Theology of the East that the West makes
creation just a poor copy of God and not unique because it includes the ideas
in the essence - in fact, I originally came across this whole issue of
uniqueness by reading him. He basically claims that they aren't the eternal
reasons of God contained within the very being of God or His essence - they
aren't just determinations of the essence to which creatures refer as to their
exemplary cause. So they aren't located in the essence, but are separated from
the essence and are instead in that which is after the essence - the will,
which determines the different modes of participating in God's creative
activity. Lossky then says that one of the supposed consequences of this would
be that the ideas are no longer necessary determinations of God's nature or
part of the intelligible content of the divine being.  
  
Now Lossky does tend to misunderstand Western theology, and his understanding
of divine simplicity may also be suspect insofar as it's neo-Palamite, but
could this sort of view Lossky describes become compatible with Catholic
theology?  
  
Another thing is the issue of exemplar causality, so I wonder how placing the
divine ideas formally outside the essence, and giving them uniqueness in the
sense that they aren't purely reflections of God due to their content being of
creatures, would work here.  
  
What do you think? This doesn't just apply to Lossky's view of uniqueness, but
also to what you described as well - would this eliminate all exemplary
causality for creatures? Or would we have a both/and situation where creatures
are both reflections of God but also unique in themselves - being both
exemplars and also unique things in their own right, so they aren't reducible
to the former?  ",2940

Duns Scotus is missing in the parish.  
May 29, 2021  
Scandal at my parish  
I affirm the Athanasius Creed (Whoever desires to be saved should above all
hold to the catholic faith.Anyone who does not keep it whole and unbroken will
doubtless perish eternally...)in the parish but the priests and many of the
parishioners do not do the same.  
I live in the parish, Santa Maria di Nazareth, Casalotti, Boccea.It is a
20-minute drive from Rome's Battistini Metro Station.How can they offer/attend
Holy Mass and not affirm the infallible teaching of the Athanasius Creed?  
I affirm Vatican Council II interpreted rationally in the parish but the
priests and most of the parishioners do not do so.  
For me LG 8, LG 14, LG 16, UR 3, NA 2, GS 22 etc are practical exceptions for
the Athanasius Creed. In other words, they refer to known non Catholics saved
outside the Church. They refer to physically visible people saved without
faith and the baptism of water.Invisible and unknown people cannot be
exceptions to the Creed. So with this irrationality they make the Athanasius
Creed obsolete.  
My interpretation of Vatican Council II is rational and traditional.It is not
a break with the Creeds.  
  
How can the priests and people offer/attend Holy Mass with an irrational
interpretation of Vatican Council II etc ?  
When the priests and people in the parish do not affirm the Athanasius Creed
and Vatican Council II, do they no have to go for the Sacrament of Confession,
end the scandal and correct themselves in public ?  
For me the baptism of desire(BOD) and being saved in invincible ignorance(I.I)
refer to hypothetical and theoretical cases only. I cannot meet or see someone
saved as such.It is only God who can know if someone is saved with BOD and
I.I. So there are no practical cases of BOD and I.I for me.There are also no
practical exceptions to the past Magisterial ecclesiocentrism of the Catholic
Church.  
But with visible for them,BOD and I.I, the priests and catechists and others
in the parish, reject the strict interpretation of the dogma extra ecclesiam
nulla salus(EENS).  
They change the interpretation of Vatican Council II.Since for them, LG 8, LG
14, LG 16, UR 3, etc contradict the dogma EENS. There are practical exceptions
for them.  
So they have rejected the dogma EENS and the Athanasius Creed which says
outside the Church there is no salvation.  
  
They have changed the meaning of the Nicene Creed. It is "" I believe in three
or more known baptisms for the forgiveness of sins and they exclude the
baptism of water in the Catholic Church( so EENS is rejected)"".  
They have changed the meaning of the Apostles Creed. It is "" I believe in the
Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church,'which teaches the Catholic Church today
that there is known salvation outside the Church and so the Creeds and
Catechisms are obsolete in their old understanding"".  
They have changed the meaning of the First Commandment which now indicates for
them that outside the Catholic Church there is known salvation and so there is
true worship in non Christian religions.  
This is public heresy, scandal and schism and Holy Mass is offered/ attended,
by all in the parish.  
This scandal has to be rectified in public, before absolution is given in the
Confessional.-lionel Andrades

"1.The first thing to note here is that Clarke reads Scotus and Ockham (though
he does not distinguish between them) though the lens of Thomism, specifically
the real distinction of essence and existence. Hence the label ""essentialist"",
inherited from Gilson. The claim here is that Scotus and Ockham ignore
existence and are talking about being as a purely non-existential essence.
Wolter, way back in his transcendentals book, commented on this claim of
Gilson to the effect that it was an ingenious account of what Scotus would
have said if he were a Thomist. But of course, Scotus is not a Thomist. Scotus
denies the real distinction of essence and existence.",662
"2\. Clarke does grasp that part of the concern of univocity is to have valid
syllogisms. He, Clarke, seems to think that being does not have a distinct
concept, however, given that he thinks Scotus was also motivated by discomfort
with vague ideas. This is a matter of debate among Thomists themselves,
historically and today. Some agree with Scotus that there is a distinct
concept of being that includes nothing else, some, like Clarke, think you
can't separate the concept of being from the concept of God or of something in
the categories. One then has to ""stretch"" created being to get a notion of the
divine. Scotus, as we know, did think being had a distinct concept.",674
"3\. The heavy price of univocity. Here I think Clarke's explanation goes awry.
He claims that Scotus and Ockham make the concept of being abstract and empty,
just a linguistic marker, but also that it stands for God and creatures. Of
course, the concept of being, as such, does not stand for God and creatures.
As it is included in the concept of God and the concept of a creature it is
univocal, but of itself the concept of being is neither the concept of God nor
the concept of a creature. Clarke does not give a reference to the remark of
Ockham's that he claims is explicit, to wit, that there is nothing common to
God and creatures. This seems to clinch matters for Clarke, we arrive at
basically a contradiction, being is univocal, but there is nothing common
(which equals univocal, anyway). This appears to be a garbled awareness on the
part of Clarke to the problem of the reality of the concept of being. This is
the problem that the concept of being, qua abstract and univocal, signifies no
corresponding reality outside the mind. This runs against the common notion
from the Aristotelian commentary tradition that concepts map directly onto
things. Normally, Scotus would agree; but to get to concepts of the
transcendentals, you have to abstract from the concept you have derived from
the actually existing thing. That abstraction does not correspond to the
reality outside the soul. And note, this is a different sense of the word
'abstraction' than you get in Aquinas or even when you are talking about the
three acts of the Aristotelian intellect. There is abstraction from the
phantasm, that gets you the concept of a nature, say catness. To get being,
you abstract from this nature, present in the intellect as an intelligible
species, by stripping off the modes of finitude and so on. So in the end,
considering God and creatures as they exist outside the soul, there is nothing
in common. But one can abstract from the concept of a creature to the concept
of being, which can also be applied to God.",2020
"4\. The alleged result is to make God more remote and unknowable. But since we
have now seen that Scotus does not hold that the concept of being is both pure
and contains the concept of God and creatures, the result doesn't follow
either. Scotus himself, interestingly, defends the univocity of being not in
metaphysics, but in the context of describing the natural knowledge of God.
Not only being is univocal, but all the transcendentals, general divine
attributes, are as well. So a lot more is known, both by an intellect trying
to have a general cognition of the divine nature, as well as scientifically by
means of forming valid demonstrations. Indeed, it has always seemed to me that
Scotus is the affirmative theologian par excellence, who ought rather than
Aquinas to be paired with Dante. But that can wait for another day.",833
"5\. Repurcussions. The alleged effect of rendering God more remote has
repurcussions many later areas of life. The usual Thomist claim from the 20th
century, disagreement with our man leads to societal decay. I've always been
rather struck that the ones who trumpet this the loudest, the RO crowd, are by
practice theologians who supposedly believe in sin, or at least weakness of
will. sin seems to me to be a far better explanation than that of univocity
for the apparently inevitable march from Scotus to whatever modern thing you
don't like. If I were to have lived during the reformation period and watched
christians killing each other over the proper definition of the eucharist I
would probably try to set up a non christian secular state of skepticism as
well. To be fair to Clarke, this is not the focus of the discussion, just a
throwaway line at the end.",866
"Aren't most, if not all, contemporary Thomistic engagements with Scotist
univocity basically throwaway lines?",109
"Pretty much. They use the Thomist textbooks, not primary sources. The general
attitude is that they are engaging with modern thought rather than that
backward medieval stuff. It's hard to show how relevant you are to analytic or
continental philosophy if there are major medieval objections to your
position.  
  ",313
"How does that make it difficult, major medieval objections? The big assumption
is that they don't matter after Aquinas -- except as a kind of useful foil if
it is Ockham.",170
"  
This time, univocity separates us completely from God. But often, univocity
makes God just another being and destroys proper reverence. Oh, well-  
  
You characterize Duns Scotus (and Ockham) as describing:  
  
being as a purely non-existential essence  
  
Don't all agree that being is not an essence? I assume this was a casual word
choice  
on your part.  
It seems that rejection of being as a concept leads one to the notion of being
as an absolute, blinding intuition. If God is pure,unbounded being, I'm not
sure how one, i.e., Clarke, could separate God from being.  
  
I also think of Gilson when trying to understand Clarke; of Gilson and the
mystical confusion of twentieth century Neoplatonist Thomism a.k.a. ""esse.""",735
"Matthew, given that there are major objections to basically every Thomistic
doctrine I would say it is a problem. To deal with them you would have to
engage medieval thought a lot more, and do more advanced scholastic
metaphysics. As it is, a lot of the thomist-modernist material tends to be
exposition for moderns. like the Clarke book, really. To get rid of the
medieval objections you just recapitulate Aquinas, then move on to
phenomenology.  
  
James, I have been meaning to write something on the God as being problem for
a while, ever since Al Kimel and the Maverick philosopoher were debating over
it. Maybe I will yet.  
  
on essence/existence there was a wide variety of positions. Even if one thinks
that Scotus posits a formal distinction there, formal distinctions are
generally thought to obtain between inseparables. And there was also a
movement assigning being an essence, talking about the quiddity of being. You
get this in non Scotist independents like Marchia, and several Scotists will
talk about the quiddity of being (John of Reading, Bonetus, probably
Mayronis), whereas some are more circumspect, such as Petrus Thomae, who calls
being 'essentiative' without it being an essence, and Scotus himself, who
calls it quidditative without being a quid.",1276
"  
Yes, I am wrestling with the complexities of Duns Scotus' understanding of
existence/essence in Lazella's book, ""The Singular Voice of Being,"" in which
he makes full use of the last two distinctions you note. Too important (and
dense) a exposition to read only once. Or twice. The Quidditative seem to
exist ""formally"" in a way ontologically prior to their relationship to God or
being. But I don't understand yet in what sense this term is meant. Logically?
Platonically? Doubt it. In a sense of pure possibility? This would tempt an
""activation"" sort of notion for Creation, in which certain possibles are
chosen for being. Divine ideas seem to function in this way for Aquinas, in
the sense that all possible beings (or at least the ones that will be
realized)have rationes in the mind of God. The effort to think through all the
possibilities in this general vein has long seemed an important goal for a
scholar, and an indispensable goal for a teacher.",960
"James, why do you think it an indispensable goal for a teacher?",63
"So it depends... being is quidditative without being a common nature. But for
the common natures, the divine intellect generates lots of formal parts that
can then be combined in various ways... animality and rationality, etc. The
divine will then chooses among these essences in the divine intellect and
actualizes some of them. In some other passages, however, it sounds rather
that all individuals are contained in the divine essence, which is able to
represent them to the divine intellect which then hands them to the divine
will for actualization.  
  
But for being, it doesn't exist anywhere as such; that is an abstraction from
an actually existing thing, such as God or a creature. Being isn't prior then
to God, even logically, even though one can abstract off the intrinsic mode of
infinity and conceive being as such.",830
"But the notion of being as quidditative but not a quiddity is bit hard to
grasp. And this was the occasion of a split among the most creative scotists.
Mayronis and Bonetus hold being is a quiddity, and Bonetus goes on to write a
metaphysics centered on that notion, in which he argues that being is univocal
over being in the mind and being in the world. Peter Thomae rejects this
bonetan position, in part I think because he does not hold being to be a
quiddity.",464
"  
Matthew asks:  
James, why do you think it an indispensable goal for a teacher?  
  
where by ""it"" we mean, ""The effort to think through all the possibilities in
this general vein.""  
  
I cast the answer in a personal vein. In studying metaphysics, I found it very
difficult to construct a ""grammar"" of the subject, that is, a systematic
explanation of which claims and questions that can be constructed with the
terms peculiar to scholastic metaphysics. What questions using these words
make sense? AN Whitehead develops a metaphysical language in Process and
Reality, the very language in which the book is written. He teaches you to
speak ""process"" by beginning with basic or elementary claims and working
systematically. The aufbau, or building-up, is discursive in nature; it does
not make the ""essentialist"" error of using Euclid's geometry as a
paradigm.Perhaps the aufbau of Scholastic metaphysics needs to utilize
questions, not statements; beginning with basic questions and exploring the
various possibilities of constructive or fruitful ways to answer them. There
are books on scholastic metaphysics that do proceed in this manner, but they
construct only limited aspects of a full metaphysics.  
  
These are merely the reflections of a theoretical physicist, one very
conversant with formal languages for technical description, who began his
study of scholastic metaphysics at the age of 40, after years of studying and
teaching formal descriptive languages in the hard sciences.",1497

"I have been working through Hegel's science of logic of late, and in the

"""The system of logic is the realm of shadows, the world of simple
essentilialities, freed of all sensuous concretion. To study this science, to
dwell and to labor in this realm of shadows, is the absolute culture and
discipline of consciousness. Its task is one which is remote from the
intuititions and the goals of the senses, remote from feelings and from the
world of merely fancied representation.""",403
"Not immediately pertinent -- but it's Hegel, so maybe anything can be made
pertinent -- I had a Scotist prof who told of a scholar he knew who, all his
life, wrote against Scotus. But then, that scholar started
comparing/contrasting Hegel and Aquinas and got spooked: Aquinas, he
found/thought he found, led to Hegel. So what did that Scholar do? He
converted to Scotism on his deathbed. (No, I don't know who the scholar is; I
should have asked.)",447
"Well, it is an interesting story. It does illustrate the dangers of the 'led
to' approach to philosophy. I don't think Aquinas would grant a pure concept
of being, for example, unlike Hegel and Scotus, though this is famously
debated in later Thomism.",251
"Could you elaborate on how that illustrates the dangers of the 'led to'
approach to philosophy?  
  
Wait, what do you mean you think he (Thomas) wouldn't grant a pure concept of
being? I guess I don't know what else a concept of being could be...",247
"because it is still the villain approach to philosophy, not a philosophical
approach. He abandons Aquinas because he thinks Aquinas makes certain claims
that could be developed logically in a certain way, that 'lead to' Hegel's
position, that he already thinks is bad. So he drops Aquinas because Aquinas
is aligned with Hegel and adopts Scotus. Maybe I am reading into your
description, but that is what the 'leads to' is, basically, narrative.  
  
I am not sure what Aquinas thinks. i don't think i have seen him talk about
'pure being' save in De veritate. Thomists normally won't grant that there is
a concept of being distinct from the concept of God or distinct from the
concept of created being. I think maybe Suarez does, and Cajetan maybe, I
can't remember. But contemporary Thomists won't admit this. Henry of Ghent
goes this route too, there is just the two kinds of being, no third kind
possible, save by error of the intellect.",941
"To the first, aha, ok, yes, that is what happened.  
  
To the second, I can't remember Aquinas speaking of pure being, either. It
doesn't sound like something he'd say. It just seems to me weird to talk of a
""non-pure"" concept of being, but I guess that's right, insofar as , for
Aquinas, the concept of being is either abstracted from/regards primarily
created beings. (If you go the route of the-first-principles-are-infused,
then, I guess, things could get interesting.)",474
"Yes, Suárez thinks that the conceptus entis objectivus is most simple and
prescinds from the considerations of divine and created being (Disp. Metaph.
2.2.8). In this consideration he would be followed by a number of Jesuit
scholastics (e.g., Hurtado de Mendoza and Rodrigo de Arriaga). Interestingly,
unlike Scotus, Suárez thinks that the simple objective concept of being
remains analogical. Hurtado thinks the same but for different reasons, but
Arriaga returns to the path of univocity. It's interesting how the unity of
being begets such a diversity of opinion!  
Best,  
Victor",583
"Victor, I haven't read Suarez on that, but it sounds reasonable. Weird that he
still thinks the Co[O]B (concept of [objective] being] is analogical. Why does
he think so?  
  
But yes, the plurality of opinions within the unity of being probably should
suggest something to us, although I don't know what that something is.",323
"Matthew, Suarez thinks the concept of being is analogical because it does not
descend to its inferiora (i.e., God-creature, substance-accidents)
indifferently (as would be required for univocity according to his thinking)
but ""of itself"" descends according to priority and posteriority (i.e., first
to God, then creatures; first to substance, then accidents). Much of his
thinking has to do with his understanding of the immanent transcendence of
being wherein being is contained in all of its differences, modes, and
attributes. As such, his conception of being differs from Scotus's conception
wherein being is not predicated 'in quid' of its differences, modes,
attributes, but only 'in quale.' As such, the concept of being is, for Scotus,
simpliciter simplex and easily understood to be univocal. In short, Suarez's
transcendental theory, which is divergent from that of Scotus, also leads to a
different conclusion regarding analogy-univocity.

Excuse me for this off-topic but could you tell me about Duns Scotus' position
on the issue of eternal damnation? It seems to me that the philosophical
argument of Apocatastasis is that Evil cannot have the power of Being, so it
is inconceivable that a soul burns for eternity in hell  
  
I have another question: conservative Catholics regularly accuse medieval
nominalism of having precipitated the royal State (notably through the jurists
of Philip IV of France influenced by Roman law and Code of Justinian) into
liberal modernity, the transgender ideology etc ... Do you think it's the same
kind of grotesque anachronism as the ones about Duns Scotus? Is it relevant to
link contemporary relativism to the relationship maintained by William of
Ockham with universals?  
  
Thank you again",915
"Well, on damnation: i think all the high medieval latin thinkers would defend
the eternity of hell. On the grounds that it is a matter of rectitude in the
will, and the will chan't change after death. Scotus in particular, despite
positing 'voluntarism' doesn't seem to have such a high view for even the
blessed to avoid sin, and says that God actively blocks their wills from
willing evil in the beatific vision (!). So I doubt he would be sympathetic to
D.B. Hart's views, or whatever some of the early fathers may have thought.  
  
As for 2, I think it is hogwash. I really don't believe that the metaphysics
influence politics in the way these people think. nominalism predates Aquinas,
Scotus, and Ockham. They also like to equivocate on 'indivdualism' and claim
that the emphasis on cognition of singulars leads to modern consumer
culture... again I find it unbelievable. This is just one attempt to make
thomism relevant again. You posit a disease that has corrupted all of society,
a disease caused by not following your favorite thinker. then it is easy to
see that the answer to all our problems is ITe ad Thomam, and there is then an
excuse for ideological hiring in the universities and seminaries, as well as
ideological scholasrship. Rhetorically it is hard to defend against, since
explaining how scotus and ockham are being misinterpreted by your garden
variety apologist is way too complicated. So the scotus and ockham people

"One of the few things on which the analysts, pragmatists, and existentialists
agree with the dialectical theologians is that Hegel is to be repudiated:
their attitude toward Kant, Aristotle, Plato, and the other great philosophers
is not at all unanimous even within each movement; but opposition to Hegel is
part of the platform of all four, and of the Marxists, too. Oddly, the man
whom all these movements take to be so crucially important is but little known
to most of their adherents; very few indeed have read as many as two of the
four books that Hegel published.",571
"Hegel is known largely through secondary sources and a few incriminating
slogans and generalizations. The resulting myth, however, lacked a
comprehensive, documented statement till Karl Popper found a place for it in
his widely discussed book, The Open Society and Its Enemies. After it had gone
through three impressions in England, a revised one-volume edition was brought
out in the United States in 1950, five years after its original appearance.  
  
[...]  
  
Furthermore, Popper has relied largely on Scribner’s _Hegel Selections_ , a
little anthology for students that contains not a single complete work. Like
Gilson in _The Unity of Philosophical Experience_ (p. 246), Popper takes over
such a gross mistranslation as “the State is the march of God through the
world,” although the original says merely that it is the way of God with the
world that there should be the State, and even this sentence is lacking in the
text published by Hegel and comes from one of the editor’s additions to the
posthumous edition of The _Philosophy of Right_ — and the editor admitted in
his Preface that, though these additions were based on lecture notes, “the
choice of words” was sometimes his rather than Hegel’s.

No conception is bandied about more unscrupulously in the history of ideas
than “Influence.” Popper’s notion of it is so utterly unscientific that one
should never guess that he has done important work on logic and on scientific
method. At best, it is reducible to post hoc, ergo propter hoc. Thus he speaks
of “the Hegelian Bergson” (p. 256 and n. 66) and assumes, without giving any
evidence whatever, that Bergson, Smuts, Alexander, and Whitehead were all
interested in Hegel, simply because they were “evolutionists” (p. 225 and n.
6).",1767
"Glad to know your blog is up and running again!  
  
The habit of commentators on Hegel placing Hegel's work in a myth of *the*
history of philosophy (or March of Mind, as it were) is ironically and
explicitly one he encourages and builds himself. We should probably thank him
for it; his History of Philosophy (rather than his Philosophy of History)
seemed to be very influential for incepting in 19c German universities studies
in the history of philosophy. Of course, as with Scotus, practical philosophy
for Hegel did not mean the humdrum encouragement of political or practical
movements; as - as is well known - Popper, Russel, and the Marxists want
'Hegel -> Fascism'; or Radical Orthodoxy's 'Scotus -> all modern ailments'.
And at any rate, modern Hegel scholars are of so different stripes: some
attempting to stick primarily to source material and in effect do Hegel
exegesis; others - usually postmodern - taking the Kool Aid and viewing him as
progressive step to XYZ phenomenon/thinker/ideology/goodness-knows-what. This
is a problem known to the British Idealists, some of whom do engage with Hegel
as an exegete, e.g. JME McTaggart - see his Commentary on Hegel's Logic-, seem
to want *only* to think through Hegel by his own steps.  
But I'm not sure there are comparable medieval thinkers to Hegel, because I'm
not sure any medieval thinker (and I would be very interested to know) thinks
about the philosophy of history in terms of teleological fulfilment, or were
interested particularly in what is of distinctly *historical* concern. (I
would be very interested to know if there are Western medieval reflections on
the philosophy of history?).

"Hi PJ, so all i meant was that extreme distortions of an author's work is not
limited to Scotus and his enemies. So a very tenuous, non doctrinal connection
between Scotus and Hegel is what I was alluding to. I have been reading the
science of logic, that is all, but I would agree, the medievals don't discuss
philosophy of history. for them, at least the Latins, such things would be
subsumed into the beatific vision and the final end of humanity. There are
some loose parallels between Hegel's reflections on the notion of being and
Peter Thomae's De ente, but that is not due to any historical connection or
theorizing, just the internal logic of the problem of being, I would say.",686

a result of God's love for His creation and would have happened whether or not
man sinned, but because man sinned, Christ suffered the cross as an act of
love to bring about our redemption. Christ's desire that the cup pass shows
that it was not something He sought and would have liked for the Father to
take the cup away. No such regret seems to come in reference to His
Incarnation.",696

"Well, how ""Thomist"" Pierre Roger is, is open to debate. The ""Pax"" referred to
by Meyronnes is a little tricky, since we don't know what exactly it's about.
In spite of such clowns (as myself) talking about the Meyronnes and the first
mention of the ""schola minorum"", it should be noted that Meyronnes only uses
the term (that I've found) in his writings as a bachelor; the importance of
this point is that a regent master is in charge of his own school, so
Meyronnes-the-master might have a different attitude towards schools.  
And before Meyronnes, the Dominican Matteo Orsini openly mocked Hugh of
Novocastro's defense of _formalitates_ \- if, that is, you believe the word of
Meyronnes' secretary, and if that's what he really was.

He gives a single reference to Scotus, shockingly a quote, though he doesn't
cite an edition or translator:  
  ",115
"> Duns Scotus, _Opus oxoniense_ , I, 3, 1: ""I say, then, first, that not only
> can a concept naturally be had in which God is conceived as it were
> accidentally, for instance, with regard to some attribute, but also a
> certain concept in which God is conceived by himself and quidditatively"".",295
"  
**Comment:** as is usual with modern philosophers who are non specialists, it
is univocity that ruined good traditional philosophy. For these people, it is
more important that philosophy be a tradition than that it be an activity in
any way related to arguments. Scotus' arguments are not quoted nor shown to be
false, it is just taken to be obvious since the author disagrees with the
conclusions of Scotus' arguments. The quote also has some ambiguities.
""reality"" is not defined. If by ""reality"" you mean creation, then Scotus would
deny that God is part of reality or within the horizon of reality if you
prefer to talk in that fashion. But if by ""reality"" you mean the totality of
existing things, then Scotus would agree, even if he would qualify it and say
that God and creatures agree in no reality.  
  
Perl does not provide exegesis of the quote. It is clear that he interprets it
as implying that since we can grasp God by a concept that we totally and
completely grasp God in a concept, and that there can thus be no divine
transcendence. But Scotus would deny this as well, saying instead that even if
we grasp God quidditatively we do not have full comprehension of the divine
essence, which, since it is infinite, always exceeds our finite minds. Also,
the concept that we form of God, infinite being, only imperfectly represents
the divine reality, since 'infinite being' is a complex concept and God is
simple. This too does not warrant a mention.  
  
Perl's central thesis is that thought and being are parallel, and Scotus, or
at least Ockham are a threat to this. Univocity might seem a threat to this,
since, in Richard Cross' words, the concept of being is a ""vicious
abstraction"", ie. it does not correspond to any extra mental reality. But the
concept of being is the result of an operation (abstraction) performed on the
complex concept of a creature, which itself is based on an extramental thing.
So Scotus also believes in the parallel of thought and being, but this doesn't
mean that we can't perform mental operations the products of which might not
themselves be directly parallel. At least, perl would need another argument to
show this. Maybe he has one and I will find it as I read his book. We will
see.  
  
I am always somewhat bemused by the intense hatred of Scotus by modern
neoplatonists, especially in theology. naturally, it is univocity they focus
on, which is opposed to the de facto hero of theology, Thomas aquinas. But for
centuries Scotus has himself been seen as part of the neoplatonist movement,
given the extreme platonism of his doctrine of the Ideas. Renaissance
platonists, such as Ficino, numbered him among their own school. But all such
niceties have been forgotten these days.  
  
Here's a quote from a different book that caught my eye, and though it is
implicitly directed against Scotus, it seems to implicitly embrace univocity
of being.

Translation:  
  
""Contra: it is certain"" [this is a lemma from Scotus' _Ord_.] for this
argument note that the first question of the prologue of the Conflatus of
Francis of Meyronnes is maximally valid for refuting this opinion of Henry,
because in that it is proved in many ways and demonstrated that the first
principle holds in theology, and so also it can be formed in God just as in
creatures and so applied to spiritual and insensible just as to corporeal and
sensible or material [matters]. I do not adduce anything from that question
[of Francis], because it is found everywhere and Scotus holds the same way
here, arguing against Henry. Also for this is Aristotle in many places, who
intended that the first principle be applied to substances and non sensibiles
just as to sensibiles, for in the books of the _Metaphysics_ he treats
principally of substances and non sensibles, as is clear in many places, most
of all in [books] II, XI, and XII, and in the fourth book he treats throughout
about the first complex principle where he posits those properties which
Francis posits above in the beginning of the question [i.e. _Conflatus_ prol.
q. 1]. And indeed it would be marvellous that in those aforesaid books he
would have said to much about the first complex principle if he had intened
that that be excluded from insensible things and separated from matter about
which he treats there, and principally about them he treated and ordered the
books of the _Metaphysics_ principally on account of them.  
  
And returning to the letter of the Doctor and proving his antecedent, it is
clear that well indeed it can be known by our intellect that it is impossible
that one angle at once is and is not, or by descending to more special terms
that the same angel is material and not material or sensible and non sensible,
just as the same stone at once is and is not, or at once is rough and not
rough, and thus for others, and so can the first principle be applied to
insensibles just as to sensibles, therefore that response [of Henry's] is
vain.",2058

Aquinas had a sense of analogy, he didn't write about the 'analogy of being.'
Well, okay, maybe the phrase doesn't show up in Thomas's work, but I have
found both 'analogia entis' and 'analogia essendi' in Albertus Magnus's
Commentary on the Divine Names. In fact, Thomas Aquinas took the dictation of
that text, so he would have very definitely been aware of the phrase in the
thick sense, as you put it. Certainly, the idea has a provenance well before
Suarez (whom many often enough accuse of univocity) even within his own Jesuit

the Metaphysics and Antonio Rubio wrote an entire tract on analogy.

the _divisio textus_ of the Pseudo-D., and the usage doesn't support much. I
can't find _analogia entis_ , but it's a big text. Certainly, he speaks of the
_proportio analogiae_ between creator and creatures, but I can't find the
exact phrase.  
  
About Aquinas taking dictation of the text: out of curiosity, do you have
literature on this? The introduction to the edition supposes that N was copied
by Aquinas either from his own notes or from those of Albert.
Palaeographically, a script made from dictation looks very different from one
made by direct copying, even for a cacograph like Thomas.

Si igitur in analogia entis hoc primum est substantia, oportet primum
Philosophum, qui de ente intendit habere scientiam substantiarum : et quia
scientia non habetur nisi per causas et principia, oportet Philosophum habere
causas et principia substantiarum. Adhuc quoniam omne analogum est in
communitate quadam cujusdam generalitatis et ambitus multorum, et omnis
generis unius est unus sensus et una scientia, sicut grammatica quae
orthographia dicitur, una existens scientia omnes speculatur litteratas voces,
ideo etiam unius et ejusdem scientiae est speculari entis in quantum est ens
omnes species quascumque species habet ens, et species specierum, sive sint
separata, ut Platoni placuit, sive sint in re, sive in anima, secundum quod ad
ens referuntur. Sic enim unum genus vocamus, quod est unum et primum
subjectum, ad quod alia quocumque modo omnia referuntur. Palam igitur est de
ente omni esse scientiam unam ut de subjecto, quod multa habet essentialia
praedicata, quae sequuntur ens in quantum est ens, sicut potentiam et actum,
et idem et diversum, et hujusmodi : et haec eadem est de speciebus entis
omnibus et specierum speciebus, secundum quod ad ens primum sicut ad unum

"Thanks, Lee, for posting this. I'll have my library order it. I'm particularly
interested in your article about the origin of supertranscendentals. I've been
following my doktovater, John Doyle, on this subject and looking into the
progression super transcendental doctrines makes in Jesuit scholasticism. The
obvious authors are Fonseca and (among Dominicans) Soto who call attention to
the doctrine but do not give names of authors who support it. Claus Andersen
pointed out to me that the earliest reference to ""supertranscendentals"" he has
found is in Pere Dagui's treatise on differences. Does Scotus himself use the
term ""supertranscendental""?  
Best,  
Victor",666
"Hi Victor,  
  
I did just see the announcement of your article on the subject; perhaps we
should trade via email? anyway, I am not sure of the earliest use of the term.
It is not in Scotus. My interest was in the claim whether being is univocal
with respect to esse reale and esse rationis. There has been some debate
whether Bonetus is a supertranscendentalist, since he answers in the
affirmative. I basically argue that Scotus proposes a 'via' that seems to
endorse the claim, a via whose ultimate status is unclear, but that this had
little immediate impact before the 15th c. Bonetus never alludes to it. One
can find some discussion of the esse reale/ens reale problem in early scotist
authors, but they are not interested in supertranscendentals as such, only in
delineating the scope of univocity. So, I basically think there is no
connection between scotus and scotism and the supertranscendentalist talk.
Scotists tend all to deny it.  
  
But that being said, one can find various authors affirming a univocity of
real being and being of reason soon after Scotus, such as Harclay (1313), and
Hervaeus attributes it to Scotus in his second Quodlibet, which was then
picked up by Auriol, and Auriol made his way into capreolus, so Scotus has
been associated with the claim for a long time. There is also an anonymous
text that might be Wylton holding the claim, and its probably in marchia as
well. But none of these people use the term supertranscendental. Anyway,
that's basically what the article is about: the non influence of Scotus.",1548
"Sure, I can be reached at salas[dot]victor[at]shms[dot]edu. Scotus's account
of the relationship between univocity and the esse reale/ens rationis
distinction remains a fascinating area regarding supertranscendentality. I
think there was an essay not too long ago in the ACPQ (by a Dominican if I
remember correctly) who addresses the second Quodlibet issue. In late Jesuit
scholasticism it seems that the relationship between ens reale and ens
rationis is one of gradual convergence. First, they are held in definite
opposition (Suarez), then both are included in metaphysics (Hurtado and
Arriaga), then both are located under an analogical concept (Lynch) and
eventually under a univocal concept. It's a fascinating trajectory.

##  [Quaestio 3: Whether the concept of being is maximally first],65
"And it seems that the concept of being is not maximally first, ecause
according to Porphyry, the ten categories are the ten first genera of things;
therefore the concepts of the ten categories are maximally first; therefore
the concept of being is not maximally first.",268
"Furthermore, if the concept of being is maximally first, therefore the most
general is not the most general. The consequent is false, therefore also the
antecedent. Proof the consquence, because the most general is called that
which does not have a supervening or superior genus according to Porphyry; but
if the concept of being were maximally first, something would be superior to
the most general; therefore, etc.",416
"Furthermore, in I _Posterior Analytics_ chapter on the position[status] of the
categories it was proved that the resolution of all quidditative concepts
stops at the highest point at the concepts of the ten categories; but
resolution does not stop unless at the maximally first; therefore the concepts
of the ten categories are maximally first.",344
"Furthermore, in VII _Metaphysics_ chapter 1 it is said thus: “something is
said to be first in many ways, but substance is first of all with respecto
reason [ratio], knowledge and time; therefore the concept of substance is
maximally first.",240
"This is confirmed, first by this which is said in the same place “first being
and not some being,” that is not through some being, “but being indeed will be
unqualifiedly [simpliciter] substance.” Second because in I _De generatione_
chapter 7 it is said that being “unqualifiedly singifies the first according
to each category,” that is, substance.",349
"Contra: being is impressed [on the intellect] by a first impression, from
[the] first [book] of Avicenna’s _Metaphysics_ chapter 5, therefore the
concept of being is unqualifiedly first.",186
"I respond: in that question I will first declare three conclusions, second I
will exclude certain objections.",109
"Concerning the first [article], I show first that the quidditative concept of
being is most common, second that only the concept of being is the most common
among quidditative concepts, third that only the concept of being is maximally
first.",242
"I show the first conclusion thus: that concept is most common whose extent
[ambitus] nothing positive can escape; but nothing positive can escape the
concept of being; therefore the concept of being is most common. And briefly,
all philosophers and doctors agree in this conclusion.",282
"{Whence Richard the Englisman [argues thus]: just as the first complex concept
is founded in being by comparing it to its contradictory, namely, of every
being or non-being, so it is necessary that the first incomplex concept be
said of all most commonly, for a concept whic is includited in every concept
and none of those [is included] in it is maximally first; but the quidditative
concept of being according as it is being is of this kind; therefore etc.",458
"Alexander [de Alessandria] in I _sentences_ proves it to be thus: “that which
contains infinite being by its primary division seems to be the widest
concept.[[1]](file:///C:/Users/Anik/Desktop/Current/Analogy%20and%20Univocity/Projects/Petrus%20Thomae%20De%20ente%20Further%20Research/Petrus%20Thomae%20De%20ente%20Translation/PT_Being_Translation.docx#_ftn1)}",360
"[Conclusion 2: the concept of being alone is the most common quidditative
concept]",82
"I deduce the second conclusion thus: there is no special being which is
predicated of everything (this is clear); but being is predicated of
everything; therefore only the concept of being is the most common.",208
"And this is to argue thus: the highest community cannot befall a concept
determined to a certain genus or to a special mode of being; but ever concept
other than the concept of being is of this kind; therefore the highest
community is able to befall non other concept than the concept of being.",294
"I deduce the third conclusion thus: a grade of primacy in concepts is attained
according to a grade of communit; but only the concept of being has the
highest grade of community, from the preceding; therefore among all concepts
only the concept of being has the highest grade of primacy, and consequently
is maximally first. The major is clear from that common [vulgata] proposition
‘how much more common, so much prior’.",421
"Furthermore, ‘it is impossible for the same at the same time to be and not to
be’ is unqualifiedl first in complex [concepts], as all say, therefore the
proper concept of being is unqualifiedly first in incomplex [concepts]. The
consequence is clear, because the order of complex concepts est according to
the order of incomplex concepts, whence just as complex concepts depend on
incomplex [concepts] for truth and knowability, so they depend for communit
and primacy.",469
"Furthermore, a concept to which only the first negation is opposed is alone
unqualifeidly maximally first; but the first negation is opposed in the first
place only to the concept fo being; therefore only the concept of being is
unqualifiedly maximally first. The major is clear, because the order of
negations is according to the order of affirmations. The minor is clear,
because the first negation is non-being [non-esse], and that is opposed in the
first place only to being [esse].",486
"Furthermore, what “is said through superabundance befalls only one alone”
according to the Philosoher in the book of the _Topics_ , therefore in
incomplex concepts the highest primacy befalls one alone; but this cannot
befall any other concept than the concept of bieng, to which befalls the
highest community; therefore the highest primacy befalls only the concept of
being.",375
"Furthermore, a concept that is ultimate by the ultimate ultimacy and first by
the first primacy is unqualifiedly first; but the concept of being is of this
kind; therefore only the concpet of being is unqualifiedly first. The major is
clear, for, as it was said in the second question of the prologue of the
_Sentences_
,[[2]](file:///C:/Users/Anik/Desktop/Current/Analogy%20and%20Univocity/Projects/Petrus%20Thomae%20De%20ente%20Further%20Research/Petrus%20Thomae%20De%20ente%20Translation/PT_Being_Translation.docx#_ftn2)
there are grades in primacies and ultimacies, so that the ultimate in
resolving and the first in composing est unqualifiedly first. The minor is
clear, because the concept of being is most common.",720
"Concerning the second [article,] it can be objected against the aforesaid.
First, thus: that in which something agree is more commmen than them; but the
concept of being and the the quidditative special concepts agree in a
quidditative concept; therefore a quidditative concept is more common than the
concept of being and the other special concepts. The minor is clear, because
the concept of being is quidditative and the other special concepts are
quidditative.",464
"Furthermore, second thus: just as being is formally distinguished from non-
being, so non-being from being; therefore a formality is common to being and
to non-being, and consequently it is more common than being.",213
"Futhermore, third thus: when something befalls many, it is necessary that
something common is found in them; but to be predicated befalls being and non-
being; therefore the concept of a name is more common than the concept of
being. The minor is clear because a negation is non-being and a privation is
non-being and nothing is non-being. The major is clear from [book] I of the
_Posterior Analytics_.",402
"Furthermore, fourth thus: to be signified by a name is common to being and
non-being; but the concept of being is not common to non-being; therefore the
concept of a name is more common than the concept of being.",212
"Furthermore, fifth thus: what are of equal extent [ambitus] are of equal
community; but the one, the true and the good are of equal extent with being,
for they are convertible with it; theerefore they are of equal community, and
consequently non solum conceptus entis est communissimus.",286
"As evidence of the foregoing I say first that community in concepts can be
understood in four ways: first in the order of the categories, secund in the
order of the concepts of real beings, third in the order of
howsoever[qualitercumque] beings, fourth in the order of the transcendentals.
In teh first order the concepts of the most general are the most common and
unqualifiedly first, in the second the transcendental concepts common to God
and creatures, and substance and accident, in teh third the concept of being
common to real being and being of reason, or to being in the soul and to being
outside the soul, which is the same, and this community is treated in VI
_Metaphysics_ , in the fourth [order] the proper concept of being which indeed
is common to the one the true and the good and the other proper passions [of
being], not by a community of formal predication, but of denominative
predication and virtual containment, as has to be explained below. From the
forgoing it is clear that simply speaking only the proper concept of being is
most common and maximally first.",1084
"To the first [objection]: against this should be said that perhaps [the term]
‘concept’, as some say, is not a name of first intention. It is not, however,
unsuitable for many second intentions to agree in something of this kind, just
as noting of first intention is common to the categories according to some and
nevertheless they [i.e. the categories] agree in this intention which is
‘category’, and the ten most general [categories] in the intention which is
‘most general’ and the same, it seems, can be said about [the term]
‘quidditative’.",546
"To the second [objection]: it is clear through the same, for ‘formality’ as
some say, seems to be a second intention.",117
"Against this: a second intention is founded in a first [intention] and
consequently presupposes it; but non-being is not a first intention; therefore
a second intention cannot be founded in non-being, and consequently neither
‘formality’.",238
"It is confirmed, because what is founded in nothing is nothing; but the
formality of non-being, if it is posted, is founded in nothing; therefore the
formality of non-being is nothing. The major is evident. The minor is clear,
because either something positive is subject to it or nothing. If nothing, I
have what is proposed. If something positive, therefore it is not non-being
which is posited non-being.",407
"Therefore I say otherwise that just as no intelligibility per se befalls non-
being or nothing, so no formality befalls it per se.",130
"To the form [of the objection]: I deny the consequence, because it fails by a
fallacy of the consequent. For ‘this is distinguished form that’ can be
understood in two ways: in one way that ‘this’ means one formality and ‘that’
another formality, of which neither is the other; in another way because
‘this’ means a formality and the other means a mere negation of a formality.
Therefore to infer determinately commits the fallacy of the consequent. To the
antecedent I concede that being is formally distinguished from non-being and
non-being from being, but not in a similar way, because being is distinguished
from non-being through its own formal character[rationem], but non-being is
not formally distinguished from from being through its formal
character[rationem], because it does not have one, but because it is a formal
negation of the character [ratio] of being.",872
"To the third [objection]: I say that that to which is nothing, neither in
reality nor in the intellect, it does not befall to be predicated, and
therefore I deny the minor, if non-being is taken thus. To the proof I say
that just as the intellect grasps within itself the predication ‘nothing is
nothing’, so it grasps each extreme, and so each extreme is something in the
fiction of the intellect.",398
"To the contrary: with every act of the intellect circumscribed, this
predication ‘nothing is nothing’ is true, therefore from its own terms it has
truth and not from the intellect.",180

of reason circumscribed there is no predication, and so that predication, with
the act of the intellect circumscribed, is neither true nor false, because
under such a hypothesis it can in no way be made.",280
"I respond: from this that the intellectus conceives those negations in the
mode of positives and imposes names to them, from which [names] it composes an
enunciation.",166

thing is or is not, speech is called true or false,” from the book of the
_Categories_.",165

through the act of the intellect.",268

"I know commenting on the internet is not as much a priority as it once was,
but is there any chance you could say something about Feser's most recent post
about voluntarism? I'm strictly an amateur on medieval philosophy, and
interested more in other subjects anyhow. But I've always thought that the
voluntarism of Scotus and even Ockham was more plausible than Aquinas's
intellectualism. His take seems fishy to me, and when he hedges about ""the two
views being more complicated"" I get more suspicious still. But I am generally
out of my depth. I'd love to hear some thoughts from Scotus's perspective.",604
"Hi Adams, I always like getting comments.  
  
As for Feser, well, I find it ironic that he, a Thomist describes the
'voluntarist' personality as one that is fideist, authoritarian, etc., and yet
he begins his post with appeals to papal authority to back his position. and
Thomists are well known to be authoritarians, as can be seen from the ""thomism
and the magisteriium post"" in which Thomism is enjoined on all and sundry
based on papal documents.  
  
As to the rest, well, it may be that some voluntarists somewhere said what he
imputes to them. He seems to think that only intellectualists think the act of
the intellect precedes the act of the will. But the medieval voluntarists all
agree on that. That is not what the debate is about. Indeed, Scotus says quite
up front that the will is not an apprehensive power; it needs the intellect to
provide it with an object to will. But the intellect is entirely conditioned
by the object; it cannot not understand something, whereas the will can not
will something that the intellect shows it.  
  
The medieval debate is rather on a different sense of ""prior""; not prior in
time, rather prior in nobility (Feser is unclear here). If the will is nobler,
then it plays a more active role in the beatific vision, which accords greater
importance to the acts proper to the will, such as love (all the medieval guys
are theologians, after all; the theological application is really what they
are interested in). Sure, the intellect gives you the actual vision. but is
that the only act, or the most important act?  
  
Anyway, it is hard to give a definitive statement on what Scotus thinks, since
much of it is in book II of the Reportatio or the Quodlibet, both of which
lack reliable editions. Scotus thought at Oxford, at least, that the intellect
and will are co-causes of acts of volition. At Paris, there is debate among
scholars regarding his meaning. Some think he shifted and dropped co causality
in favor of a stronger voluntarism in which the will can do what it wishes
apart from the intellect. This would open him to charges of the capricious
will, if it is an accurate interpretation. But there are other passages where
Scotus seems to drop the notions of the itnellect and will as distinct powers,
and simply posits the soul acting in different ways. So all in all, not very
useful for polemical purposes.",2370
"Thanks for the response. I should have been more confident in my knowledge,
because my first reaction to reading Feser's piece was ""that doesn't sound
like any voluntarist I'm familiar with, not least because I'm not familiar
with any who think that the act of the will doesn't need the act of the
intellect."" But then sometimes it's hard to put that together when you're
faced with the full force of the magisterium supporting Thomism.  
  
I'm surprised, too, though perhaps I shouldn't be, that someone like Feser
appears so ignorant when it comes to other Scholastic philosophers other than
Aquinas. He wrote a book on the subject! I suppose I should have remembered
your co-blogger's review of it and taken it more to heart. I expect that
ignorance from other quarters. I once spent an evening in the company of a
close compatriot of Bishop Barron, who spent some time telling me how
voluntarism and nominalism were the same thing and all the evils of the world
descend from them, etc. I asked him about Henry of Ghent, metaphysical realist
and generally considered a voluntarist, and John Buridan, nominalist but not a
voluntarist when it comes to ethics. And he hemmed and hawed and said it
really wasn't about specific people and what they said but general trends. So
I discovered it really takes only the bare minimum of knowledge about the
middle ages to unmask the narrative - I mean, I run out of things to say about
Henry of Ghent after about five minutes, but at least I know about him, and I
know that his voluntarism is not the same as Scotus's, and if I wanted to know
whether one of them were true or not I would have to read what they said, and
not just make general claims about so-called general trends. But you know
this: you have a blog archive that says this many times already.  
  
The real tragedy, as I see it, is that this ignorance leads to more division
and argumentation (not the good kind) among people who should be allies. I
find in my catholic circles that saying I'm not a Thomist inspires more anger
than if I had said I was an atheist. I'm not sure either of those should
inspire anger, but there you go.  
  
  
Thanks again for your thoughts, and it always makes me feel a little better
knowing I'm not the only one who goes through this.  ",2281

manuscripts for most of those thinkers. Anyway, for lists of thinkers see the

"  
Dear Lee Faber,  
I am a scientist and serious amateur philosopher, not a medieval scholar. One
understands the historical situation of Jean Duns Scot. But the book is
important to me for the reason you address, i.e., it contributes to the big
picture of scholastic metaphysics. Gilson was a brilliant dialectician, and
would instinctively bring Duns Scotus into a discourse with St. Thomas, as the
two major narratives of Scholastic metaphysics. My understanding is that
Gilson's picture of Duns Scotus is largely correct, and that the translation
is skilled. These matters are important to me. As extended comparison of the
metaphysical descriptions (the ""big pictures"") provided by Aquinas and Duns
Scotus, I have only Sylwanowicz' book on contingent causality. Are there any
other works that provide such perspective?  
It would be a vast misfortune were it to be determined that all Duns Scotus
scholarship prior to the present era of computerized database scholarship is
simply wrong-headed. It would put Duns Scotus on a par with St. Thomas, all of
whose earlier scholars simply failed to understand him, according to the
participationists. Amazing - the Modernist belief that one must - or can -
Start Over in scholarship!",1233
"Jim, two points.  
  
1\. Gilson. I have not read the entire thing, but what I have read seemed
accurate enough. He avoids-from what I have seen-the 'big picture' claims of
static essentialism and unravelling of scholasticism one finds in Being and
Some Philosophers. As to other similar books, all I can think of at the moment
is Allan Wolter's Transcendentals book, old but largely still good, or
Honnefelder, if you read German.  
  
2\. Dated Scholarship. The problem is, that Wadding included numerous texts in
his edition that are spurious, and these were all accepted as being by Scotus
until scholars started studying manuscirpts of Scotus in the 1930's or so. And
even then, it was only a small group of radicals that started doing that. So
really, I would say non-specialists should not read anything earlier than
Gilson's book,save for Wolter's book mentioned above, and longpre's long
essay. Harris' two volume comparison of Aquinas and Scotus is a good example
of why: he found in the wadding edition the quaestiones de rerum principio,
which have among other things, a strong endorsement of spiritual matter. This
fit with Harris' view of Scotus as a strong platonist, and he refused to deny
their authenticity, which apparently had been challenged even in his day. But
some years later the manuscripts were discovered and it was found that the
work is not even by Scotus at all, and all the other cases of spiritual matter
in Scotus' genuine works are simply mentions as a theory belonging to other
masters.  
  
On the whole, though, I don't think we could really have a comprehensive book
on Scotus until the Parisian works are edited. There is much modification or
explanation there of his Oxford theories. Of course the current trend is to
explain all such passages as changes of mind, making Scotus into a sort of
weak willed ninny who can't make up his mind and allegedly drastically changes
his position all within a few years of going from Oxford to Paris (drops
univocity of being, walks back the formal disitnction, etc. etc.). No, I think
it is the current period of Scotus scholarship that will end up being obviated
once the edition is done. Though at least we know now what Scotus actually
wrote!",2225
"We love it when scholars change their mind; it shows how they adjusted their
thinking.  
The problem with ""dated scholarship"" is that most people approaching Scotus
approach him already knowing what he said. This causes a problem when those
people are editors, as they start making editorial choices based on
questionable notions of purity, antiquity, and all that. We run into this all
the time, on the small scale, but especially on the large scale.  
  
How do they get away with these choices? Well, in part, because the editing of
medieval texts is something of a pseudoscience. There's a lot of theories out
there, and we can construct tests for some of our hypotheses, but almost
nobody does that.  
  
The editions form the foundation for the higher-level analyses, and if the
editions are based on questionable choices, then the higher-level analyses
start to fail. The apex analyses (""the big pictures"") are the most vulnerable.  
  
This is where looking at early Scotists like Petrus Thomae can be fun: you can
start to see how Scotus' contemporaries saw him, what they saw as important,
and what they disagreed with. They themselves will let you know (sometimes)
whether they're normalizing or pushing Scotus' thought. At the same time, no
witness, direct or indirect, can ever provide a coherent picture.  
  
The price tag is always a pain, but not even libraries are buying the physical
copies these days.",1421
"What tests do you have in mind? Peter Thomae might be a good candidate to run
them, since the text is fairly short, compared to say a Sentences-commentary.",155
"Some tests that you can run:  
  
1\. Study cases where manuscript A is a direct copy of B. As editors, we throw
these out as having zero value as witnesses to the text. But if you look at
them, you can find phenomena of transmission. Also, you'll find that a
manuscript changes after it's been read: copyists will correct ""obvious""
faults in their exemplar.  
2\. Test an editorial method in a case where both the original survives and a
decent number of copies circulate. I have some ideas ware we can find
something like that.",529

"  
I'm surprised that Robert Pasnau does not teach fro his own recent, rather
large history, as textbook. This commentary is quite strange. And revealing.  
He say:  
""As things are, there certainly is no such common core. Perhaps the only text
from medieval philosophy that philosophically educated folk can be expected to
know about is Anselm’s ontological argument. Beyond that, there’s just a whole
lot of more or less obscure stuff, from among which we pick and choose in
making up the curriculum for a medieval survey.""  
  
And:  
""But, at least, if you are trying to lead students through Kant, there is a
sense of doing something that fits into a larger narrative and a shared
intellectual heritage.""  
  
How strange that Dr. Pasnau would concentrate in an area of intellectual
history that simply does not seem important to him. Perhaps he considers the
medievals to be intellectually ambitious, elaborately disputateous (how many
angels could fit?), but finally just a blend of bad theology (i.e. Thomist
paganism) and bad science (i.e., Aristotelian rationalism). Is that possible?  
  
Aquinas' Summa is not part of the canon, but Kant's Critique is? Spoken like
one who concludes that Kant showed metaphysics to be fundamentally misguided-  
  
I think that Dr. Pasnau must, as he apparently is; as all of us must do at
some point; asking himself: Why is all this challenging, marginalized
scholarship so important to me?  
  
  ",1444
"One would probably have to recognize the explicit religious nature of most
medieval philosophy, and divide it according to the religions of Judaism,
Islam, and Christianity. How to do justice to any of those in one-two
semesters is beyond me. Each would have its own narrative, and indeed, they
are received in different ways by each other (14th c. Jewish philosophers, for
example, translate Latin Scotism to combat Arabic Averroism).  
  
I would just teach major figures and a few characteristic doctrines on a
general topic. It would be easier to incorporate Avicenna into the ""narrative""
of modality than into a grand narrative running a thousand years. Or medieval
metaphysics as a science of transcendentals is a clear development of greek
philosophy and can be usefully compared to modern thought.  
  
In latin circles, I don't think there can be a narrative yet, since I think
the 14th and 15th c. are basically a black hole. and it is not as if islamic
and jewish philosophy ceased to exist when the universities were founded. Once
could advance the almost vapid claim that the 13th century was a century of
system-building, the 14th century one of critical analysis or problem solving,
the 15th, what, an age of scholarship?  
  
The English speaking world of medieval philosophy is almost purely analytic
now. I generally don't see their motivation to work on this material. It seems
obvious, since scholastic philosphy is very dialectical as is modern analytic
philosophy. But as Lenz has pointed out in other posts, there is no ""us"" among
analytic philosophers to compare medieval thought with, that is a widely
agreed upon position on X problem. current analytic thought is as diverse as
medieval, so what is the point of drawing a comparison? I am not saying my
practice of reconstructing arcane debates for my own interest is better. I
have no readership and no dialogue partners. But ""real"" analytic philosophers
just make a joke about 'substance abuse"" and move on, without taking any of it
seriously, strengthened in their belief that nothing happened between
Aristotle and Descartes. Pasnau's common narrative might be able to impact
this prejudice, but I doubt it. Again, because medieval thought is so
explicitly religious, and modern philosophy is so anti religious.",2291
"Yes, one must recognize the religion/core loyalties of the creator of a text
and the resultant ideology and agenda that produces. I illustrate the
importance of the latter by considering the case of the Radically Orthodox,
who seem to have a project of creating a form of Christianity both convenient
for ecumenical purposes, and also acceptable to a totalitarian state. They
favor creating a version of Aquinas who was influenced only by Plato, and neo-
Platonism; and not at all by Aristotle. This is an ideology free of
substantial forms capable of grounding Church doctrine on human nature. It
lacks any deep grounding in classical philosophy, and thus has no natural
philosophy or theology to offer. This makes the Radically Orthodox acceptable
to the Bible Christians. Finally it pleases the government social engineers,
because it can offer no principled opposition, grounded in a Christian account
of human nature, to their plans to remake that human nature.  
  
Analytic philosophy has no Grand Narrative, but does seem to favor a meta-
narrative; an account of how such Grand Narratives are to be evaluated.
Specifically, most analytic philosophy, in its choices and emphases,
implicitly buys into the Modernist claim that the purpose of philosophy e.g.
in secondary education, is to teach logic and the philosophy of science. It
also is useful for training students in rhetoric and the art of disputation.
But the coherent and principled interpretation of these texts, and the
worldview they imply, seems to be irrelevant to the analytics.  
  
Modernism was a transitional stage between a Christian Western civilization
and the totalitarian state to come. It was, as you say, ""anti-religious"". I
would argue that Post-Modern thought is very religious, being grounded in a
revolutionary Phariseeism. Our purpose is to overthrow the evil world-based
institutions we have, including the churches, which are corrupt and distracted
by superstition; and set about building heaven here on earth. Jacques Derrida,
in his later writings, has spoken in detail of the importance of his religious
heritage in forming his Deconstructive philosophy.  
  
An influential philosophy professor at a top 10 school must, when they speak
of a ""canon"" a priori be assumed to be addressing the problem of uniform
standards for  
educating participants in a global revolutionary government. From this
perspective Dr. Pasnau's statements make perfect sense.",2446
"Medieval philosophy seems like a good illustration of Chesterton's claim that

trying to keep up with the trends. They're worth reading because the things
they talked about were and remain important and interesting - at least as much
so as the things modern philosophers talk about.

"This post is not about Scotus.  
  
One of the benefits of no longer being in institutional academia (condolences
to my esteemed co-blogger) is that I can study whatever I want without regard
to my curriculum vitae or departmental or disciplinary expectations. What I've
been studying most lately is Greek. At long last I'm getting close to
finishing my first complete read-through of both the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_
in Greek. This wonderful experience has confirmed my long-held sense that
Homer is the king of all poets: as someone or other said, Homer is the proof
that there is no progress in the arts. There may be a very few who could claim
to be _as great_ , but there are none greater, none more beautiful, none more
insightful, none more intricate. As I reach the end I'm struck more and more
by the realization that there is nothing more subtle and psychologically
penetrating in all of literature than the final quarter of the _Odyssey_.  
  
My most beloved writers from antiquity other than Homer, Plato and Vergil,
were also surely antiquity's most careful readers of and thinkers about Homer;
and he has helped me understand them better. Thanks to the _Odyssey_ I think
I've solved two of classical literature's greatest mysteries: the meaning of
the end of _Aeneid_ book VI, and the identity of the Athenian Stranger in
Plato's _Laws_.  
  
I.  
  
Penelope tells Odysseus in _Od._ 19.562-567: ""For two are the gates of shadowy
dreams, and one is fashioned of horns, the other of ivory. Those that pass
through the gate of carved ivory deceive, bringing things unfulfilled; but
those that come through the gate of polished horn bring true things to
fulfillment, when anyone among mortals sees them."" Now Penelope, not openly
acknowledging that she recognizes her returned husband, is scheming with him
in riddles so that the servants don't understand and betray him to the
suitors. She's just described an invented allegorical ""dream"" in which
Odysseus returns and kills the suitors, and she's just about to propose the
trial of the bow. So this statement about the nature of dreams, coming between
those two moments, is Penelope's way of telling Odysseus how to accomplish his
task of winning back his household without getting himself and his family
killed.  
  
Ivory is the material of scabbards. Odysseus is given a sword with an ivory
scabbard earlier in the poem, and such scabbards were known in the classical
world. Horn, on the other hand, is the material of bows. Penelope is telling
Odysseus that yes, he must kill the suitors, but not by passing through the
gate of ivory, not by drawing the sword, because that way is false, it won't
be successful. He must pass through the gate of horn, that is, win the trial
of the bow, her own device for getting a weapon only he can use into the hands
of Odysseus, when no one else is armed, a device she is about to explain. The
false way, the gate of ivory, is the straightforward way of Achilles, the path
of sheer immediate brute force; the true way, the gate of horn, is the
polytropic, twisty, curved, clever, tricky way of Odysseus, the path of
contest-winning (Odysseus won the contest for the arms of Achilles against
Ajax, and wins his contests against the Phaeacians), biding one's time, and
deception (he, of course, deceives practically everyone he meets in the poem
at one point or another).  
  
At the end of Aeneas' journey through the underworld Vergil says ( _Aeneid_
6.893-896) ""The gates of sleep are twins; one of which is said to be of horn,
whereby an easy outlet is given to true shades (shadows, _umbris_ ); the other
finished and gleaming with shining ivory, but [through it] the shades
(spirits, _Manes_ ) send false things to heaven."" Aeneas leaves Hades and goes
back to the mortal world through the gate of ivory. Why?  
  
The first half of the _Aeneid_ is Odyssean: Aeneas wanders, is troubled by a
vengeful god, tells his story, has a love affair with a beautiful woman who
offers a tempting alternative to his destiny, and descends to the underworld
where he sees the spirit of a deceased, beloved parent and is told about the
future. The second half of the poem is Iliadic, or rather Achilleic: Aeneas
battles over a woman and a truce-breaking and kills a lot of people. On the
basic level, then, Aeneas' passing through the gate of ivory shows his
transition from the Odyssean to the Achilleic stage: he ceases to wander over
the ocean's curve, unsheathing his straight sword.  
  
On a deeper level I think his taking the ivory gate indicates the
fundamentally un-Odyssean character both of the man and the poem. ""Arma
virumque cano"", Vergil begins, ""arms and the man I sing"", but though a story
of arms reflects the _Iliad_ and a story of a man and his wanderings suggests
the _Odyssey_ , Aeneas himself is nothing like Odysseus at all. Odysseus is a
hated figure in the _Aeneid_ and in the Roman worldview in general; dishonest,
dishonorable, undignified and untrustworthy, quite the opposite of _pius
Aeneas_ , the archetypal Roman. His journey mirrors Odysseus' in only the most
superficial way. Taking the ivory gate informs us that the way of Achilles,
the way of the drawn sword, is compatible with the Roman character in a way
that the way of Odysseus, the way of the bow and the lyre, is not.  
  
But the Roman, Achilleic way is not the true way. We know this because Homer
tells us so. In Hell Odysseus says to Achilles, how wonderful it must be to be
the greatest and most honored of all the shades of Elysium! But Achilles
replies that he would rather be the slave of the poorest farmer, alive, than
king of all the dead. And yet in life Achilles could not abide the disrespect
even of a king, while Odysseus stooped to being abused even by slaves in order
to get his home and family back.  
  
An easy outlet, Vergil says, is given to true shadows through the gate of
horn, while the shades send false things to heaven through that of ivory. A
shade, that of Anchises, sends Aeneas back to the living world through this
gate; Aeneas is later deified as the founder of Rome; Aeneas is a false thing
sent to heaven.  
  
Pious Aeneas' un-Odyssean character is highlighted by his relationship to the
goddesses. The three goddesses most important to the Matter of Troy are
Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite, or to the Romans Pallas Minerva, Juno, and Venus.
These were the goddesses involved in the Judgement of Paris, the cause of the
Trojan War. Now it's a curious fact that even though the _Odyssey_ is
permeated by the interplay of the themes of love and the family - Odysseus has
love affairs with two goddesses, the realm of Aphrodite, but is ultimately
determined to get back to hearth and home, the realm of Hera - only Athena
takes any interest in the matter. She has a prominent role, while Aphrodite
and Hera never appear on the stage at all. Odysseus' _story_ is dominated by
the forces of Aphrodite and Hera, but his _character_ is all identified with
Athena. This is precisely reversed in the Aeneid: Athena has no part to play,
and the two most prominent Olympian actors are Venus and Juno. Like Odysseus,
in order to achieve his fate Aeneas must overcome Venus in the form of his
love for Dido, and embrace Hera, in the form of Lavinia, the wife he marries
to establish a home. But Odysseus' struggle to return to Penelope is what he
_wants_ , because he loves her more than than the goddesses Circe and Calypso
or the mortal princess Nausicaa (their characters are more alike than any two
others in all of Homer); while Aeneas marries Lavinia out of duty and cares
nothing about her personally or erotically. But Aeneas is the son of Venus -
embracing Hera out of piety is precisely rejecting his own nature, being false
to himself. He doesn't seem to recognize this. It's not clear that he knows
his own nature, whereas Odysseus does, thanks to Hermes' gift of the moly
plant on Circe's island. And so while capitulating to Juno is the price of
Juno relenting in her anger against the Trojans, it comes at the cost of the
total assimilation of the Trojans into the Latin people, the disappearance
without a trace of their language and culture. Trojans ""founded"" Rome but lost
their nature. Aphrodite won the judgment of Paris but lost the war for
posterity.  
  
Pallas Athena plays no special role in the _Aenead_ , but someone else named
Pallas does, Aeneas' young ally. Pallas is killed by Turnus, and this is the
reason Aenead kills Turnus at the shocking, abrupt, brutal conclusion of the
poem: ""'Pallas strikes you with this blow, Pallas sacrifices you and takes
atonement from guilty blood!' Saying this, burning, he buried the iron in his
chest. But from that one [Turnus] the limbs were loosed with cold, and his
grudging life with a groan fled under the shadows."" The echo of the name
suggests that in the absence of the wisdom of Pallas (recall from book I of
the _Iliad_ and elsewhere that Athena is a special friend of Achilles as well
as of Odysseus) Aeneas does not learn the lesson of Achilles, that of
compassion for a defeated enemy, and so his poem ends not in melancholic
sympathy and understanding, as the _Iliad_ does, but in ugly horror. Aeneas
sends Turnus to the shadows, the _umbras_ , which escape easily through the
gate of horn, but he himself is sent by the shadows, the _manes_ of the dead,
to embrace the lie that Rome's glory can be bought only with violence. But it
is a lie: the glory of Rome bought by violence faded into the shadows. The
eternal Roman empire was founded only on the reversal of Roma back into Amor,
when Rome was planted with the seed of charity, its soil watered with the
blood of the martyrs, and the State transformed into the Church.  
  
This is why the medievals thought that Vergil was a magician and a prophet.

Who is the Athenian Stranger of Plato's _Laws_? The _Laws_ is the only one of
Plato's dialogues in which Socrates is not named as a participant. Aristotle
says that the Stranger is Socrates even if not named. But Socrates famously
never left the environs of Athens except to defend her in war. Cicero says
that the Stranger is Plato himself. Leo Strauss suggests that the _Laws_ is a
kind of thought-experiment: in the _Laws_ we see what might happen if after
the _Crito_ Socrates avoided execution after all, escaped anonymously to
Crete, and there had this discussion. Who is right?  
  
1\. Throughout most of the second half of the Odyssey Odysseus pretends to be
from Crete, either to be a Cretan or at least to have had adventures and come
from there to Ithaca ferried by Cretans. In all his stories he mentions how he
met Odysseus, knew Odysseus, has all the news about Odysseus and his imminent
return. It's a lie, but it's a lie that mirrors the truth: he had adventures
on islands, most recently Phaeacia, and was ferried to Ithaca by Phaeacians,
and of course he knows all the news about himself. The stories he tells didn't
happen, but they say something true, and the Cretan Stranger is himself
Odysseus.  
  
2\. Plato's _Critias_ tells the story of a war against Atlantis in which the
Athenians won a spectacular victory, greater than the victories of the Persian
Wars. It's a lie, but a lie that's a mirror-image of the truth: the Athenians
did fight a war with a great island, a war greater than the Persian Wars (if
Thucydides is to be believed), namely Sicily, but they suffered a terrible and
ignominious defeat. The story of Atlantis in the _Critias_ is too good to be
true because it comes in the wake of the story of the _Republic_ (whose sequel
it is) about a city too good to be true, a city ruled by philosophers, while
the bitter truth about Sicily reflects the truth about the real city of
Athens.  
  
3\. There is one other important Stranger in Plato's dialogues, the Eleatic
Stranger of the _Sophist_ and the _Statesman_. In the _Parmenides_ the
original Eleatic philosopher discourses with the young Socrates, teaching him
how to think about and overcome the flaws in the simplistic Socratic
hypothesis of the independent Forms. At the end of Socrates' life there is a
mirror image of this discussion. The Eleatic stranger is not the long-dead
Parmenides, but he speaks like him, not to now-old Socrates, but to a mirrored
pair of interlocutors, Thucydides who shares Socrates' looks, and another
young man who shares his name. The Elder Socrates stands silently by while the
Eleatic Stranger teaches the two young Socrateses to correct the inadequacies
in both his ontological and his political speculations.  
  
4\. In the _Laws_ an Athenian who could not be Socrates, but who thinks and
talks like Socrates, comes to the island of Crete and talks with a Spartan and
a Cretan politician about founding a city on philosophical principles, a city
that would avoid the inadequacies of Socrates' unrealistic Republic. In real
life Plato, an Athenian student of Socrates, went to the island of Sicily to
persuade a tyrant to run a state on philosophical principles. In real life,
the Athenian military expedition against Sicily was a disastrous failure; in
real life, Plato's philosophical expedition to Sicily was a disastrous failure
too. In the dialogues, Athens won a long-ago, never-never-land but spectacular
victory against an ancient island empire; in the dialogues, the Athenian
stranger, speaking with the representatives of the deepest Hellenic antiquity,
the elderly heirs of the Homeric Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations, makes a
spectacular philosophical and political conversion. Cicero is right: the
Athenian Stranger is Plato.",13592

“Logic is a means of leading us from one intuition or insight to the next”.  
  
The way of the sword and the way of the bow and arrow make a brilliant
metaphor for the way of logic and the way of intuition. Logic makes binary
distinctions; it separates what is from what is not. But the bow and arrow aim
to hit the mark, to focus the precise locus or place of maximum
importance/vulnerability/possibility. But in aiming too fixedly at the mark,
why does one always miss the mark and fall into hamartia?  
  
Are these the path of Revelation and the path of Concealment; as the two paths
of Parmenides?  
  
The sword is wielded by a user who retains control throughout the strike. But
the arrow is given up by the bow at the point of greatest tension; it falls
from the bow. The arrow is not in any sense thrown at the target; it is drawn
to the target at its release. In this sense, time moves forward in the drawing
of the bow, is suspended at the point of greatest tension, then runs backward
toward its result. Mature Greek thought comes to account for this failure of
action; the initial straining forward toward a Future which is not yet; the
alienation of the act from the actor as it takes on a life of its own; and its
final realization in the solidity of the past. The poet of the Illiad senses
that the great hero is most heroic when he supersedes his own intentions; when
he becomes ecstatic; senses this, but cannot yet account for it.  
  
I’m not sure I follow your use of this distinction in terms of the Greek Way
and the Roman Way, although I find it provocative. Is your thesis that Roman
thought is completed by Christian thought, just as the Iliad is completed by
the Odyssey? My attempt at a classical reading of your theme makes the sword
and the bow complementary, whereas you describe one Way as “true” and the
other Way as “false”. But perhaps I misread you as preferring the True to the
False, as being morally superior? Perhaps the two come inevitably to
complement each other in any vision of life? Perhaps Odysseus, as the master
of both the false and the true, adds the latter to the Greek tradition in
order to complete it; just as the path of Falsity/darkness completes the path
of Truth/light for Parmenides.  
  
This discussion is not about Duns Scotus. But the Catholic tradition certainly
comes to embody both sides of this duality. We are children of Light who yet
walk in darkness. We are Saved, but still tested. For me Aquinas is too much
the theologian of Light; a writer of theology for angels. Duns Scotus accounts
much more adequately for sin; for human Fallenness; for the essential nature
of will; for Milton’s Satan.

"  
So. Two kinds of analogy. The first is of many to one or one to another, in
which the _ratio_ (definition, meaning, formal character, etc.) is diverse in
the analogates, but focused on one central notion. The second is in which
there is only one _ratio_ , that itself is said univocally, but it is found in
its univocates in relations of prior-posterior, more-less. This latter kind of
analogy is that which obtains between God and creatures. So God is prior,
creatures posterior; creatures participate in God, and such is seen by Gonteri
(and indeed by Scotists) to be compatible with univocity, even in the same
concept. The description of analogy as predication of the prior and posterior
goes back to the Arabs, and the combination with univocity perhaps is a result
of the ambiguity in Avicenna. Avicenna describes being as being said in the
prior and posterior way, and yet scholars of the latin and arabic texts have
never managed to agree wither or not he holds to univocity as well.

form of univocity in his Sent. I d. 1, a text that was resurrected by
Alexander de Alexandria and used to attack Scotus. Thus I've generally assumed
a disconuity between Scotus and Bonaventure on this point.",360
"You're right about Bonaventure denying univocity in Sent. d1, dub. 5 quite
clearly. It's interesting that when B. denies univocity it seems he is
operating with an understanding of univocity inclusive of commonality of both
name and reality (res). I don't think Bonaventure ever explicitly goes away
from this take on univocity, towards a consideration of formal content and
concept alone. However, his treatment of one-to-one similitude-analogy (rooted
in his semiotic metaphysics) according to prior/posterior, etc. in the De
scientia Christi, his use, in De mysterio Trinitatis, of the transcendental
disjuncts and perfections simpliciter and secundum quid (which seem to
function like simple and simply simple perfections in Scotus) converge upon a
strong similarity to the second sort of univocity in Brito: a common quality,
ratio with intrinsically different modes: finite/infinite. Bonaventure like
Brito seems to preserve analogy of first type as well as employ and frame
univocity along the lines of Brito's second type all the while denying
univocity between God and creatures in terms of commonality of both name and
reality. An arguable point to be sure, but a latent yet functional univocity
of concept seems to be at work in Bonaventure, and he only seems to deny
univocity under the description above; not, perhaps, under Scotus's more
refined description of univocity.  
  
I don't know, beyond Veuthey's likely dated book, Alexander. I think I
remember that Peter John Olivi (d. 1298) is the last person to cite either of
the disputed questions mentioned above, however. Although, much of what is
presented in Bonaventure's disputed questions is already present in the
Sentence Commentaries, because of layout, order or whatever, the disputed
questions help to shed light on many of Bonaventure pre-Scotistic tendencies,
even if the clear(-er) formulation had to wait for Scotus.  
  
Pardon me for going off topic from the original post in my first reply.  
  
JI Goff",1987
"It's similar to the problem of comparing Aquinas and Scotus; Scotus seems to
have invented the sense of univocity that is commonality of concept alone. So
he would agree, in a way, with Bonaventure, Henry, and Aquinas that being is
not univocal in the sense that there is a common ality outside the soul in
which things agree that corresponds exactly with the univocal concept.

"From the blurb, would it be fair to say this is meant as a reasonably
accessible introduction to Scotus? I sure hope so. This blog has convinced me
I should look into Scotus, but it seems that it's really just Mary Beth
Ingham's books that occupy that niche. The following review of Cross's book
has turned me away from it, for example:  
  
""I bought the book hoping that I would get a clear explanation of Scotus'
views from within. Instead I found an exposition of an analytic philosophers
contracted views on Scotus. To be blunt, Cross should not presume that the
reader cares about his views in a work that purports to expound Scotus' views.
I find this to be a common defect amongst the analytic philosophers, who seem
intent upon telling us that we can make good use mediaeval philosophy, but
fail to see that they themselves are peripheral to that ressourcement. I give
it three stars for the sake of Duns Scotus, not for the sake of Cross. Beware
also his work on the Physics of Duns Scotus, unless, that is, you are an
analytic philosopher.""  
  
Is that accurate?",1074
"Will be interesting. Vos's book on Scotus' philosophy remains helpful. It's
worthy of note (ominous?) that the book appears in the Studies in Reformed
Theology series and there is no mention, in the TOC at least, of Scotus'
Mariology.  
  
JI Goff",247
"Anonymous, it's hard to say, since I can't get any inside views yet and don't
have a hard copy. Vos' philosophy book was wide ranging, with a massive
introduction summarizing all the history of interpretation and arguments over
the facts of Scotus' life etc., that may not be all that useful to total
beginners. And he has his own interests, so, for example, if I were to write a
summary or into to Scotus' philosophy, I would probably start with what
metaphysics is and how univocity and demonstration function in Scotus'
thought. But Vos devotes only a page or two to univocity,, but has a massive
study of contingency which he sees as significant for later calvinism. So I
don't know that he intends it as an introduction. I would say the same about
Cross. His ""Duns Scotus"" in the great medieval thinkers series is meant as an
introduction, but none of his other books. Certainly not the PHysics, or the
Incarnation book. Duns Scotus on God is closer, but not an introduction to a
total beginner. IN a way, the best introduction is just to read medieval texts
by Bonaventure and Aquinas to get the basic medieval problematic. Ingham's
books are also actually intended as introductions, and they seem to me to be
largely paraphrases and explanations. Cross' presuppose knowledge of analytic
philosophy as much as they presuppose some background in Scotus. Thus I find
it truly bizarre that modern theologians now take Cross as the basic
explanation for Scotus, on say Christology, neglecting to read Scotus at all.
In my experience, modern theologians have very little or no training in say
the pre modern philosophical tradition, but also none in analytic philosophy.
So in the case of using Cross, there is the extra layer of analytic phil.
bewteen them and Scotus, that they won't even notice since they also know
nothing about Scotus.  
  
Anyway, as to that review you quote, it depends what it is from, since as I
said, I don't think Cross' books are intended as introductions. It also
depends who the ""we"" is in the review, since the ""appropriation"" of medieval
thought by aanalytic philosophers is largely written and conduction for
themselves and their friends; it is not intended to be a lasting
interpretation, as was, say, Gilson's idea of christian philosophy in Aquinas.  
  
Jl Goff, yes, I was also struck by the appearance of the volume in the
Reformed theology series. Why not just publish it with the same press that did
the other book? But I did not notice that there was no Marian chapter. It
would seem rather hard to pull that off. There would have to some mention of
the doctrine that historically was far more controversial than the univocity
of being.",2680
"  
I am a devout Catholic, as was B. John Duns Scotus. I would not recommend a
work of Calvinist theology as a good overview for the theology of Duns Scotus.
But if a person were interested in use of Duns Scotus' thought in Calvinist
apology, I would recommend for them the book by William Lane Craig, ""Divine
Foreknowledge and Human Freedom"". This seems to me to be a correct account of
Duns Scotus (and many other metaphysicians) on the metaphysical doctrines
underlying an adequate account of human freedom and its compatibility with
Divine omnipotence and omniscience. This is not at all a complete view of Duns
Scotus' thought, but rather a detailed critique of key doctrines of his. As
others have noted, Calvinist writers will seldom wish to present all the ideas
of Duns Scotus.",786

it omits the Marian theology. Vos I think is involved with the series it is

a calvinist. I did not detect any proselytizing etc. in his book on Scotus'
philosophy, though I didn't read the end of it. certainly Vos thinks Scotus
was influential in reformed thought, but that is not the same thing.

the philosophy book had a similar chapter, philosophy in a new key.",451
"I'm about half-way through the book. It's, so far as I can tell, pretty solid
to this point as an intro text and as engaging contemporary theological
thought (likely weighted towards Protestant thought, although I haven't paid
too close attention on this point). As one would expect with Vos there is a
great degree of emphasis (though not exclusive) upon the Lectura texts and
upon synchronic contingency. He does a good job of distinguishing between
necessary and contingent theology and framing his presentation of Scotus
accordingly. Vos actually seems to push back against ""forensic justification""
and recommends a return to or at least a reconsideration of pre-
Reformation/Counter Reformation formulations of the question, strongly
emphasizing the need for history and systematics to work to together. There is
a strong tendency to mitigate Old Testament events and commands and to favor a
demythologization qua historical research in the field of Scotus's ethics. He
makes a couple mistakes in his presentation of Scotus's theology of the
Trinity, too. Overall the text is much less technical than Vos's philosophy
counterpart. Sadly, the text is riddled with typos... to point of distraction.

of Aristotle’s text by caption letters. It appears that Duns Scotus kept
adding to those notes in the course of his career.  
  
The _Notabilia_ offers a unique perspective on Duns Scotus’s interpretation of
Aristotle’s _Metaphysics_. It also contains several original insights on key
philosophical issues.  
  
This work disappeared from circulation at Duns Scotus’s death and was

in about ten years once we start editing Scotus' Reportatio III. In the

that later scotist discussion is often illuminating. There are commentaries in
the Wadding edition from the 17th c., and printed editions available online of
Peter of Aquila's III Sent., John Bassols III Sent., as well as the anonymous

Can you tell us why Gilson's book on Duns Scotus is worthwhile, granting your

get Duns Scotus right before getting him wrong, i.e., in Being and Some
Philosophers? Is there a good critical review of this book, which emphasizes
what is enduring in it? I tend to blame Gilson for the ""essentialist"" label,
which is a caricature as usually developed.",442
"Well, it is interesting to see his ahistorical comparison of the thought of
Aquinas and Scotus. Probably no one else has put them in dialogue to such a
degree, and in that book Gilson is trying to be fair to Scotus. Being and Some
philosophers is a different story, and I do not recommend it to anyone
interested in what Scotus actually held. The same is true of the Unity of the
philosophical experience, which isnt about Scotus at all, but the basic idea
of the medieval section is that medieval philosophy failed and became corrupt
because it did not bow down and accept evertything Thomas had said, i.e. they
did not reject philosopyh and become thomist dogmatists. Gilson even describes
the mere fact that in 1320 there was a thomist school and a scotistist school
and various augustinian schools as an ethical failure on the part of medieval
philosophers. Thus, there is something morally blameworthy in disagreeing with
Thomas. Gilson ultimately then seems to see theology and philosophy as coming
to an end with the coming of Thomas. So no, I only recommend the Duns Scotus
monograph, with certain qualifications. The best study so far is that of
Pomplun that I mentioned some posts below. He gives all the background on
Gilson in previous historiography and considers Gilson's changing attitudes to
Scotus.",1315

"  
  
On further reflection, I was rather struck by the Latin quote from Ockham that
Barron references: ""praeter illas partes absolutas nulla res est"". He says by
it Ockham is stating a principle, but Barron does not tell us what the
principle is. That God is in a genus? That being is univocal? That being is a
genus? That God is one individual alongside other individuals? Does Barron
think that, according to Ockham, God and creatures are parts of some whole?  
  
  
The quote comes from Ockham's Ordinatio I d. 30 (OTh IV, 317). This question
is a debate about relations. Scotus had held that relations were really
distinct from their terms, and this question of Ockham's consists of quoting
Scotus' arguments verbatim and refuting them. So it is odd, to say the least,
for Barron to group Scotus with Ockham here. The quote is from some exegesis
of Aristotle's Metaphysics XII. Ockham, annoyingly, in this question only
talks about what can be known by pure reason, and so he does not talk about
God at all, save in this reply to Scotus. So it clear why Barron would want to
cite this passage, since even though there are many mentions of Ockham's view
int he question, that relations are not really distinct or absolute beings,
only substances are, none of them directly concern God. But Barron does
misrepresent the context of the quote, I would say.  
  
  
But this is not a question about univocity. And even the conclusion is not
terribly controversial, i.e. that relations are not absolute things or really
distinct. It was quite common in medieval thought to argue about this, long
before Ockham and Scotus, and I see no connection to the univocity debate.
There was some debate about whether quality and quantity were absolute
categories like substance, Ockham here is denying that relations are real or
absolute.  
  
  
Barron's comments are then turning a rather mundane medieval position into a
consequence of univocity, even though people who deny univocity could hold it
and those who hold univocity could deny it. Indeed, Scotus holds univocity but
is the target of Ockham's attack in the very passage Barron quotes. But there
are no rules in the narrative game.  
  
  
The ultimate root of Barron's comments here is the neoplatonist strand in
academic thomist theologians, combined with continental speculation. The
dependence of creation on God entails, for modern thomist theologians, the
idea that humans cannot be granted any ontological standing in their own
right, even though even on thomist natural philosophy human beings et al. are
all substances, are individuals, have causal powers, support accidents, etc.
And oddly, God is somehow not an individual, but way way beyond such mundane
notions, though they never bother to explain that God isn't just a universal
or an abstract object, what one normally would contrast an individual with.  
  
  
So in the end, Barron is sort of right, at least that Thomism and Scotism are
incompatible on many points. For Thomism, God is subsistent being itself, for
Scotism God is an infinite This. The Scotist view for Barron entails
competition between God and creatures; Barron thinks that this competition is
bad and leads to protestantism. But competition would seem to be a datum of
the human experience, at least if Barron's other views, are correct, that is,
given that he is a Catholic Bishop he believes in human sin, and what is sin
other than the assertion of one's own will and choice over the divine
law/wish/choice? But there was sin prior to Scotus' theory of the univocity of
the concept of being, so I think we can absolve univocity of the competition
charge, at least.",3658
"I never cease to be bewildered by the constant lumping of Scotus and Ockham
together under the rubric of nominalism, which is identified with unabated
evil, and then both Franciscan masters are dismissed with great solemnity!
What is more, if univocity is so horrific--the invention of the Antichrist, as
Barth might suggest--then why doesn't Albert the Great figure more prominently
in their ""narratives"" of the decline of the West? Albert, after all, speaks of
a ""univocatio quae est analogiae"" as well as divine univocal causality. And in
this he is followed by other Dominicans such as Ulrich of Strasbourg. But,
unlike Scotus, Albert isn't restricting himself to a purely semantic
discourse, making his account even more challenging. Maybe Albert is just too
close to Thomas--who took the dictation of the Super Dion. Dear div. Nom.,
where the terms are raised--for comfort.  
Best,  
Victor",896
"Victor, thanks for an interesting remark. I recall your article on Albert on
this topic, and since reading it I have often wondered about his views, and
how different they are from Scotus'.  
  
In my darker moments I wonder if all these philosophical and theological
differences aren't really just positions adopted as part of a much broader
political struggle, that of Franciscan Order vs. Dominican Order. Both were --
and one still is -- a major powerhouse in the church, both were highly jealous
of their privileges and anxious to increase their power. It's true the
franciscans tended to be more intellectually diverse, but would someone ever
join them but retain a passionate love of thomistic analogy? Or was it rather
that people met individuals from the orders, were inspired to join, and then
adopted the classic order positions as part of the educational process, and
then carried on the war for another generation?",927
"Well whether or not the differences are adopted merely as a result of some
political struggle, I don't think there can be any doubt that those struggles
definitely helped shape the terms of the debate. This becomes especially
obvious with the De auxiliis controversy, which just adds another religious
order (Jesuits) to the mix. It's really fascinating, then, to read through the
various cursus of the Jesuits (esp. Suárez) as they really capture the
dynamics involved in the debates with the ""Thomists,"" the ""Scotists,"" the
""Nominalists,"" etc. It's like witnessing a major battle royal. No wonder poor
Descartes just wanted a basic foundation to stand upon!  
  
Best,  
Victor",679
"Emphasizing Thomas' Neo-Platonism to the exclusion of his Aristotelianism is,
as I understand matters, what is really at stake here. Te resulting flood of
European, especially French mysticism during the twentieth century should be
acceptable, both to Barth and to the Ecumenical Catholics. What can we really
know, on this account of God by unaided reason? Does God exist? I think for
this mentality, the answer must be NO.  
God is Being, and thus may not possess Being, right? Perhaps by a great leap
of faith beyond reason. Can one not bedevil the Newly Orthodox with this
question, of how one can possibly comprehend rationally the statement that
""God exists? under their favored constraint against any semblance of
univocity? I am re-reading Przywara, who provides powerful resources for this
debate-",806
"Hi Jim, you may be onto something. I think Marilyn Adams wrote a piece for an
online philosphy of religion journal about how the proof for the existence of
God requires univocity. But I""m not sure whether there is much of a
distinction between having and being being. Scotus, like every other
scholastic subscribes the Augustinian dictum that God is what he has. So we're
just back to restatements of Aquinas, such that univocity is incompatible with
divine simplicity. And given the modern mysticism you mention, we have
abandoned arguments, we simply restate positions.  
  
I came across a somewhat amusing passage just today. I was reading Nicholas
Bonetus' Metaphysics, and he accused his (unnamed, but clearly Thomist)

terms as univocal to God and creatures we predicate them in the limited and
accidental fashion we find them in the categories.  
  
I've been interested in Pryzwara for a while, but no time, alas.",998
"  
Lee,  
Thanks so much for your kind help here. I am making a case against a
distortion of Scholastic truth that is much bigger than the Newly Orthodox;
they are but its latest (and perhaps most focused) realization. The text you
cite does not deny existence to God, bu rather denies that he is an existing
individual. Thus God can be existence itself (courting various forms of
pantheism); or God may be the source of all Being, but in Himself (?) neither
a Being nor Non-being (thus invoking an Eastern God beyond Being). But I
believe Thomas would characterize God as the unique self-subsistent Being. In
particular I think Thomas allows that God is an individual. Aquinas uses
analogy to constantly say of God that He has an attribute, e.g. being an
person, or having an essence, but in a sense quite different; thus analogous;
to that of creatures. But the New Orthodoxy seems to mistrust analogy. God
they say must not be an existent entity, or he is somehow on a par with
created existent entities. So they use analogy to chase away any positive
rational affirmations of God without making any constructive use of it. Yes, a
lack (or refusal) of imagination indeed-  
  
I bought Przywara's Analogia Entis and was struck by the power of his larger
vision to incorporate both Thomist and Scotist narratives. I insist he
explicitly makes these two complementary aspects of his vision at least in a
few paragraphs. I must re-read and copy these out. I do not know of any
detailed writing of his on the harmony of Scholastic descriptions. But there
are powerful resources here for such synthesis. Not since Sylwanowicz' text on
Duns have I been so enthusiastic about a text in this specific manner. But
Przywara is deep. Later metaphysicians e.g. Fabro seem to have learned from
him, but cannot be trusted to convey what is important in him for a unified
vision.",1867
"I would like to hear more about it. When the translation came out I looked up
all the mentions of Scotus and Scotism, but they seemed way off from what such
people would say/have said. Not a misrepresentation along the Milbank-
Pickstock line, but rather a pious or positive interpretation based on a lack
of familiarity with Scotist sources.",342
"I just read Scotus' ""Concerning Metaphysics"" in the Philosophical Writings
published by Hackett. Where do Thomists get the idea that Scotus would place
God in a genus with other things. In the selection I read this afternoon it
seemed that Scotus explicitly said he didn't think that. ""Whatever pertains to
""being"", then, in so far as it remains indifferent to finite and infinte, or
as proper to the Infinite Being, does not belong to it as determined to a
genus, but prior to any such determination, and therefore as transcendental
and outside any genus."" Admittedly this is my first foray into Scotus besides
reading a few posts on this blog a couple of years ago, so I could be wrong.
Am I misreading Scotus?",712
"No, you are not misreading. Aquinas himself thinks that univocity of being
entails placing God in a genus. Thomists assume that 'univocity' is itself a
univocal term, i.e. that Aquinas and Scotus are using the same definition of
the term, and so generally assume, without reading Scotus, that Scotus puts
God in a genus. Once could speculate with more charity and say that they have
read some Scotus, such as Ord. I d. 3, where Scotus advocates univocity, but
haven't read Ord. I d. 8 q. 3, where Scotus explains why being isn't a genus
and why God isn't in a genus, and thus they assume he never addressed that
objection. When it comes to Thomists like the Radical Orthodoxy crowd, well,
they haven't read Scotus and don't care, because what they are doing is
narrative construction, and facts and details are irrelevant at best, or
simply counternarratives for reversal at worst.",881

"You know, it seems these debates have actually been going on for centuries.
Rodrigo de Arriaga (d.1667), a Jesuit philosopher who actually defends
univocity against the analogical theories of Suarez and Hurtado de Mendoza,
says that several ""recentiores"" are ""scandalized"" to hear that he has made the
""ratio entis"" univocal to God and creature. They think that he has made God
and creature equal thereby denigrating the divine majesty. He too complains
that nothing could be further from the case and that the issue only has to do
with with the 'name.' They simply ""do not hear what he wants to say."" Scotus,
it would seem, suffers the same fate. When one listens to what he actually
says, Scotus is quite fascinating.

"Indeed, Victor. It is but the current stage of the same debate. But instead of

Anonymous 2: probably the rise-fall model of the history of philosophy, Scotus
as critic of Aquinas. Not the parts where Gilson says Scotus is a revival of
platonism, since Milbank et al. make Aquinas the greatest of the platonists.
Also in general, gilson's book on Scotus, which has long been discounted in
scotist circles as ahistorical, since it is a pure comparative study of
aquinas and scotus, without any, or much, historical context (I haven't read
all of it). Gilson himself concludes that scotism and thomism are
incommensurate systems and opts for existential thomism over essentialist
scotism. Gilson's background has now been exhaustively detailed by Pomplun in
the latest issue of the Bulletin de philosophie. Honestly, he should have been
invited to the symposium as well.",975

"I have posted on Peter Thomae several times, mostly regarding his treatise
that I edited a few years ago, the Quaestiones de esse intelligibili. Now I am
finishing up his questions on being, and thought I would share a few arguments
in favor of univocity. The _De ente_ is comprised of fifteen questions and
these are roughly divided into three parts: discussion of the concept of being
(qq. 1-10), discussion of the extent of univocal predication (qq. 11-13), and
a section on the parts of being, i.e. God, the categories, finity and infinity
(qq. 14-15).  
  
Like most Scotists, Peter defends the analogy of the concept of being and
holds that the univocal concept of being is compatible with an analogical
concept of the same.  
  
First I give an argument that illustrates the systematic nature of the
treatise. Peter stitches together various conclusions that he has proven in
other questions, leaving univocity as the only surviving option.  
  
Petrus Thomae, _Quaestiones de ente_ q. 10 a. 1  
  ",1005
"> Major premise: ""Furthermore, if the concept of being is not univocal, this
> will be because [1] being does not have a proper concept, or [2] because its
> concept is denuded and despoiled from every _ratio_ , or because with
> [univocity] posited, the [3] analogy of beings [ _analogia entium_ ] and [4]
> simplicity of the first being cannot be preserved.""",360
"> Minor premise: ""But [1] does not impede from the fourth and fifth question,
> nor [2] from the ninth question, nor [3] from the seventh question, nor [4]
> from the sixth question and what follows (in the tenth question).""",224
"  
Second, I give an argument from the same section, in which Peter is showing
that the denial of univocity is impossible.  
  ",127
"> Fifth: if the concept of being is not univocal to God and a creature,
> therefore through the first principle nothing can be proved of God, which is
> unfitting. The consequence is proved thus: being [esse] is verified of every
> positive; but God is of this kind; therefore etc.",281
"> I ask in what way is 'being' [esse] taken in the major? For either it means
> the concept of created being, and then the minor is not taken under the
> major, or it means precisely the concept of uncreated being, and then the
> principle is begged [petitur principium], or it means in act the concept of
> created and uncreated being, and then there will be four terms in the
> syllogism. Therefore unless being means a proper univocal concept to created
> being and uncreated being, nothing will be able to be proven of God through
> some proposition in which being is predicated.",583

"I've been working through Peter Thomae's unpublished _De formis_ , a treatise
that like all his treatises defies assignment to a classical medieval genre.
Is it natural philosophy? Or metaphysics? It is a thorough investigation
utilizing all the knowledge about form from the middle ages. My interest in it
is partially because I am comitted to publish it as part of the general Petri
Thomae opera series, but also because of its relation, or non-relation to
Scotus. As is well known, Scotus left us no commentary or set of questions on
the _Physics_. His followers then had to fill in the gap and develop a
""scotist"" natural philosophy. Peter seems to use the available works on
Scouts, which I suppose is unsurprsing. He relies on the _De primo principio_
for the relation of matter and form, and sometimes cites Scotus' _Quaestiones
super Metaphysicam_ and Ordinatio as well. Peter Thomae also uses more Aquinas
in this work than he does in others. While elsewhere Peter has a decidedly
non-adversarial approach to Aquinas (quoting Aquinas on the primacy of the
concept of being without taking him to task over the object of the intellect),
here in the _De formis_ Peter is more critical.  
  
Sadly, the De formis survives in only 1 manuscript, that is heavily damaged,
and the scribe is the same one from the De esse intelligibili, who is an
extremely poor copyist. Thus this may well be the most challenging entry in
the Petri Thomae opera.  
  
Here is Peter's description of form from the beginning of the work, after he
has surveyed the definitions of Aristotle, Averroes, Augustine, and Avicenna.
Following the definition he breaks it down word by word in true medieval style
and offers commentary on it.

Bonaventure, others Henry of Ghent's intentional distinction, others put in
the Franciscan thought after Bonaventure such as Olivi and Peter de Trabibus.

in his so-called Quaestio de attributis in his Scriptum on the Sentences,
itself influenced by Bonaventure. Finally, Bonetus in the 1340's famously
attributes the origin to Aristotle.

Egidius of course is Giles of Rome, who, depending on the decade, is either
beloved or despised by Thomists. Thus we have a (quasi?) Thomist to add to the

###  A Fantasia on Philosophical Myth in Tarantino and Tolkien,62
"The psalmist says, ""The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom"" (Ps.
111.10, Pr. 9.10), while Aristotle says that philosophy begins in wonder (Met.
1.1). Fear and wonder meet in awe, which engenders in the soul humility in the
face of being and docility before the wise, our teachers.  
  
Quentin Tarantino illustrates this in his philosophical allegory of the soul,
_Kill Bill_. The different possible characters of the soul in its disposition
towards knowledge are pictured in the Bride and her alter ego, Elle. Although
their enmity is clearly shown from the beginning, its roots in their
contrasting characters isn't revealed until Volume 2, in the Pai Mei sequence.
The Bride approaches the kung fu master Pai Mei with a spirit of docility and
a thirst for knowledge. She submits to his discipline and learns not only
skill but wisdom, embracing her ignorance and weakness in order to overcome
it. Climbing the stairs to his sanctuary like a pilgrim, she leaves her old
life, her assumptions and worldly priorities, behind her in order to empty
herself before him. As a reward for her dedication and discipleship the master
reveals to her his deepest secrets.  
  
Her rival Elle is not a Bride, but merely a She, a woman in thrall to a male
superior but unwed (the Bride, like Elle, had been subject to Bill as his
lover and subordinate, but left him to marry a lesser man, but entering a more
honest and noble relationship of commitment and fidelity). Elle too learns
from Pai Mei; but lacking docility, she learns only skill, not wisdom. Skill
suffices to become murderous, and craft can take the place of wisdom well
enough to kill the master by treachery, after learning what she could of his
art, but she leaves him without having learned his secrets, and deprived of
one eye for her insolence. (While Odin's missing eye is a sign of what he has
sacrificed for wisdom, Elle's merely indicates her failure to learn it. So she
loses her second eye to the Bride in the same way she lost the first, left
blind and wretched.)  
  
Just before their showdown Elle reveals the Bride's true name, Beatrix Kiddo,
who only becomes blessed when she uses the virtue learned from her master, not
for gain or for revenge, but to rescue her innocent offspring, her kid, her
mother's heart. Elle on the other hand is as unfruitful as she is unwed. She
kills out of a peevish malice. She wants knowledge and power -- Pai Mei's
mastery and Hattori Hanzo's swordcraft -- but she wants to take them rather
than earn them. Elle's name shows her blankness and emptiness; the Bride's
anonymous nickname shows her fundamental difference from her rival in her
openness to conjugal fidelity and fecundity, while her true name reveals her
inner nature.  
  
(Thinking of the Bride's name leads to thinking of the actress who plays her,
Uma Thurman. She triumphs over her enemies with bloody virtue, and is last
seen leading along a pure white innocent. How can Uma here not remind us of
Una, in Spenser's _Faerie Queene_ , accompanied by her defender, the Redcross
Knight of holiness, and leading a pure white lamb? In Spenser too Una has a
counterpart lookalike, a false Una who is not a bride, conjured up with
twisted and dark skill but barren, for whom the martial strength of the knight
fought, but who in the end abandoned her.)  
  
The relation of Beatrix and Elle to the Hanzo swords (Beatrix has one made for
and given to her, while Elle wants to kill and steal from the bearer of one)
shows how they mirror the relationship between Gandalf and Saruman in _The
Lord of the Rings_. Like Saruman, Elle seeks Baconian or Cartesian domination
rather than Platonic wisdom. While Saruman wanted to either forge or steal a
ring of power to dominate others, Gandalf was given a ring of power to resist
and dismantle the domination of great powers. In the end Elle and Saruman both
are shown reduced to sheer animality and then, not utterly annihilated, but
denatured and degraded and wholly impotent.  
  
In his boast to Gandalf Saruman calls himself Saruman the Wise, Saruman Ring-
maker, Saruman of many colors. Only one of these is true, and not to his
credit. He was once wise but is no longer; he hopes to be Ring-maker but, it
appears, is not yet. He desires the Ring that is already made, and is thirsty
for ring-lore; but only in this self-given title is there any indication that
he tried to use this lore to make a ring of his own. Evidently he failed.
Furthermore, his palantir which brings him knowledge is Noldorin, his fortress
Orthanc which gives him strength and security is Numenorean: what did he make
himself? By wisdom he seems, in the end, merely to mean power, but in the
process of seeking more and more power he relied on tools which were not his
own. This is what ""science"" means in post-Baconian philosophy: not an object
of contemplation but a tool of domination, a tool we use mostly without making
or understanding ourselves.  
  
But Saruman _is_ Saruman of many colors. He means this in the sense of
appropriating all the other colors to himself, of bringing all other powers
under his own sway. But what it really means is that he has broken something:
the white light. As Gandalf tells him, ""He that breaks a thing to find out
what it is has left the path of wisdom."" Why? When you break the white light
you reveal something of its nature, but it is no longer white. Saruman's quest
for power has broken his own soul.  
  
Saruman wants a ring. Now a ring is a rigid circle rounding an empty space. A
wreath is a ring made by twisting something straight into a circle. A loop is
a non-rigid, non-enclosed ring made by coiling something non-rigid. A loop is
an interruption. A knot is a tangled loop. A labyrinth is a path looped by
bends and twists and turns. It need not be a knot; the entrance may be the
same as the exit, and may or may not have only a single path. A maze on the
other hand is a labyrinth with divergences: in it we can lose our way. There
are labyrinths in which we are confounded but not lost, because although our
sense of direction is confused there's only one path. A knot also has
(typically) only one path, but unlike a labyrinth we can't proceed along it
because the tangled loops have been drawn tight: the path, in being twisted
and then pulled, produces its own obstructions. A knot may or may not be a
closed circuit, a ring.  
  
Celtic, anglo-saxon, and norse artwork is full of knots the threads of which
are _not_ pulled tight, expanded but not unravelled. The twists and turns are
laid out so we can see what they are and follow their paths, but they are
_not_ broken. Following their paths produces contemplation, not power.  
  
Being itself has knots: it's twisted, complicated, which means literally
folded in on itself. When we're following a question down a given path and hit
an obstruction -- an _aporia_ , an impasse -- it's like slipping our fingers
along a rope and hitting a knot. The wonder of philosophy can be generated
precisely by hitting such a knot (see Joseph Owens, _The Doctrine of Being in
the Aristotelian Metaphysics_ , 216: ""the aporia of the intellect points to a
knot in the object. [Aristotle] seems to view the thing itself as somehow
binding the intellect ..."") Philosophical wonder is a sort of _amazement_ ,
being stuck in the sort of knot which is a maze drawn so tight its paths
cannot be discerned. The way to solve an aporia is to _loosen_ it, not to
untie it or to break it. Untying a knot is a de-amazement. Ariadne's thread,
which leads through the labyrinth, is an unravelled knot. It solves the
problem, but also eliminates the maze, the originating source of wonder.
Unravelling a knot completely gives us a straight line; while loosening it and
laying out its folds, open to view, transforms it first from a thing to a
maze, in which we are amazed, and then into a labyrinth of contemplation in
which thought is folded over on itself, following the path of being. When the
labyrinth has been traversed the wonder of bafflement, the amazement at an
impasse, becomes the wonder of _theoria_ , seeing the whole as a marvel.
Wonder as amazement is the beginning, wonder as marvelling (admiring, _ad-
mirare_ , to look at the thing as looking into the mirror of being) the end.  
  
We _can_ also cut through and destroy beings to replace them with beings of
our own making. We can break them to find out what they are but eliminate
their being; but this power is fraught with peril and, conjoined with the
desire for mastery, is deadly. Why is breaking a thing to find out what it is
to leave the path of wisdom? Because what it is, is one, and must be
understood as one to understand it as it is. When broken it is no longer one
and so no longer itself. The breaker may learn something from the pieces; but
not what the broken thing was. For _what_ the broken thing was was given in
its form, which is the principle of the thing's unity, its truth, its goodness
-- and of its being. The alternative to breaking is to unfold the
complications of being in thought, enough to follow its paths in
contemplation, but leaving its structure as it is. When _thumos_ is
subordinated to _nous_ , both ruling over the passions, ring-making _can_ be
licit; when desire, especially desire for power, becomes the predominant
principle, even wisdom is made wicked. True philosophy teases the loops of the
knots apart to behold their weaving, but does not presume to cut the thread.  
  
The aporia is a state of mind, but it is caused by a knot in the thing -- that
is, by somewhat in the thing's being less simple or straightforward than the
concepts I've hitherto used to conceive it. If I fail to meet, ponder, and
loosen the knot, and instead merely cut it -- dispose of it by cutting it down
to the concepts already at hand -- I have begun to replace the encounter with
reality with the concepts themselves, which leads ultimately to living and
thinking in an unreal world, the world of wraiths.",9989

passage, you would have to go to Reportatio I d. 2, ie. the first of the other
two volumes published by FIP and ed./trans. by Wolter-Bychkov.  
  
Depends on what you mean by Kosher. Few people seem to use the Wolter-Byckov
edition, but since the official critical edition may never appear, and there
are no critical reviews of Wolter-Bychkov, there are no academic grounds to
reject it.

Wolter previously published the same text with Adams in Franciscan Studies.",618
"""Culled"" might be too hasty a term. He spends a rather good chunk of time in
De Primo explaining Essential Orders and drawing 16 very important
conclusions. The argument which follows explicitly dispenses with the
Ordinatio ""actualist"" start (which gives it the feel of a cosmological
argument) and moves straightaway into the metaphysical argument for the Triple
Primacy of the First Being. He then gathers a host of attributes the First
Being necessarily possesses, including simplicity and unicity, two which are
not included in the question on whether the God does in fact exist (unicity is
proved in the very next question).  
I like to look at both the Ordinatio and De Primo proofs. They differ enough
to be interesting separate reads. For instance, the Ord version has 7 proofs
for unicity, but De Primo has only 5 and slightly altered in a place or two.

"Hello,  
  
I've been a long time silent reader of your blog and as someone interested in
medieval philosophy I find it very helpful, and though I know it may be of
less interest to you to hear, as a non-Thomist Catholic who dips his toes in
Catholic intellectual life I have found it very encouraging. So, thank you.  
You may not be surprised to hear that I've found Scotus the hardest medieval
philosopher to grasp. I think I've made some headway, but I am always looking
to fill in the gaps. I recently acquired Vos' book, but I remembered that you
have had some reservations about it. Could you tell me what about it troubled
you? Greatly appreciate it.  ",660
"Hi Adams, thanks for your comments. It is encouraging to know that the blog
does some good.  
  
As to Vos, I have not read the book all the way through, only first hundred or
two pages. My co-blogger has read it all of it, but he's probably too busy to
respond. My thoughts at the moment are more positive than they were before.
True, the book reads like a rough draft; it needed a lot of editing for style.
Plus, Vos has a very breathless writing style that can be off-putting, as if
he is more of an enthusiast than a scholar. But, working with Scotus-mss. on
the edition of Scotus' Reportatio, I have had occasion to revisit some of his
claims in the beginning and found them quite sound and astute. Even if he
massages the available evidence a bit, it turns out a lot of what he says
about Scotus life and work habits, state of Scotus' surviving works, etc. are
all quite good. I would still disagree that modality is the key to Scotus,
indeed I disagree that there is any such key at all. Scotus is a complex
thinker with a variety of positions that can be woven into a coherent whole
with some effort, but I don't think any one doctrine someone makes the rest
intelligible. Also, Vos spends almost no time at all on univocity, which i
think is a mistake given the hysteria that masquerades as theology these days.
Univocity is not a key to Scotus either, but it does render intelligible a
number of other doctrines, and if you can't get that straight odds are you
won't get the rest (for the truth of this, read anything by the Cambridge
phantasists).",1558
"I have a suspicion that Vos's emphasis on modality and de-emphasis of
univocity may result, at least in part, from his Reformed background and
heritage. Vos and his students are heavily involved in the study of post-
Reformation Reformed theology and philosophy. One interesting thing is that
the great majority of 16th and 17th century Reformed thinkers rejected
univocity, even when they were otherwise very favorable to Scotus or Suarez. I
can't help but wonder if the early Reformed appropriation of Scotis and
scotism has influenced Vos's reading of Scotus.  
  
I'm not suggesting Vos himself rejects univocity, just that perhaps the
Reformed appropriation of Scotus could be one reason for his marginalization
of the doctrine.",733
"Nathanael, you may be right, though it depends on the doctrine. Suarez-Nani
recently published an article about voluntarism in the history of philosophy,
and argued that the narratives about voluntarism ruining the world come from
the enlightenment German protestant universities. They saw Scotus' voluntarism
as a ""cesure"" in the long long of reason stretching from Plato to themselves,
and so Scotus was bad and Aquinas was good. The voluntarism=bad news theme
that we even get from Benedict XVI is thus a German protestant theme.  
  
So we could do a score card for Protestant reception of Scotus:  
  
univocity=bad  
voluntarism=bad  
modality=good.  
  
I had forgotten that section at the end of Vos' book. I am suspicious if
that's actually the case, but I haven't looked up yet.  
  
  
  ",799
"I don't think the Protestants had just one scorecard for Scotus; while the
""voluntarism is the root of all evil"" position may have emerged from German
Protestant universities in the Enlightenment there were other Protestants, at
least in the 16th and 17th centuries, who took a voluntaristic approach to
theology, for example William Twisse and Gisburtus Voetius. J. Martin Bac (a
student of Vos, I believe) has a very good book that deals with this topic,
among others, called Perfect Will Theology. I can't speak for early Lutheran
theology but I know pre-Enlightenment Reformed theology was a broad enough
movement to include both broadly Scotist approaches, broadly Thomist
approaches, and even Cartesians (though not without some rancor).",743

"> ""Despite the vast modern literature devoted to Aquinas's theory of analogy,

"I guess it depends on what she means by 'analogy.' Not much on the nature of
analogical concepts? Okay, I'll buy that. But insofar as Thomas's theology-
metaphysics concerns the asymmetrical relationship between creator and
creature, I don't see how analogy could not be an important feature of his
thought. While one won't find the expression 'analogia entis' in Thomas's
works, as McInerny complained, one will find it in his transcription of
Albertus Magnus' De div. Nom., and the theory contained there is very
formative of Thomas's early thinking. So, I'll grant Ashworth her claim, but
only because analogy is said in many ways.

"Semi-technological determinism is the more probable view. Not to sound exactly
like Marshall McLuhan or Nietzsche, but consider the following as a primary
narrative:  
  
There is a distinction between material and formal literacy. To be materially
literate is to understand the elements of language as they are given through
certain signs. To be formally literate is to be able to think about texts
theoretically and thus to bind the elements together via concepts/categories
and systems thereof. Let us say that signs refer to concepts and concepts are
either treated theoretically or referred directly to facts (concrete
particulars). Formal education does not produce natural formal literacy, but
only an artificial formal literacy which we may call conventional literacy.
Besides this, all men are materially literate as all men are constantly trying
to interpret signs in one way or another, but only to some (varying among
diverse persons) degree are they formally literate. Conventional literacy by
itself is a kind of accidental binding of the elements which is evaluated
primarily on some practical criterion. Now, let us say that most men only
obtain to to a low degree of formal literacy by nature, yet the the social and
cultural existence of formal education ensures the existence of one
conventional literacy for the generality of men. Let us say that the spread of
literacy and the gradual (and at certain points revolutionary) replacement of
a clerisy with a technical/technology-wielding class has produced this late
modern culture. As theory is subordinated to external practice, the old
'philosophical' or speculative way of thinking is aped and suppressed by
something quite different. Popular literacy and materialistic acquisitiveness
go hand in hand.

autobiography “A Path from Rome”, or perhaps in the second volume of his
autobiography “A Life in Oxford”.) In the mid to late 20th century, Belfast
was in the middle of a sectarian war, and the native Catholics, having been
brutalized and discriminated against for hundreds of years, set up their own
philosophy department at Queen’s University. The Department of Philosophy was
the protestant department, whereas The Department of Scholastic Philosophy was
the Catholic department. So the courses in The Department of Scholastic
Philosophy included Wittgenstein, Russell, and analytic philosophy in general
as well as Neo-Thomism. So you had two almost identical philosophy courses
running in parallel (but one of them had scholastic philosophy on the course.)
The departments were actually distinguished along religious lines, and the
distinction lasted well into the 80s, if not the 90s. The great Grosseteste

"That's awesome. Added to the list. It's a shame, though, that it isn't already
available within the Peter Simpson translation - that section of the
Ordinatio, that is...Oh well. More money.  
  
And Cross - who gives it a positive review...His ""The Metaphysics of the
Incarnation"" was problematic from the start, insofar as he imported
contemporary ways of speaking of substance and accidents into his discussion
of the medievals, and tried to understand the medievals through that
language/conceptualization of things - which, I would maintain, is bad form.
However, he may be right on Scotus on the Hypostatic Union, given the little
I've read - that the Word's human nature's relation to the Word in His
divinity is a doubly negative one of dependence, and such that the human
nature is a quasi-accident of the Word, with its own proper haecceitas. if
Cross is right, I simply do not see (or do not yet see) how Scotus is not an
accidental Nestorian, as I do not see how he could maintain coherently in the
face of this understanding the Word's really being human or really subsisting
in a human nature. (Yes, Lee, hint hint indeed.)  
  
Would it be repugnant to Scotus thought to hold that, in the Incarnation, the
haeceitas of the Word's human nature is that of the Godhead? My understanding
is that he holds that each nature has, in a way - or must have - its own
proper haecceitas; even so, given the very little I know adopting what I said
above seems to me prima facie to be such that it saves Scotus's Christology
from Nestorianism. But anyway, I leave this to those who know better than I to
say yea or nay and why.(And hey, if that could be maintained in light of
Scotus' metaphysics, I wonder if it may be a point at which a bridge could be
built between Thomas and Scotus.)",1788

don't address it, then I may just go ahead and write a few articles on it - if
I get into a PhD program this time around...In any event, the whole
controversy seems to have its roots in now age-old apparent opposition of
tendencies in the Church regarding the Person of Christ: the one emphasizes
the distinction of natures in the Person of Christ; the other, His unity. But
of course you know all this. Anyway, seems to me finding some way to help
Thomas and Scotus talk coherently to each other on this point would help -
maybe - bridge the apparent divide. Probably a pipe dream, but hey.

Along the lines of the last paragraph cited here, I note that there seems to
be a growing movement toward seeking compatibility between Scotist and
Molinist explanations in natural theology. I note in particular the books,
""Contingency, Time and Posssibility"", by Pascal Massie; and ""The Problem of
Divine Foreknowledge and Future Contingents from Aristotle to Suarez"" by
William Lane Craig. There is also an essay, ""Molina and John Duns Scotus"" by
Jean-Pascal Anfray.

"Didn't Mastri and Punch have an argument in the 17th century about whether
Scotism and Molinism were compatible? I seem to recall reading that Punch
thought middle knowledge was compatible with Scotism and Mastri argued it was
not. Unfortunately my Latin is not good enough to confirm this but the printed
editions of both men are available on prdl.org for those with the curiosity
and skills to look.",401
"  
Lee,  
  
I finally decided to read carefully Eef Dekker's book on ""Middle Knowledge.""  
Dekker contributed two essays to E.P. Bos' collection, titled ""John Duns
Scotus (1265-1308; Renewal of Philosophy"". The essays are, ""Does Duns Scotus
Need Molina. On Divine Knowledge and Co-Causality""; and ""Scotus' Freedom of
the Will Revisited"". All of these have been very important to me in my
struggle to reconcile divine foreknowledge and human freedom. I am convinced
that neither Molina nor the ""possible worlds"" theory are essential here - but
they are important means to the end of resolving this. I am daring to believe
I have an understanding of this. Molina had the germ of an answer, but did not
understand Duns Scotus.

favorite). But what if basic deviations happened long ago? What if European
science assimilated Thomism to a foreign Rationalist understanding several

Aquinas was a detailed clear expositor of his ideas on the Catholic faith and
Catholic philosophy; so much so that the Church recommends him pedagogically.
But somehow, even though he had many followers, his ideas were distorted into
""baroque Scholasticism"" by nominalist and Scotist influences. (But wasn't
there a succession of authentic Thomists that defended pure Thomism? There
must have been Thomists before Gilson that really understood Thomas'
writings?)",741

"The first 2015 issue of Studia Neoaristotelica offers two papers and two
reviews. Vlastimil Vohánka (Olomouc, Czech Rep.) in ""Necessary Laws? Seifert
vs. Oderberg"" addresses the thesis that no laws of nature are (metaphysically)
necessary: i.e. true in every possible world. In particular Vohanka focuses on
arguments for this thesis by Josef Seifert, a realist phenomenologian, and
David Oderberg, an analytical neo-Aristotelian and argues that, as they stand,
they are not convincing. He admits, however, that given God and his ability to
do miracles, the idea of ""meaningful"" but non-necessary connection between
essences is a better essentialist explanation of persistent regularities. This
explanation implies that no law is necessary, be it weakly or strongly.
Miroslav Hanke (Praha) in ""Analysis of Self-Reference in Martin Le Maistre's
Tractatus Consequentiarum"" presents a formal reconstruction of an analysis of
self-reference of Le Maistre, a a fifteenth century master. His approach is
based upon the principle that sentential meaning is closed under entailment,
which leads to a semantics compatible with the principle of bivalence and
classical rules of inference. The issue is concluded with a review by Michael
Sullivan of Edward Feser's Scholastic Metaphysics: A Contemporary Introduction
(Heusenstamm bei Frankfurt, 2014) and by Peter Forrest of James Franklin's An
Aristotelian Realist Philosophy of Mathematics Mathematics as the Science of
Quantity and Structure (New York, 2014)",1500

"The part about Seifert in Publisher's note is particularly interesting, since
he's done a lot to introduce realist phenomenology to my native Russia, where,
just like in many other places, the Continental quasi-philosophy reigns
supreme. While discussion is important, it is kind of sad that analytic,
realist-phenomenolgical and scholastic traditions cannot find a single voice,
despite the differences. Philosophers must not forget that wider audience
(something that was mentioned by Dr. Simpson, who's been linked here also, in
relation to Scotus), like myself, that aren't a philosophers or a scholars of
any sort but are also interested in these traditions. However, a lot of the
times we are unable to receive a holistic presentation of a wider ""realist""
viewpoint.  
  
Same can be said about the much needed debate around Feser's book. It surely
has its drawbacks but nevertheless it is a great attempt at bringing the
manualist tradition back to the public and people, who do not have the
necessary talents to be philosophers per se. Feser, it seems, heard Sullivan's
previous comments and since then got interested in Scotus a little more.
Perhaps one day they can combine their efforts and write something truly neo-
scholastic and not just neo-thomist or neo-scotist.

"This work of Scotist metaphysics is an investigation into the ultimate
constitution of things. In the course of this treatise, Petrus Thomae examines
whether the essences of things ultimately depend on being thought of by God
for their very intelligibility or whether they have it of themselves.
Defending in detail the second option, Peter argues that creatures exist
independently of the divine intellect in the divine essence. They enjoy real,
eternal being in the divine essence and objective being in the divine mind.
Aware that these views conflicted with his belief in the Christian doctrine of
creation, Peter laboured to alleviate the conflict with a theory of non-causal
dependence, according to which even if God did not cause creatures to be in
the divine essence, nevertheless they are necessary correlatives of the divine
essence.",844

Raymond Sebonde under the heading of 'Renaissance and Reformation', though he
notes that it is from the late fiftheenth century, surely part of the medieval
era. And again, Sebonde was writing a hundered years after Bonetus.",301
"So no mention of univocity of being, or Scotus' proof for the existence of
God, or the nature of metaphysics and theology. the former doctrine, as is
well known, is treated under the rubric of natural knowledge of God.",218
"One is that McGrath makes no mention of Christian Wolff, who wrote a natural
theology that was quite influential on the continent. Indeed, McGrath is
focused on the English understanding of natural theology as closely allied
with natural philosophy and the physical sciences.",275

person to write a _Theologia naturalis_ and assign it a place among the system
of sciences inherited from Aristotle. But perhaps, since this the encylopedia
is electronic, the author will update it later.",282
"In the end it makes an interesting contrast with Milbank and his school, for
whom Scotus is of cosmic catastrophic significance. For McGrath, it seems
Scotus is mainly of interest because of the poetry he inspired.",214

time. He is sympathetic to Scotist ideas, at least compared to other thomists
of his time. But he was writing before there was much scholarship on the topic
for Scotism, so he is a bit off in places.",278
"This is from the end of Add. II d. 14 q. 4. Even if William of Alnwick may be
expanding on Scotus' text (studies on the Additiones II are in their infancy,
so I don't know if there is a parallel elsewhere in Scotus yet), it shows that
ireland was already being called 'hibernia' by about 1315, close to Scotus'
lifetime.",320
"So back on the theme of where Scotus was born, namely, was he Irish (Scotus,
Hibernicus), or Scottish (Scotus). While it is commonly held today that the
Scottish position has triumphed, there was some criticism on a post from
earlier in the year to the effect that the word ""scotus"" originally meant
someone from Ireland and only later, possibly during Scotus' own time did it
come to mean someone from Scotland.  ",414
"While transcribing the _Additiones magnae_ , a text compiled by William of
Alnwick from Scotus' Oxford and Parisian teaching, I came across the following
sentence, that is obviously sketching a map of Europe and also distinguishes
between Scotland (scotia) and Ireland (hibernia).",280

"While transcribing the _Additiones magnae_ , a text compiled by William of
Alnwick from Scotus' Oxford and Parisian teaching, I came across the following
sentence, that is obviously sketching a map of Europe and also distinguishes
between Scotland (scotia) and Ireland (hibernia).",280
"So back on the theme of where Scotus was born, namely, was he Irish (Scotus,
Hibernicus), or Scottish (Scotus). While it is commonly held today that the
Scottish position has triumphed, there was some criticism on a post from
earlier in the year to the effect that the word ""scotus"" originally meant
someone from Ireland and only later, possibly during Scotus' own time did it
come to mean someone from Scotland.  ",414
"This is from the end of Add. II d. 14 q. 4. Even if William of Alnwick may be
expanding on Scotus' text (studies on the Additiones II are in their infancy,
so I don't know if there is a parallel elsewhere in Scotus yet), it shows that
ireland was already being called 'hibernia' by about 1315, close to Scotus'
lifetime.",320
"C18: the _ratio_ of being is said of being in potency and being in act (no
appeal to a _regula_ ).",98
"D30: if being taken equivocally is the subject of that principle ‘affirmation
or negation of whatever being’.",109
"Francis of Meyronnes is probably the most influential and important Scotist of
the fourteenth century. His many works survive in hundreds of manuscripts and
many were printed in the early days of the printing press. His commentary on
the _Sentences_ exists in three versions, called 'ab oriente', 'summa
simplicitas' and Conflatus. He became a master in 1323 by decree of the pope
after lecturing at Paris.",406
"C8: being is not said equivocally but univocally of the ten categories (from
“the same rules”).",95
"R10: the subject of every science is univocal to everthing about which
something is demonstrated in that science.",113
"R18: whenever something common is said of some things in a prior and posterior
way ( _per prius_ _et posterious_ ), it is not univocal to them.",143
"R2. Whenever some intellect is certain about one concept and doubful about
either of two others, that certain concept befalls both according to the same
formal notion.",167

fifteen _conclusiones_ :",101

"As for the divine will and contingency, would a good explanation of it be that
the Will by nature and in its concept is self-determining and can't have a
necessary relation to the contingent (due to only infinite goodness absolutely
determining it), and so even Pure Actuality as a substrate doesn't change
that? This also means that the Will may have a form of contingent actuality,
which isn't potentiality, which makes the idea of God possibly having chosen
differently coherent.  
  
In fact, one could even say that the relation between God and creation is an
intentional relation - a relation of the intentionality of God's acts, which
doesn't depend on creation (so it's not a real relation) but also isn't purely
a logical relation of reason. What do you think?",769

"Reposting some of my questions about ideas:  
  
1) One last thing I'm wondering about is that, if we say that the divine ideas
are closer to the divine intellect than our ideas are to our intellect because
they are an accident or changeable or could exist separately from our own
intellect, then this would seem to imply that the divine ideas are more
closely rooted and related to God than our ideas (or maybe the ideas in our
intellect are the same as the divine ideas?) are to our own minds.  
  
One could then say that even the parts of the divine ideas that aren't pure
perfections and don't simply reflect God are still rooted in God and so still
in some way reveal God to us as well - even if not as just a reflection of
God. Maybe through their own uniqueness and NON-similarity to God bringing God
glory precisely because uniqueness is God and rooted in God. What do you
think?  
  
2) This then leads to the possibility that the two aspects of a divine idea -
the pure perfections reflecting God, and the creaturely part that's unique in
itself - are not only compatible but **even complement** each other as well.  
  
Say, when God brings about the New Creation we **won't** see created beings as
nothing more than **reminders** of God like an infatuated girl seeing
everything else in the world as just a reminder of her boyfriend in different
ways - we'll also see each thing as having **a uniqueness** in it that isn't
just a reflection of God. And those two will **complement each other** and
make themselves shine - things aren't **just** reminders of God, but they also
aren't **just** purely unique things without any reflection of God either. In
some way, they need each other and fulfill each other - just as God is both
One and Many in Himself, so too are the divine ideas both reflections of God
AND unique in themselves with non-reflective content.  
  
And since God is also infinitely unique in Himself and is Goodness itself, and
having both aspects present in the content of a divine idea is good, both the
uniqueness of creatures and their similarity to God are rooted in God, and
give **greater glory** to Him.  
  
What do you think?",2166
"1) So Scotists do have a concept of individual ideas that fully incorporate
everything about the creature - which would be the divine idea, or the
particular idea as such?  
  
Haecceity would just be one of the necessary parts of the particular concept
of each divine idea?  
  
2) So could Scotists say that maybe there would be differences in God had He
decided to create different individuals, but that these differences **don't**
violate divine simplicity or immutability? The modal collapse argument is that
if nothing in God could have been otherwise because of divine simplicity, and
the intention + reasons for creating any particular creature are internal to
God, then God couldn't have refrained from creating the creatures He did, and
so the existence of this particular creation is necessary with no other
creatures actually being able to exist at all.  
  
All because the intentions + reasons for creating the particular creatures God
actually did create are internal to Him, and nothing internal to God could
have been otherwise.  
  
But if we accept the formal distinction **and** that God's will is
contingently self-determining, it seems a Scotist could conclude that there
really could be differences in God depending on at least **whether** He
decided to create, if not what particular things He created, precisely because
the Will need not have determined itself to create anything contingent, and
that this in no way violates either divine simplicity or immutability. What do
you think?  ",1512
"Mr. Given,  
  
I do agree, and I would add that Gilson, in his rush to assimilate Bergson's
natural philosophy (in lieu of Aristotle's), also misunderstands St. Thomas's
metaphysics. Gilson's is really a new metaphysics, perhaps inspired by St.
Thomas, but diverging from it in many critical ways. To correct that
misapprehension and return us to a more traditional interpretation was my
essential interest in writing the short tract. Step one for me is to free St.
Thomas from his modern shackles.  
  
My original background is materials science and electrical engineering. It was
only as I began to see the problems with modern physics that I entered deeply
into natural philosophy, and thence into metaphysics. I agree that in most
respects Scotus and Aquinas are complementary. Bettoni was my first
introduction to Scotism, and my reading of Scotus has extended only to my own
philosophical interests. I certainly cannot be called an expert in his
philosophy. However, I believe that his principal theses, understood in the
proper sense, not in the sense Thomists assign to them, are compatible with a
Thomistic framework. As a Catholic, I do not view Scotus as a suitable
standard for the Church, given the smaller range of his thought, its
abstruseness, and the confusing state of the writings he left behind. However,
I think it very important that his new insights be incorporated into a
Thomistic foundation.  
  
I too have sought a unifying viewpoint and I do believe I have found it in a
discipline I call ""Taxology,"" which I have spent the last 25 years developing.
The study of pure metaphysical order effectively works as a material logic of
the transcendentals. Its role is analogous to the role the mathematical
apparatus plays in mathematical physics, except that I use the data of
revelation and traditional metaphysics, rather than the data of the senses.
The formal distinction, haecceity, and the univocity of being all find their
taxological equivalents. If it is something that interests you, we can discuss
it offline at the email I provided. It would take us far astray of this
conversation.",2119
"A few questions about Scotism:  
  
1) About haecceity, I've read that it's supposed to be only the individuating
parts of a thing's form, not the parts it shares with other things such as its
essence. In analytical philosophy the term has also come to include the
essence as well, making the haecceity the individual idea of the creature that
includes all of its determining elements - so the universal essence is just a
part of the haecceity, rather than something strictly separate.  
  
So my question is - has any follower of Scotus supported this view of
haecceity where it's basically the individual concept of the thing, where the
essence is a part of the properties contained in the haecceity? Or is this an
opinion distinct from Scotism in general?  
  
2) Regarding God's free will, creation and divine simplicity, an objection
that's sometimes posed is that this would make the created world we have
necessary, and so God couldn't help but create this world. The reason given
for this is that if the decision to create this particular world and/or the
reasons for doing so are intrinsic to God, then they are also a necessary part
of God's being since God is simple and everything in Him is necessary, even if
they are also formally distinct. So if God had decided to create a different
world then we would have a completely different God essentially since what is
intrinsic to God would be different - and if there can be no differences in
God whatsoever, then God wasn't actually free to create this world and
creation is necessary.  
  
Would it be possible to respond to this by saying that since God's will is
free and is formally distinct from the essence along with the divine
intellect, one could say in some way that there would in fact be a difference
in God, but not one that violates divine simplicity? For example, since the
will is formally distinct from the essence, the will's acts of creation could
be different in different scenarios, but the divine essence would still remain
the same, since it's only the will that may contain the difference? Similarly,
the divine intellect which has the reasons for creating this or that world is
also formally distinct from the essence, so even if the divine intellect
presents different reasons to the will, those differences wouldn't be in the
essence formally as such?  
  
Is this an acceptable explanation under Scotism, or would the answer have to
be approached differently? What do you think?",2467
"@Garrett,  
  
  
1) Couldn't one object that an ability's power to do something still implies
potency, so the divine power would then have to be composed of act & potency?
Or that the very concept of ability as we univocally understand it contains
unactualised potentials with regards to its exercise?  
  
2) I wasn't talking about the formal distinction being incompatible with
realiter unum, but that if the act of creation itself is realiter unum in God,
then it must be necessary and can't be contingent, so the divine Will can't
have a contingent aspect internal to it since things that are realiter unum
with God can't be different than what they are.  
  
This seems to follow if we also assume that everything that is realiter unum
in God can't be otherwise - so the distinct formalities in God can't be
otherwise than how they actually are.  
  ",856
"Wesley, I would say it does not violate divine simplicity because the divine
potency in question is not a potency in being, such that the divine being is
composed of potency and act, but rather active potency, which is the ability
of a power to do something. divine simplicity only requires us to reject
passive potency, the ability to be acted upon. even Aquinas incorporates the
doctrine of active potency into his doctrine of creation. So I would qualify
the notion of 'pure actuality' as an actuality of being.  
  
As for the other objection, I would claim that formal distinction is
compatible with everything in God being realiter unum. So the formally
distinct intellect proposes a variety of essences and indivuduals to the will,
and the will chooses to actualize them. How? I would say here with Scotus,
that the will just wills, that is it's job. some things it wills necessarily,
such as the divine nature, and others contingently, creation. the same sole
divine power can have both aspects to its single act of will. In other words,
I don't think I have an answer.",1077
"I respond not to your discussion of Morris, but to your mention of struggles
with Przywara. I recall great enthusiasm when discovering his Analogia Entis;
followed by a later frustration, slower in offset. Enthusiasm for two reasons:
(1) Przywara seemed to be in the early 1930's in dialogue with many of the
creators; the shapers of twentieth century theology, including Karl Barth and
Martin Heidegger; (2) Przywara convinces one repeatedly by his formulations
that he has a larger vision of which Thomism and Scotism are complementary
aspects. Frustration because of his conciseness of his formulations. (Was he
but another in a Century of Zen Masters? No too much testimony by those we
respect that the effort here is worthwhile.) You remind me here that I must
redouble my efforts to understand Przywara. But I think one must work with a
good biography of Przywara because his importance seems to be contained in his
individual interactions - conversations; letters.  ",973

Garrett,  
  
  
Is the commentary by Antonius Andreas available online? I find a CUA PhD
thesis on this work (supervised by Timothy Noone) that looks quite
interesting; but not the work itself-",200
"@Garrett,  
  
2) Interesting - so while the Will would be inseparable from God and
necessarily exists, the contingent acts it does could have been different in
some way?  
  
The immediate objection that comes to mind is that this seems to violate Pure
Actuality - if God's will is contingent and could have acted differently,
wouldn't this imply some potentiality intrinsic to God's will in some sense?
So a contingent act of will that could have been otherwise can't be attributed
to God since it goes against PA?  
  
Another possible objection is that if the contingent act of creation is itself
realiter unum in God, then it's no longer contingent since nothing that is
realiter unum with God could have been otherwise, so God's act of creation /
decision of creating any particular thing is necessary.  
  
Now one could avoid this by saying the act of creation isn't intrinsic to God
or realiter unum with Him, but it also can't be an accident since this would
go against divine simplicity, so it must be wholly extrinsic to God. But if
the act of creation is wholly extrinsic then in what way can it even be
attributed to God, since it is no longer attributed to Him properly as
intrinsic? There would be no difference between this wholly-external model,
and creation just popping into existence uncaused - it seems God is no longer
responsible for creation's existence at all.  
  
What do you think?  ",1412
"  
Thank you very much for your guidance. I have been focused very much on Duns
Scotus' understanding of will. First, it seems both essential and very
difficult to square the Classical heritage about the Boundless and the
Infinite as complete, impassive timeless and unchanging; with the Christian
understanding of a God who loves us, answers our prayers, and feels our pain.
Jesus tells us to pray for all that we need, and that God will answer our
prayers. The New Testament makes God essentially involved with us in a way
that must be intelligible in terms of Scholastic metaphysics. Catholics seem
to favor a God who responds to our prayers and suffers with us. The Calvinist
seem to take a maximally Classical i.e. unchanging and impassive position on
this matter. Second, the question of which modifications of Scholastic
metaphysics necessary to allow for both Divine omniscience and omnipotence;
and with human free will; seem to be few in number. William Lane Craig will
argue in detail that only Scotism and Molinism have this potential. Finally, I
am deeply concerned about the efforts by present ""researchers"" to deny the
reality of human free will as pretext to destroy the open, liberal society,
which is essentially based on the ability and willingness of most citizens to
decide to obey the law and contribute to social well-being. A society of
people unable to control their actions must be a police state. A movement
which includes many senior neurophysiologists and psychiatrists, the Embodied
Mind Theory is striving to create a scientifically defensible understanding of
human free will. Several practitioners have written about this. See e.g. the
book by Guus Lebooy, ""Freedom and Dispositions."" They believe, as i do, that
Scotism allows for a modern theory of free will.  
  
My theme here: Scotist metaphysics is very important as a living accessible
strand of Western philosophy and thought. I wish I had the resources to make
an popular exposition of these ideas. The Calvinist William Lane Craig has
used Molinism to support his form of Calvinism. He writes and lectures widely
to popular audiences about his ideas. But I fear his ideas are compatible with
mainstream theories of unconscious human determinism, i.e., the ""Myth of Human
Freedom.""",2273

and also because it provides a basis for comparison of Scotist and Thomist
notions on this topic (even though Doolan is a Thomist) because it includes a
rather detailed account of the dialogue between James F. Ross, as Scotist; and
Lawrence Dewan (as Thomist) on these topics. Is there a best account of Scotus

the will. I have stayed out of this area in my professional writing, mainly
because Scotus' views on the will are contested, and there are still texts
that need to be critically edited.",495
"1\. I have never heard of a Scotist holding this. The individuating difference
is held to be formally distinct from the essence. The divine idea of a
creature might qualify, in that it would have both the essence and the
haecceity.  
  
2\. I think the idea of a possible world would be foreign to scholastic
thought. indivduals might be possible, but not worlds. on scotism, the divine
intellect generates a variety of formal rationes and essences, and their
intrinsic non repugnance determiens what is possible. But the divine will has
to actualize them. So any indivdual might not have been actualized, and
another might have been actualized that is not, but not an entire world as
such.  
  
anyway, you are correct, Scotus and his people would posit a formal
distinction between the intellect and will, so they don't have the modal
collapse problem. but it is a weaker sense of divine simplicity to be sure. On
the other hand, there is no authoritative statement of divine simplicity
anywwhere, so what does that matter? With Scotus the debate is how much
distinction does the formal distinction posit, as he has several different
formulations.",1149
"As nice a short summary of Scotus as was every written. But we might fight
against it.",86
"  
Garrett, there seem to be several distinct topics in play here.  
  
A metaphysically and theologically adequate account of Creation is a complex
and elusive goal. The identification of Creation with the physical theory of
the Big Bang is a very damaging scientistic error. In creation ex nihilo does
not mean creation from nothing in the logical sense, but creation beginning in
a state in which nothing exists except God. Divine ideas and the aether must
be real in a timeless sense. But neither one has distinct existence.  
  
The compatibility of Divine omniscience and free will is a very complex topic
addressed in detail by a number of good books. I have already noted these. The
compatibility of Molinism and Scotism, as possibly the only two accounts of
free will that preserve this compatibility, is addressed in the paper,
''Molina and John Duns Scotus'' by Jean Pascal Anfray.  
  
The Embodied Mind scientists want a neurophysiological account of mind and
brain that is compatible with human free will. But they are scientists not
philosophers and have no one to provide a metaphysical foundation for their
account. It is rather the case that most psychology is materialistic and
naturalistic, and provides no account of authentic free will. Freudianism is a
major class of examples. The physical sciences seek explanations in terms of
physical causation. The basic truth is that accounts of the brain based on the
dynamics of neurons provide no foundation or account of the basic elements of
a description of mind: thoughts, intentions, dispositions, acts of will, and
emotions. This accounts for the popularity of theories of ''quantum
consciousness,'' which seek to account for free will in terms of quantum-
mechanical indeterminacy.  
  
I have not thought systematically about the ""free will deniers."" I note there
are many books and papers supporting this. I also note that many notions in
sociology and criminology seek to prove that racist attitudes and judgments
are preconscious and present in very early life of a child. Theories that
maintain that control of either various types of sexual behavior, or of
violent behavior, and of addictive behavior; are unconscious and not subject
to will are now widespread. These theories are dangerous to a liberal, open
society. I do not maintain there is an organized 'movement' opposed to the
notion of free will. Physical science is predisposed in this manner; and
various social theorists are quite willing to exploit these theories.

At one point Scotus is trying to prove that God is intelligent, and he offers
this argument:  
  
""4.21 There is a fifth proof for this conclusion, which is based on the fact
that a living thing is better than anything not alive, and among living things
what has understanding is better than what lacks intelligence.""  
  
However, at 4.22 Scotus presents an argument that intellect, love, etc., are
pure perfections and therefore must be in God, etc. He then proceeds to refute
that argument (I'm not convinced of his refutation, btw).  
  
It seems to me like Scotus is contradicting himself here, unless I'm missing a
subtle distinction he's making. He thinks we can prove God is intelligent from
the fact that being intelligent is ""better"" than non-intelligent, but then
seems to argue against that very kind of argument in the next paragraph.  
  
I take ""better"" to refer to ""more perfect"", as in, possessing more actuality,
more power, more irreducible properties. Yet isn't that what one also argues
when speaking of pure perfections?",1138

Sorry to be presumptuous on Desmond. I have, but have not yet had occasion to

"Desmond is a scholar of continental philosophy, mainly of Hegel it seems, with
little to no interest in medieval philosophy. The book listed in the title of

Scotus. It might be on the Logic museum website, but you can get the link to t
he volume from Sidney penner's website. If you email me, I can send you an
article or two about the text.  
  
Not sure you are right about Desmond. He knows nothing at all about medieval,
at least not when he wrote the present book. He seems to grant the need for
univocity in science, but wants to avoid philosophy collapsing into math or
physics. So he starts with the aristotelian experience, the desire to know,,
but tries to intregrate univocal science with the equivocity of experience. It
may end up as mysticism, though, who knows. I have only read the first two
chapters.",732
"On the other hand, a possible response could be that the Will is by nature
self-determining, and with regards to finite creatable things logically cannot
have a necessary relation towards them.  
  
This is conceptually prior to considerations of pure actuality or whatnot, so
the definition and nature of what will is may show us how its acts are
contingent, or has a contingent element to it.  
  
Furthermore, this doesn't need to conflict with God being Purely Actual since
it's precisely God's infinite actuality that may allow for an abundance of
freedom - His Will can have contingent aspects precisely by being rooted in
pure actuality, which paradoxically implies freedom as infinite actuality
opens up towards an infinite horizon of possible being, since the infinite
maximally self-consistent God can't have a necessary relation to contingent
finite reality. As Aquinas points out, the will is related to things in their
ontology, so since contingent creation has contingent ontology, the Will can't
be related to it necessarily.  
  
What do you think of this?  ",1074

Wesley C:  
  
I think you raise a very basic question that should appear as an exercise in a
textbook on Western i.e., Christian metaphysics:  
If God is omnipotent and can do all things, why is He not characterized by
Infinite Potentiality rather than Infinite Actuality? Intuitively, a human
e.g. is a higher form of being than a rock e.g. because the former has so many
possibilities and capacities compared to the latter. And actualized
capabilities seem often to multiple possibilities, not eliminate them.

Unknown: At 4.21 Scotus argues simply from the notions of life and
intelligence to prove that God is intellective and volitive. But note, he does
not call life and intelligence 'pure perfections.  
  
At 4.22 Scotus reports a theory held by others that he then attacks. The
theory simply identifies various perfections as pure perfections conforming to
the Anselmian description. Scotus thinks it is not evident that these other
notions are all pure perfections and there is a dialogue about why he thinks
this. In the end, it seems only the attributes of being are evidently pure
perfections. So 4.21 is specifically tailored to yield the same conclusion as
if he were using pure perfections without calling them such and having to
prove that they are.",796
"Wesley,  
  
1\. Right, so a divine idea is the 'creature as known', which contains a
common nature and a haecceity.  
  
2\. on the scotist view, all divine simplicity requires is that one grant that
every thing is 'realiter unum' in God. But formal distinction is compatible
with real identity. the will is a divine attribute, and so could not not be in
God, but it acts contingently regarding creation. it could have refrained from
creating individuals or created different ones. such changes would be within
the contingent will, and even if the act might be distinct from the will, all
would be realiter unum in God. i don't think h owever, that natures could be
otherwise than they are, that is, human being be constituted in a different
way: natures are all thought up by the dvine intellect, which combines them
based on the compatibilities inherent in the nature itself. So maybe, no
goatstag.  
  
James: i have not read the Doolan book, though i have seen his articles which
look good. Scotus, of coourse, has a very differnet view of the ideas than
Aquinas. And in light of univocity, he even at one point suggests that the
divine intellect is quasi passive like ours.

since it is the principle of action, and so it is present in God. But it is
simply an ability to act, not an ability to receive action, which is the sort
of potency that would compromise divine simplicity.  
  
2\. Act of creation. well, there is just one act of will in God. Perhaps there
is an extension of the act from the initial object, the divine essence, to
other objects. A 'protensio' for the will, like there is for the intellect,
according to some. I think you may be right, in that it may be the objects
that account for the contingency, at least that the will, in its single
eternal necessary act, chose to actualize some contingent creatures.",735

"  
I have found that one must use any of the words that describe human thought or
understanding with great care in describing God. In particular, God has ideas
of individuals - but how to make sense of this using our understand of human
ideas?(Perhaps the haecceitas of an individual is better understood in terms
of God's willing of an individual, and the significance of its creation in
light of God's plan for all of creation; than in terms of God's ""idea"" of that
individual. More like willing than thinking; more like existence than essence.
But I offer these comments as aids to our understanding; as metaphysical
distinctions, they can be but formal distinctions.)  
  
Further, God has ideas for every individual He might have created. (But
there's no such thing as a nonexistent individual, one says!)I can imagine
these in the sense of undifferentiated aspects of a continuum of Divine
possibility, but in what sense are these individuals? A mathematical
continuum, e.g. a line, can be conceived formally as a set of points, but,
except for a set of measure zero, none of these points can ever be specified
using a finite-length definition or algorithm for their construction. So in
what sense are they individuals?  
  
I simply do not have here even a bare grammar of what things can sensibly be
said. I did read carefully the book, ""Aquinas on the Divine Ideas as Exemplar
Causes,"" by Gregory Doolan at CU; an excellent, very thoughtful book on these
questions. This book is to be credited with the limited understanding I have
of this difficult topic.",1565

Dear Dr. Kalb,  
There is a long tradition of pointing out that Gilson fails to grasp the basis
of Duns Scotus metaphysical position, some asserting that he interprets the
meaning of Duns Scotus' claims in the way that Aquinas might have.I'm sure you
are familiar with the history of commentaries of this kind  
  
What I find to be of crucial importance in the relation of Scotism to Thomism
is what seems to be a basic mutual incomprehension. As a theoretical
physicist, it reminds me of complementarity, i.e., the relation between the
""wave"" picture and the ""particle"" picture of matter that students of physics
must deal with.But unlike the situation in physics, there is no unified
viewpoint that accommodates these distinct pictures of Being.  
  
It is my forlorn ambition to find such a unifying viewpoint, not which
combines these two very different pictures; but rather a larger more general
viewpoint in which these two pictures can both be situated, perhaps as
endpoints of a continuum.",1001

"Regarding your other remark, I think that is what the ideas are, ideas of
creatures. thus they are contained in God, and so maybe by an extirnsic
denomination are divine, but still of themselves are purely creaturely
intelligible content. What the divine intellect does is generate essences and
pars of essences: rationality, animality, etc., and then combine them where
they are mutually compatible, attaching haecceities probably as well, and
finally the divine will actualizes the whole complex.  
  
I think positing them in the essence causes fewer problems, because then one
can avoid the apperance of change in God, and just say the creature as an
essence exists in the divine essence, and all the divine will does is
actualize it. this way, the divine essence 'shows' the creatable essences to
the divine intellect and will.  
  
varieties of these views were bandied about a lot in the 13th and ensuing
centuies and never condemned, so whether or not they are true, catholics can
hold them.",999
"@Garrett,  
  
a) Thanks for the clarification! One last thing I'm wondering about is that,
if we say that the divine ideas are closer to the divine intellect than our
ideas are to our intellect because they are an accident or changeable or could
exist separately from our own intellect, then this would seem to imply that
the divine ideas are more closely rooted and related to God than our ideas (or
maybe the ideas in our intellect are the same as the divine ideas?) are to our
own minds.  
  
b) One could then say that even the parts of the divine ideas that **aren't**
pure perfections and don't simply reflect God are still rooted in God and so
are still similar to Him in some way, even if they don't outright reflect Him.
Or that the **creaturely** part of the divine ideas which doesn't reflect God
still in some way reveals God to us as well - even if not as just a reflection
of God. What do you think?  
  
c) This then leads to the possibility that the two aspects of a divine idea -
the pure perfections reflecting God, and the creaturely part that's unique in
itself - are not only compatible but even **complement** each other as well.  
  
c) Say, when God brings about the New Creation we won't see created beings as
nothing more than reminders of God like an infatuated girl seeing everything
else in the world as just a reminder of her boyfriend in different ways -
we'll also see each thing as having a uniqueness in it that isn't just a
reflection of God. And those two will complement each other and make
themselves shine - things aren't just reminders of God, but they also aren't
just purely unique things without any reflection of God either.  
  
And since God is also infinitely unique in Himself and is Goodness itself, and
having both aspects present in the content of a divine idea is good, both the
uniqueness of creatures and their similarity to God are rooted in God, and
give greater glory to Him.

"@Garrett,  
  
Did you notice my last reply in the ""Was Scotus Irish?"" comments? About the
ideas and some other things? What do you think of it?  
  
@Lee Faber,  
  
Quick question if you have the time - where does Scotus think the ideas are
meant to be located? In the divine essence, or only in the divine intellect
which generates them?  
  
If in the divine intellect, could we extrapolate from this that creation and
created ideas aren't just solely finite reflections of God, but have a sort of
uniqueness to them as well? Since the ideas would be rooted in the intellect
but not the essence, the ideas would reflect God's intellect but not the
essence, and there would then have to be some uniqueness factor that makes the
divine ideas formally unique in themselves in their intelligible content.  
  
In other words, there is something in the divine ideas which **doesn't**
reflect God. Would this be something that's possible to say in Catholic
theology?",964
"Hi Wesley, I'll check the other thread... I am not used to getting comments.  
  
Univocity for Scotus is a property of concepts only. He says God and creatures
are one in concept but agree in no reality outside the soul.  
  
One of Scotus' early followers, Antonius Andreae, held that there was a
corresponding reality between God and creatures, and he never got into trouble
with the church, as far as I know. Mostly, it would cause problems for divine
simplicity, which was considered doctrine as of lateran IV. There must be a
reality that is common to God and creatures and one that is common, so God
will have two realities.

Byzantium and the Univocity of Being.""",117
"@Garrett, When you say it would cause problems for divine simplicity, are you
referring to Antonius Andreae's position of there being a realiy between God
and creatures, or the position that there is something in the divine ideas
that doesn't reflect God, so they aren't purely reflections of God?",297
"@Garrett, 1) Would this mean we could possibly have two formal separations
between the ideas and the essence - the essence is formally distinct from the
intellect, and the intellect is formally distinct from the ideas it generates,
so ideas would have a type of uniqueness by this two-step formal separation?  
  
2) From what you say at the end, multiple positions on this issue are
available for Catholics, and the Magisterium hasn't showed any interest in
declaring for or against any of those, so Catholics are free to believe among
them?  
  
3) Now if we accept that the ideas have purely creaturely intelligible content
that makes them truly unique in themselves, would this perhaps undo the
exemplary cause altogether? What we'd be left with is the efficient cause and
some sort of generative cause attributed to the divine intellect, and also
some relation and similarity of the ideas to God insofar as they are rooted
and generated by God.  
  
Would it be permissible to drop the exemplar cause almost completely, or even
fully? Are there any orthodox Scholastics who held such a view?  
  
4) Another important option is to say that the divine ideas are both
reflections of God that are similar to the essence in a finite way, but are
also at the same time unique in themselves or have intelligible content that
isn't purely about God? In other words, both?  
  
Or maybe even that the very unique intelligible content also reflects God in
some way at the same time?  
  
If so, this would mean the two ways of viewing the ideas could be
complementary - God is infinitely unique in Himself and is even Uniqueness
itself in a way, so it's fitting that the unique non-exemplary content of
ideas complement and be connected to the content of them that IS also
reflective of God as well. What do you think?",1814
"3\. Wesley, yes, i would say the exemplar cause is the divine idea in the
divine intellect.  
  
All theories of divine ideas are pure speculation and opinion, none of this is
at any level of defined teaching. Some might say that given the general church
recommendation of Thomas, that his views on everything are authoritative in
some sense. But not me.  
  
4\. so, yes, there would be pure perfections in common with God, maybe the
transcendental notions as they are attached to God and creatures, but the
distinctly creaturely part would be the essence plus haecceity.  
  ",577
"1\. yes. the basic condition of the formal distinction is that it obtains
between things that have formal rationes that do not contain each other. So
the formal ratio of the divine intellect would be formally distinct from the
ideas it generates (or cognizes in the essence) and the divine essence. Each
idea would indeed be its own formal ratio.  
  
2\. yes, i know of know magisterial ruling on anything pertaining to the
ideas. Peter Thomae even calls them the 'plura aeterna'. All one has to say is
that God created, the mechanism is up for grabs.  
  
3\. i think we could just identify the creatura intellecta as the exemplar
cause. God still creates by means of it. So we have the divine intellect
producing or constituting the quiddities of creatables, the divine will
choosing which ones to actualize/create. imitation is a secondary
consideration, whihc occurs when the divine intellect compares the idea to the
divine essence (the debate there is whether imitation is what constituts the
idea, Scotus says no, Thomas yes).  
  
4\. That is basically what Peter Thomae says, that the divine essence is like
an infinite intelligible mirror and the essences of creatures are reflected
and shine out of it.  
  
I would still say the ideas have to be formally distinct from God, even if
they are in God. God certainly reflects the creatures, creatures maybe
reprsesent God insofar as they have pure perfections etc. that come from God.",1443
"@Garrett, 3) So the exemplar cause would be the eternal idea of the creature
in God's intellect?  
  
Is the imitability of divine ideas (they imitate God in some way) doctrine, or
just a theological opinion? The same goes for exemplar causality - is it
doctrine, or just common opinion?  
  
  
4) So creatures represent or reflect God insofar as they have pure
perfections. Now if we say that creatures aren't just reflections of God in
their ratios, but have some unique content which doesn't reflect God as well,
would that content have to be outside the category of pure perfections?  
  
Would it be possible to say that the ratios of creatures necessarily have both
an element that reflects God AND an element that doesn't? Maybe even that they
are one and the same element, but with different aspects, one of which is
reflective of God, while the other isn't?

talk about God, or can we also say that the univocity exists in reality as

Catholic legitimately hold univocal reality in God that's not just conceptual?

A recurrent conclusion of mine in re Duns Scotus seems to me to be closely

maintained. But yes, the divine ideas are supposed to be representations of
creatures, by which God creates creatures, so they cannot be purely
reflections of God. One possibly helkpful image is that of Peter THomae, who
says the divine essence is an intelligible mirror, out of which shine/are
reflected creatures. Bonaventure posits three ways creatures exist, in
themselves, in their universals, and in their ideas in God. So the content of
the divine ideas are definitely creatures.",852

"Many thanks for highlighting this article but I honestly don't understand how
you can read it the way you have? Nearly all the 17th Irish historians list
the town in Ireland he came from, Downpatrick in Co. Down, as I believe I
pointed out. I also list three medieval sources, 14th and 15th century, that
state clearly he came from Ireland.  
  
That list that you highlight is the same one I mention in the text. Its not
decisive because Scotus could mean a person of Irish race, hence he wouldn't
necessarily be listed with the other people listed as from Ireland, if they
were Norman.  
  
Its true that its a reasonable way of reading that list to say he is Scottish
and the others are English and Irish etc, but because of the well known and
very widespread use of the word Scotus as meaning a person of the Gaelic race
in Ireland, it isn't as decisive as some make it out to be.  
  
Remember all these Latin writers are also quoting from Duns Scotus Eriugena,
and all the other long list of writers named Scotus floating around the
Medieval texts, who all were of Irish Gaelic ancestry and must have been
obviously so to these Medieval writers, so its reasonable to suppose they
meant that here as well. As I think I pointed out, I am saying you cannot be
definitive in any deductions based on that word Scotus from 1303 in my
opinion, its just used too often to mean Irishman to assume it means Scottish
in that list or any where else for that date, we need to get other facts to
settle the question, in my opinion.  
  
Anyway hopefully I have started a modern debate on the subject!",1592
"@Garrett,  
  
Also, since effects pre-exist in their causes, and creation does have to
reflect God in a sense because otherwise we wouldn't be able to ascribe any
attributes (whether analogously or univocally) to God that we also find in
creatures, could one have a middle-position on this where creatures both
reflect God AND are also unique in themselves in the sense of not just being
copies or purely reflections of God?  
  
Maybe by appealing to the idea that God is Uniqueness itself and so by
reflecting God creatures also have their own intrinsic uniqueness as well? Or
by some other line of reasoning?  
  
Of course, one could say that created ideas are individually unique in
comparison to other created ideas, but aren't in comparison to God who is the
source of ideas. But I think one possible response to that would be that since
God is infinite and created ideas aren't fully similar to God, that even in
comparison to God created ideas likely have uniqueness.  
  
What do you think?  ",1003
"Right, Scotus did not reject participation. Rather, he is interested in
working out a coherent theory of science for theology and metaphysics, which
required attention to the order of concepts. Participation isn't much use for
that.  
  
1\. I don't see why not, though i don't know of anyone who did. Probably
ockham, but I don't know that for sure.  
  
2\. I think one could this off by reference to the divine ideas. As Scotus
defines an idea, it is the 'creatura intellecta', so it is not just a bad copy
of God, the divine idea of Socrates is Socrates 'qua understood.' Or you could
just reduce participation to the depedence of a creature on its cause. every
effect depends on a cause for its existence, the same is true for creatures.  ",744
"I have two questions about participation: Some say that Scotus infamously
rejected the idea of participation in his metaphysics - though that is false -
and that participation has never been part of magisterial authority. So:  
  
1) Does this mean then that one can be a Scholastic without accepting
participation metaphysics of creation? And also, were there any Scholastics
who truly rejected participation but are orthodox?  
  
2) One potential objection to participation is that it seems to make creation
unoriginal, or devalues it by making it a copy of God's own nature, and that
rejecting participation resolves this tension - what do you think of this?  
  
Does participation make creation just a finite copy of God's own nature? Can
one still attribute originality and uniqueness to creatures even if one
accepts participation?  
  
What do you think of these?",872
"The author of the piece linked to above rejects the current scholarly view
that Scotus was Scotish. The problem is, the Irish thesis is based purely on
hearsay. There is no positive evidence in the form of a medieval document.",226
"@Garrett, So it's perfectly compatible with Catholic theology to believe that
the divine ideas are outside the divine essence, and so have a certain
uniqueness to them making them not solely reflections of God?  
  
Is that correct?  
  ",237
"On the Thomistic view, as well as some independents after Aquinas, a divine
idea is just God knowing that the divine essence can be imitated in a certain
way. They are relations of imitability. Now Aquinas still claims God knows
creatures, has providence, etc., but the point is divine knowledge of
creatures happens by means of these imitatibility relations. Scotus claimed
the divine intellect generated various parts of essences and everything that
was not repugant could be joined, and among this latter class, the divine will
actualized some ideas to exist. He also says the divine ideas are primarily of
haecceities. On this view, the divine ideas would all be internal to the
divine intellect and will and not in the essence, so there would not be a
problem with divine simplicity. In other passages, however, he posits them in
the divine essence as representations that are formally distinct from each
other and from the divine essence.",944
"@Garrett,  
  
Could you elaborate a bit more about creatura intellecta and not being a copy?
I think it sounds interesting.  
  
  ",132
"But whether or not such a distinction is true or not, it isn't relevant to the
question of Scotus' origins. For we have a contemporary document that contains
enough evidence to show Scotus' Scottish ancestry. This is the adhesion list
of 1303. In the dispute between the pope and the king of France, the king sent
officials to the various religious houses at the university and had them affix
their names to a list accepting the king's claims or denying them. Scotus is
on the list denying. The most recent edition of this list is in Courtenay.",544
"This list describes people from England as 'de anglia,' those from Ireland as
'de hymbernia', leaving 'Scotus' to be Scottish. What is more, the list
organizes people by regions: thus, on the page on which Scotus appears, we
have scholars from the Iberian peninsula, followed by Scotus, the English, the
Irish, and then the beginning of the Germans.",349
"1) Well if they are outside the essence formally, they would only be contained
in the essence in the sense that the they aren't separable from God.  
  
Now you do say that the divine ideas of creatures can't be purely reflections
of God because they of creatures, and so their content is of creatures, but
couldn't one object by saying that though the ideas are about creatures, what
they ultimately are (their very content) just is finite reflections of God
since they are rooted in God, and each creature is just a different way of
reflecting God and nothing more?  
  
One can then imagine us seeing God in the New Creation, and so seeing all the
creatures in creation as just different reminders and reflections of God -
maybe like a young girl who's fallen in love with her boyfriend so much that
everything else has become just a different reminder of him. But this seems a
disappointing state of affairs, and so it seems fitting to say that the divine
ideas aren't just finite reflections of God, but have unique content in
themselves as well.  
  
  
2) Another way I saw of putting the idea of divine ideas being unique is from
Lossky, who complains in his Mystical Theology of the East that the West makes
creation just a poor copy of God and not unique because it includes the ideas
in the essence - in fact, I originally came across this whole issue of
uniqueness by reading him. He basically claims that they aren't the eternal
reasons of God contained within the very being of God or His essence - they
aren't just determinations of the essence to which creatures refer as to their
exemplary cause. So they aren't located in the essence, but are separated from
the essence and are instead in that which is after the essence - the will,
which determines the different modes of participating in God's creative
activity. Lossky then says that one of the supposed consequences of this would
be that the ideas are no longer necessary determinations of God's nature or
part of the intelligible content of the divine being.  
  
Now Lossky does tend to misunderstand Western theology, and his understanding
of divine simplicity may also be suspect insofar as it's neo-Palamite, but
could this sort of view Lossky describes become compatible with Catholic
theology?  
  
Another thing is the issue of exemplar causality, so I wonder how placing the
divine ideas formally outside the essence, and giving them uniqueness in the
sense that they aren't purely reflections of God due to their content being of
creatures, would work here.  
  
What do you think? This doesn't just apply to Lossky's view of uniqueness, but
also to what you described as well - would this eliminate all exemplary
causality for creatures? Or would we have a both/and situation where creatures
are both reflections of God but also unique in themselves - being both
exemplars and also unique things in their own right, so they aren't reducible
to the former?  ",2940

Duns Scotus is missing in the parish.  
May 29, 2021  
Scandal at my parish  
I affirm the Athanasius Creed (Whoever desires to be saved should above all
hold to the catholic faith.Anyone who does not keep it whole and unbroken will
doubtless perish eternally...)in the parish but the priests and many of the
parishioners do not do the same.  
I live in the parish, Santa Maria di Nazareth, Casalotti, Boccea.It is a
20-minute drive from Rome's Battistini Metro Station.How can they offer/attend
Holy Mass and not affirm the infallible teaching of the Athanasius Creed?  
I affirm Vatican Council II interpreted rationally in the parish but the
priests and most of the parishioners do not do so.  
For me LG 8, LG 14, LG 16, UR 3, NA 2, GS 22 etc are practical exceptions for
the Athanasius Creed. In other words, they refer to known non Catholics saved
outside the Church. They refer to physically visible people saved without
faith and the baptism of water.Invisible and unknown people cannot be
exceptions to the Creed. So with this irrationality they make the Athanasius
Creed obsolete.  
My interpretation of Vatican Council II is rational and traditional.It is not
a break with the Creeds.  
  
How can the priests and people offer/attend Holy Mass with an irrational
interpretation of Vatican Council II etc ?  
When the priests and people in the parish do not affirm the Athanasius Creed
and Vatican Council II, do they no have to go for the Sacrament of Confession,
end the scandal and correct themselves in public ?  
For me the baptism of desire(BOD) and being saved in invincible ignorance(I.I)
refer to hypothetical and theoretical cases only. I cannot meet or see someone
saved as such.It is only God who can know if someone is saved with BOD and
I.I. So there are no practical cases of BOD and I.I for me.There are also no
practical exceptions to the past Magisterial ecclesiocentrism of the Catholic
Church.  
But with visible for them,BOD and I.I, the priests and catechists and others
in the parish, reject the strict interpretation of the dogma extra ecclesiam
nulla salus(EENS).  
They change the interpretation of Vatican Council II.Since for them, LG 8, LG
14, LG 16, UR 3, etc contradict the dogma EENS. There are practical exceptions
for them.  
So they have rejected the dogma EENS and the Athanasius Creed which says
outside the Church there is no salvation.  
  
They have changed the meaning of the Nicene Creed. It is "" I believe in three
or more known baptisms for the forgiveness of sins and they exclude the
baptism of water in the Catholic Church( so EENS is rejected)"".  
They have changed the meaning of the Apostles Creed. It is "" I believe in the
Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church,'which teaches the Catholic Church today
that there is known salvation outside the Church and so the Creeds and
Catechisms are obsolete in their old understanding"".  
They have changed the meaning of the First Commandment which now indicates for
them that outside the Catholic Church there is known salvation and so there is
true worship in non Christian religions.  
This is public heresy, scandal and schism and Holy Mass is offered/ attended,
by all in the parish.  
This scandal has to be rectified in public, before absolution is given in the
Confessional.-lionel Andrades

"Reposting some of my questions about ideas:  
  
1) One last thing I'm wondering about is that, if we say that the divine ideas
are closer to the divine intellect than our ideas are to our intellect because
they are an accident or changeable or could exist separately from our own
intellect, then this would seem to imply that the divine ideas are more
closely rooted and related to God than our ideas (or maybe the ideas in our
intellect are the same as the divine ideas?) are to our own minds.  
  
One could then say that even the parts of the divine ideas that aren't pure
perfections and don't simply reflect God are still rooted in God and so still
in some way reveal God to us as well - even if not as just a reflection of
God. Maybe through their own uniqueness and NON-similarity to God bringing God
glory precisely because uniqueness is God and rooted in God. What do you
think?  
  
2) This then leads to the possibility that the two aspects of a divine idea -
the pure perfections reflecting God, and the creaturely part that's unique in
itself - are not only compatible but **even complement** each other as well.  
  
Say, when God brings about the New Creation we **won't** see created beings as
nothing more than **reminders** of God like an infatuated girl seeing
everything else in the world as just a reminder of her boyfriend in different
ways - we'll also see each thing as having **a uniqueness** in it that isn't
just a reflection of God. And those two will **complement each other** and
make themselves shine - things aren't **just** reminders of God, but they also
aren't **just** purely unique things without any reflection of God either. In
some way, they need each other and fulfill each other - just as God is both
One and Many in Himself, so too are the divine ideas both reflections of God
AND unique in themselves with non-reflective content.  
  
And since God is also infinitely unique in Himself and is Goodness itself, and
having both aspects present in the content of a divine idea is good, both the
uniqueness of creatures and their similarity to God are rooted in God, and
give **greater glory** to Him.

"As for the divine will and contingency, would a good explanation of it be that
the Will by nature and in its concept is self-determining and can't have a
necessary relation to the contingent (due to only infinite goodness absolutely
determining it), and so even Pure Actuality as a substrate doesn't change
that? This also means that the Will may have a form of contingent actuality,
which isn't potentiality, which makes the idea of God possibly having chosen
differently coherent.  
  
In fact, one could even say that the relation between God and creation is an
intentional relation - a relation of the intentionality of God's acts, which
doesn't depend on creation (so it's not a real relation) but also isn't purely
a logical relation of reason. What do you think?",769

The Desmond quote seems to claim him as another Existential Thomist, i.e.,
those that believe in the primacy of the experience of Being. Descartes

In either case, an essential subjective experience. This is Neoplatonist

the will. I have stayed out of this area in my professional writing, mainly
because Scotus' views on the will are contested, and there are still texts

"Wesley,  
  
1\. Right, so a divine idea is the 'creature as known', which contains a
common nature and a haecceity.  
  
2\. on the scotist view, all divine simplicity requires is that one grant that
every thing is 'realiter unum' in God. But formal distinction is compatible
with real identity. the will is a divine attribute, and so could not not be in
God, but it acts contingently regarding creation. it could have refrained from
creating individuals or created different ones. such changes would be within
the contingent will, and even if the act might be distinct from the will, all
would be realiter unum in God. i don't think h owever, that natures could be
otherwise than they are, that is, human being be constituted in a different
way: natures are all thought up by the dvine intellect, which combines them
based on the compatibilities inherent in the nature itself. So maybe, no
goatstag.  
  
James: i have not read the Doolan book, though i have seen his articles which
look good. Scotus, of coourse, has a very differnet view of the ideas than
Aquinas. And in light of univocity, he even at one point suggests that the
divine intellect is quasi passive like ours.  
  
Thanks for the book search engine. I have used it already. Not quite the home
run on this particular book, though, since i live abroad shipping prices often
make the cheap deal not so cheap in the end.",1386
"Wesley, I would say it does not violate divine simplicity because the divine
potency in question is not a potency in being, such that the divine being is
composed of potency and act, but rather active potency, which is the ability
of a power to do something. divine simplicity only requires us to reject
passive potency, the ability to be acted upon. even Aquinas incorporates the
doctrine of active potency into his doctrine of creation. So I would qualify
the notion of 'pure actuality' as an actuality of being.  
  
As for the other objection, I would claim that formal distinction is
compatible with everything in God being realiter unum. So the formally
distinct intellect proposes a variety of essences and indivuduals to the will,
and the will chooses to actualize them. How? I would say here with Scotus,
that the will just wills, that is it's job. some things it wills necessarily,
such as the divine nature, and others contingently, creation. the same sole
divine power can have both aspects to its single act of will. In other words,
I don't think I have an answer.",1077
"1) So Scotists do have a concept of individual ideas that fully incorporate
everything about the creature - which would be the divine idea, or the
particular idea as such?  
  
Haecceity would just be one of the necessary parts of the particular concept
of each divine idea?  
  
2) So could Scotists say that maybe there would be differences in God had He
decided to create different individuals, but that these differences **don't**
violate divine simplicity or immutability? The modal collapse argument is that
if nothing in God could have been otherwise because of divine simplicity, and
the intention + reasons for creating any particular creature are internal to
God, then God couldn't have refrained from creating the creatures He did, and
so the existence of this particular creation is necessary with no other
creatures actually being able to exist at all.  
  
All because the intentions + reasons for creating the particular creatures God
actually did create are internal to Him, and nothing internal to God could
have been otherwise.  
  
But if we accept the formal distinction **and** that God's will is
contingently self-determining, it seems a Scotist could conclude that there
really could be differences in God depending on at least **whether** He
decided to create, if not what particular things He created, precisely because
the Will need not have determined itself to create anything contingent, and
that this in no way violates either divine simplicity or immutability. What do
you think?  ",1512
"  
  
I should have included Divine Ideas as a separate category, because it is so
central to these other ideas; and so problematic a concept. I favor Gregory
Doolan's book, ''Aquinas on the Divine Ideas As Exemplar Causes'' on this
topic, both because it gives the best account of the subject I have ever seen;
and also because it provides a basis for comparison of Scotist and Thomist
notions on this topic (even though Doolan is a Thomist) because it includes a
rather detailed account of the dialogue between James F. Ross, as Scotist; and
Lawrence Dewan (as Thomist) on these topics. Is there a best account of Scotus
on the Divine Ideas?",643
"  
Garrett, there seem to be several distinct topics in play here.  
  
A metaphysically and theologically adequate account of Creation is a complex
and elusive goal. The identification of Creation with the physical theory of
the Big Bang is a very damaging scientistic error. In creation ex nihilo does
not mean creation from nothing in the logical sense, but creation beginning in
a state in which nothing exists except God. Divine ideas and the aether must
be real in a timeless sense. But neither one has distinct existence.  
  
The compatibility of Divine omniscience and free will is a very complex topic
addressed in detail by a number of good books. I have already noted these. The
compatibility of Molinism and Scotism, as possibly the only two accounts of
free will that preserve this compatibility, is addressed in the paper,
''Molina and John Duns Scotus'' by Jean Pascal Anfray.  
  
The Embodied Mind scientists want a neurophysiological account of mind and
brain that is compatible with human free will. But they are scientists not
philosophers and have no one to provide a metaphysical foundation for their
account. It is rather the case that most psychology is materialistic and
naturalistic, and provides no account of authentic free will. Freudianism is a
major class of examples. The physical sciences seek explanations in terms of
physical causation. The basic truth is that accounts of the brain based on the
dynamics of neurons provide no foundation or account of the basic elements of
a description of mind: thoughts, intentions, dispositions, acts of will, and
emotions. This accounts for the popularity of theories of ''quantum
consciousness,'' which seek to account for free will in terms of quantum-
mechanical indeterminacy.  
  
I have not thought systematically about the ""free will deniers."" I note there
are many books and papers supporting this. I also note that many notions in
sociology and criminology seek to prove that racist attitudes and judgments
are preconscious and present in very early life of a child. Theories that
maintain that control of either various types of sexual behavior, or of
violent behavior, and of addictive behavior; are unconscious and not subject
to will are now widespread. These theories are dangerous to a liberal, open
society. I do not maintain there is an organized 'movement' opposed to the
notion of free will. Physical science is predisposed in this manner; and
various social theorists are quite willing to exploit these theories.

"Mr. Kalb, have you looked at any of the attempts to synthesize Scotus and
abstract his ideas for a broader audience? I am thinking here of Antonius
Andreas, who composed a commentary on the Metaphysics that had a literal
section, taken from Aquinas' literal commentary, and a question commentary,
which paraphrased Scotus' QQ on the Metaphysics.",345
"  
Dear Dr. Kalb,  
There is a long tradition of pointing out that Gilson fails to grasp the basis
of Duns Scotus metaphysical position, some asserting that he interprets the
meaning of Duns Scotus' claims in the way that Aquinas might have.I'm sure you
are familiar with the history of commentaries of this kind  
  
What I find to be of crucial importance in the relation of Scotism to Thomism
is what seems to be a basic mutual incomprehension. As a theoretical
physicist, it reminds me of complementarity, i.e., the relation between the
""wave"" picture and the ""particle"" picture of matter that students of physics
must deal with.But unlike the situation in physics, there is no unified
viewpoint that accommodates these distinct pictures of Being.  
  
It is my forlorn ambition to find such a unifying viewpoint, not which
combines these two very different pictures; but rather a larger more general
viewpoint in which these two pictures can both be situated, perhaps as
endpoints of a continuum.",1001
"Mr. Given,  
  
I do agree, and I would add that Gilson, in his rush to assimilate Bergson's
natural philosophy (in lieu of Aristotle's), also misunderstands St. Thomas's
metaphysics. Gilson's is really a new metaphysics, perhaps inspired by St.
Thomas, but diverging from it in many critical ways. To correct that
misapprehension and return us to a more traditional interpretation was my
essential interest in writing the short tract. Step one for me is to free St.
Thomas from his modern shackles.  
  
My original background is materials science and electrical engineering. It was
only as I began to see the problems with modern physics that I entered deeply
into natural philosophy, and thence into metaphysics. I agree that in most
respects Scotus and Aquinas are complementary. Bettoni was my first
introduction to Scotism, and my reading of Scotus has extended only to my own
philosophical interests. I certainly cannot be called an expert in his
philosophy. However, I believe that his principal theses, understood in the
proper sense, not in the sense Thomists assign to them, are compatible with a
Thomistic framework. As a Catholic, I do not view Scotus as a suitable
standard for the Church, given the smaller range of his thought, its
abstruseness, and the confusing state of the writings he left behind. However,
I think it very important that his new insights be incorporated into a
Thomistic foundation.  
  
I too have sought a unifying viewpoint and I do believe I have found it in a
discipline I call ""Taxology,"" which I have spent the last 25 years developing.
The study of pure metaphysical order effectively works as a material logic of
the transcendentals. Its role is analogous to the role the mathematical
apparatus plays in mathematical physics, except that I use the data of
revelation and traditional metaphysics, rather than the data of the senses.
The formal distinction, haecceity, and the univocity of being all find their
taxological equivalents. If it is something that interests you, we can discuss
it offline at the email I provided. It would take us far astray of this
conversation.",2119
"On the other hand, a possible response could be that the Will is by nature
self-determining, and with regards to finite creatable things logically cannot
have a necessary relation towards them.  
  
This is conceptually prior to considerations of pure actuality or whatnot, so
the definition and nature of what will is may show us how its acts are
contingent, or has a contingent element to it.  
  
Furthermore, this doesn't need to conflict with God being Purely Actual since
it's precisely God's infinite actuality that may allow for an abundance of
freedom - His Will can have contingent aspects precisely by being rooted in
pure actuality, which paradoxically implies freedom as infinite actuality
opens up towards an infinite horizon of possible being, since the infinite
maximally self-consistent God can't have a necessary relation to contingent
finite reality. As Aquinas points out, the will is related to things in their
ontology, so since contingent creation has contingent ontology, the Will can't
be related to it necessarily.  
  
What do you think of this?  ",1074
"The author, though not possessing knowledge of Scotus' position on univocity,
effectively rules out Scotus' position at the very beginning. p. 3:",145
"1\. I have never heard of a Scotist holding this. The individuating difference
is held to be formally distinct from the essence. The divine idea of a
creature might qualify, in that it would have both the essence and the
haecceity.  
  
2\. I think the idea of a possible world would be foreign to scholastic
thought. indivduals might be possible, but not worlds. on scotism, the divine
intellect generates a variety of formal rationes and essences, and their
intrinsic non repugnance determiens what is possible. But the divine will has
to actualize them. So any indivdual might not have been actualized, and
another might have been actualized that is not, but not an entire world as
such.  
  
anyway, you are correct, Scotus and his people would posit a formal
distinction between the intellect and will, so they don't have the modal
collapse problem. but it is a weaker sense of divine simplicity to be sure. On
the other hand, there is no authoritative statement of divine simplicity
anywwhere, so what does that matter? With Scotus the debate is how much
distinction does the formal distinction posit, as he has several different
formulations.",1149

"James: thanks for the recommendation!  
  
Unknown: At 4.21 Scotus argues simply from the notions of life and
intelligence to prove that God is intellective and volitive. But note, he does
not call life and intelligence 'pure perfections.  
  
At 4.22 Scotus reports a theory held by others that he then attacks. The
theory simply identifies various perfections as pure perfections conforming to
the Anselmian description. Scotus thinks it is not evident that these other
notions are all pure perfections and there is a dialogue about why he thinks
this. In the end, it seems only the attributes of being are evidently pure
perfections. So 4.21 is specifically tailored to yield the same conclusion as
if he were using pure perfections without calling them such and having to
prove that they are.",796
"@Garrett,  
  
2) Interesting - so while the Will would be inseparable from God and
necessarily exists, the contingent acts it does could have been different in
some way?  
  
The immediate objection that comes to mind is that this seems to violate Pure
Actuality - if God's will is contingent and could have acted differently,
wouldn't this imply some potentiality intrinsic to God's will in some sense?
So a contingent act of will that could have been otherwise can't be attributed
to God since it goes against PA?  
  
Another possible objection is that if the contingent act of creation is itself
realiter unum in God, then it's no longer contingent since nothing that is
realiter unum with God could have been otherwise, so God's act of creation /
decision of creating any particular thing is necessary.  
  
Now one could avoid this by saying the act of creation isn't intrinsic to God
or realiter unum with Him, but it also can't be an accident since this would
go against divine simplicity, so it must be wholly extrinsic to God. But if
the act of creation is wholly extrinsic then in what way can it even be
attributed to God, since it is no longer attributed to Him properly as
intrinsic? There would be no difference between this wholly-external model,
and creation just popping into existence uncaused - it seems God is no longer
responsible for creation's existence at all.

"Can someone help me with a few questions about Scotus's arguments in ""De Primo
Principio""?  
  
At one point Scotus is trying to prove that God is intelligent, and he offers
this argument:  
  
""4.21 There is a fifth proof for this conclusion, which is based on the fact
that a living thing is better than anything not alive, and among living things
what has understanding is better than what lacks intelligence.""  
  
However, at 4.22 Scotus presents an argument that intellect, love, etc., are
pure perfections and therefore must be in God, etc. He then proceeds to refute
that argument (I'm not convinced of his refutation, btw).  
  
It seems to me like Scotus is contradicting himself here, unless I'm missing a
subtle distinction he's making. He thinks we can prove God is intelligent from
the fact that being intelligent is ""better"" than non-intelligent, but then
seems to argue against that very kind of argument in the next paragraph.  
  
I take ""better"" to refer to ""more perfect"", as in, possessing more actuality,
more power, more irreducible properties. Yet isn't that what one also argues
when speaking of pure perfections?",1138
"Wesley, as to 1., Aquinas at least thinks active potency is related to action,
since it is the principle of action, and so it is present in God. But it is
simply an ability to act, not an ability to receive action, which is the sort
of potency that would compromise divine simplicity.  
  
2\. Act of creation. well, there is just one act of will in God. Perhaps there
is an extension of the act from the initial object, the divine essence, to
other objects. A 'protensio' for the will, like there is for the intellect,
according to some. I think you may be right, in that it may be the objects
that account for the contingency, at least that the will, in its single
eternal necessary act, chose to actualize some contingent creatures.",735
"  
I have found that one must use any of the words that describe human thought or
understanding with great care in describing God. In particular, God has ideas
of individuals - but how to make sense of this using our understand of human
ideas?(Perhaps the haecceitas of an individual is better understood in terms
of God's willing of an individual, and the significance of its creation in
light of God's plan for all of creation; than in terms of God's ""idea"" of that
individual. More like willing than thinking; more like existence than essence.
But I offer these comments as aids to our understanding; as metaphysical
distinctions, they can be but formal distinctions.)  
  
Further, God has ideas for every individual He might have created. (But
there's no such thing as a nonexistent individual, one says!)I can imagine
these in the sense of undifferentiated aspects of a continuum of Divine
possibility, but in what sense are these individuals? A mathematical
continuum, e.g. a line, can be conceived formally as a set of points, but,
except for a set of measure zero, none of these points can ever be specified
using a finite-length definition or algorithm for their construction. So in
what sense are they individuals?  
  
I simply do not have here even a bare grammar of what things can sensibly be
said. I did read carefully the book, ""Aquinas on the Divine Ideas as Exemplar
Causes,"" by Gregory Doolan at CU; an excellent, very thoughtful book on these
questions. This book is to be credited with the limited understanding I have
of this difficult topic.",1565
"@Garrett  
I confess that I have not looked at these works. My current state in life does
not give me the leisure to do that kind of research into secondary sources, so
I will always be a bit out of the loop on current controversies. Truth be
told, my primary interest is not really the synthesis of Aquinas and Scotus.
For me, that is simply the outcome of the convertibility of being and order. I
approach metaphysics in a very different way than either philosopher, though I
interpret and regulate my speculation in terms of their theses.",541
"  
Wesley C:  
  
I think you raise a very basic question that should appear as an exercise in a
textbook on Western i.e., Christian metaphysics:  
If God is omnipotent and can do all things, why is He not characterized by
Infinite Potentiality rather than Infinite Actuality? Intuitively, a human
e.g. is a higher form of being than a rock e.g. because the former has so many
possibilities and capacities compared to the latter. And actualized
capabilities seem often to multiple possibilities, not eliminate them.

1) About haecceity, I've read that it's supposed to be only the individuating
parts of a thing's form, not the parts it shares with other things such as its
essence. In analytical philosophy the term has also come to include the
essence as well, making the haecceity the individual idea of the creature that
includes all of its determining elements - so the universal essence is just a
part of the haecceity, rather than something strictly separate.  
  
So my question is - has any follower of Scotus supported this view of
haecceity where it's basically the individual concept of the thing, where the
essence is a part of the properties contained in the haecceity? Or is this an
opinion distinct from Scotism in general?  
  
2) Regarding God's free will, creation and divine simplicity, an objection
that's sometimes posed is that this would make the created world we have
necessary, and so God couldn't help but create this world. The reason given
for this is that if the decision to create this particular world and/or the
reasons for doing so are intrinsic to God, then they are also a necessary part
of God's being since God is simple and everything in Him is necessary, even if
they are also formally distinct. So if God had decided to create a different
world then we would have a completely different God essentially since what is
intrinsic to God would be different - and if there can be no differences in
God whatsoever, then God wasn't actually free to create this world and
creation is necessary.  
  
Would it be possible to respond to this by saying that since God's will is
free and is formally distinct from the essence along with the divine
intellect, one could say in some way that there would in fact be a difference
in God, but not one that violates divine simplicity? For example, since the
will is formally distinct from the essence, the will's acts of creation could
be different in different scenarios, but the divine essence would still remain
the same, since it's only the will that may contain the difference? Similarly,
the divine intellect which has the reasons for creating this or that world is
also formally distinct from the essence, so even if the divine intellect
presents different reasons to the will, those differences wouldn't be in the
essence formally as such?  
  
Is this an acceptable explanation under Scotism, or would the answer have to
be approached differently? What do you think?",2467
"James: the Antonius is available in vol. 5 or 6 of the Vives edition of
Scotus. It might be on the Logic museum website, but you can get the link to t
he volume from Sidney penner's website. If you email me, I can send you an
article or two about the text.  
  
Not sure you are right about Desmond. He knows nothing at all about medieval,
at least not when he wrote the present book. He seems to grant the need for
univocity in science, but wants to avoid philosophy collapsing into math or
physics. So he starts with the aristotelian experience, the desire to know,,
but tries to intregrate univocal science with the equivocity of experience. It
may end up as mysticism, though, who knows. I have only read the first two
chapters.",732

Is the commentary by Antonius Andreas available online? I find a CUA PhD

interesting; but not the work itself-",200
"@Garrett,  
  
  
1) Couldn't one object that an ability's power to do something still implies
potency, so the divine power would then have to be composed of act & potency?
Or that the very concept of ability as we univocally understand it contains
unactualised potentials with regards to its exercise?  
  
2) I wasn't talking about the formal distinction being incompatible with
realiter unum, but that if the act of creation itself is realiter unum in God,
then it must be necessary and can't be contingent, so the divine Will can't
have a contingent aspect internal to it since things that are realiter unum
with God can't be different than what they are.  
  
This seems to follow if we also assume that everything that is realiter unum
in God can't be otherwise - so the distinct formalities in God can't be
otherwise than how they actually are.

Thank you very much for your guidance. I have been focused very much on Duns
Scotus' understanding of will. First, it seems both essential and very
difficult to square the Classical heritage about the Boundless and the
Infinite as complete, impassive timeless and unchanging; with the Christian
understanding of a God who loves us, answers our prayers, and feels our pain.
Jesus tells us to pray for all that we need, and that God will answer our
prayers. The New Testament makes God essentially involved with us in a way
that must be intelligible in terms of Scholastic metaphysics. Catholics seem
to favor a God who responds to our prayers and suffers with us. The Calvinist
seem to take a maximally Classical i.e. unchanging and impassive position on
this matter. Second, the question of which modifications of Scholastic
metaphysics necessary to allow for both Divine omniscience and omnipotence;
and with human free will; seem to be few in number. William Lane Craig will
argue in detail that only Scotism and Molinism have this potential. Finally, I
am deeply concerned about the efforts by present ""researchers"" to deny the
reality of human free will as pretext to destroy the open, liberal society,
which is essentially based on the ability and willingness of most citizens to
decide to obey the law and contribute to social well-being. A society of
people unable to control their actions must be a police state. A movement
which includes many senior neurophysiologists and psychiatrists, the Embodied
Mind Theory is striving to create a scientifically defensible understanding of
human free will. Several practitioners have written about this. See e.g. the
book by Guus Lebooy, ""Freedom and Dispositions."" They believe, as i do, that
Scotism allows for a modern theory of free will.  
  
My theme here: Scotist metaphysics is very important as a living accessible
strand of Western philosophy and thought. I wish I had the resources to make
an popular exposition of these ideas. The Calvinist William Lane Craig has
used Molinism to support his form of Calvinism. He writes and lectures widely
to popular audiences about his ideas. But I fear his ideas are compatible with
mainstream theories of unconscious human determinism, i.e., the ""Myth of Human
Freedom.""",2273

Sorry to be presumptuous on Desmond. I have, but have not yet had occasion to

Knowledge.",380
"I respond not to your discussion of Morris, but to your mention of struggles
with Przywara. I recall great enthusiasm when discovering his Analogia Entis;
followed by a later frustration, slower in offset. Enthusiasm for two reasons:
(1) Przywara seemed to be in the early 1930's in dialogue with many of the
creators; the shapers of twentieth century theology, including Karl Barth and
Martin Heidegger; (2) Przywara convinces one repeatedly by his formulations
that he has a larger vision of which Thomism and Scotism are complementary
aspects. Frustration because of his conciseness of his formulations. (Was he
but another in a Century of Zen Masters? No too much testimony by those we
respect that the effort here is worthwhile.) You remind me here that I must
redouble my efforts to understand Przywara. But I think one must work with a
good biography of Przywara because his importance seems to be contained in his
individual interactions - conversations; letters.  ",973

"Regarding your other remark, I think that is what the ideas are, ideas of
creatures. thus they are contained in God, and so maybe by an extirnsic
denomination are divine, but still of themselves are purely creaturely
intelligible content. What the divine intellect does is generate essences and
pars of essences: rationality, animality, etc., and then combine them where
they are mutually compatible, attaching haecceities probably as well, and
finally the divine will actualizes the whole complex.  
  
I think positing them in the essence causes fewer problems, because then one
can avoid the apperance of change in God, and just say the creature as an
essence exists in the divine essence, and all the divine will does is
actualize it. this way, the divine essence 'shows' the creatable essences to
the divine intellect and will.  
  
varieties of these views were bandied about a lot in the 13th and ensuing
centuies and never condemned, so whether or not they are true, catholics can
hold them.",999
"@Garrett, 1) Would this mean we could possibly have two formal separations
between the ideas and the essence - the essence is formally distinct from the
intellect, and the intellect is formally distinct from the ideas it generates,
so ideas would have a type of uniqueness by this two-step formal separation?  
  
2) From what you say at the end, multiple positions on this issue are
available for Catholics, and the Magisterium hasn't showed any interest in
declaring for or against any of those, so Catholics are free to believe among
them?  
  
3) Now if we accept that the ideas have purely creaturely intelligible content
that makes them truly unique in themselves, would this perhaps undo the
exemplary cause altogether? What we'd be left with is the efficient cause and
some sort of generative cause attributed to the divine intellect, and also
some relation and similarity of the ideas to God insofar as they are rooted
and generated by God.  
  
Would it be permissible to drop the exemplar cause almost completely, or even
fully? Are there any orthodox Scholastics who held such a view?  
  
4) Another important option is to say that the divine ideas are both
reflections of God that are similar to the essence in a finite way, but are
also at the same time unique in themselves or have intelligible content that
isn't purely about God? In other words, both?  
  
Or maybe even that the very unique intelligible content also reflects God in
some way at the same time?  
  
If so, this would mean the two ways of viewing the ideas could be
complementary - God is infinitely unique in Himself and is even Uniqueness
itself in a way, so it's fitting that the unique non-exemplary content of
ideas complement and be connected to the content of them that IS also
reflective of God as well. What do you think?",1814
"1\. yes. the basic condition of the formal distinction is that it obtains
between things that have formal rationes that do not contain each other. So
the formal ratio of the divine intellect would be formally distinct from the
ideas it generates (or cognizes in the essence) and the divine essence. Each
idea would indeed be its own formal ratio.  
  
2\. yes, i know of know magisterial ruling on anything pertaining to the
ideas. Peter Thomae even calls them the 'plura aeterna'. All one has to say is
that God created, the mechanism is up for grabs.  
  
3\. i think we could just identify the creatura intellecta as the exemplar
cause. God still creates by means of it. So we have the divine intellect
producing or constituting the quiddities of creatables, the divine will
choosing which ones to actualize/create. imitation is a secondary
consideration, whihc occurs when the divine intellect compares the idea to the
divine essence (the debate there is whether imitation is what constituts the
idea, Scotus says no, Thomas yes).  
  
4\. That is basically what Peter Thomae says, that the divine essence is like
an infinite intelligible mirror and the essences of creatures are reflected
and shine out of it.  
  
I would still say the ideas have to be formally distinct from God, even if
they are in God. God certainly reflects the creatures, creatures maybe
reprsesent God insofar as they have pure perfections etc. that come from God.",1443
"Johnathan Bieler, ""Christ: the mystery of God truly made manifest? Leontius of
Byzantium and the Univocity of Being.""",117
"For Scotus, does univocity only apply on the level of concepts which we use to
talk about God, or can we also say that the univocity exists in reality as
well, not just as a property of the concepts we use?  
  
And even if Scotus doesn't think the reality is univocal in itself, can a
Catholic legitimately hold univocal reality in God that's not just conceptual?
Or would this be problematic for doctrine?",407
"3\. Wesley, yes, i would say the exemplar cause is the divine idea in the
divine intellect.  
  
All theories of divine ideas are pure speculation and opinion, none of this is
at any level of defined teaching. Some might say that given the general church
recommendation of Thomas, that his views on everything are authoritative in
some sense. But not me.  
  
4\. so, yes, there would be pure perfections in common with God, maybe the
transcendental notions as they are attached to God and creatures, but the
distinctly creaturely part would be the essence plus haecceity.

Did you notice my last reply in the ""Was Scotus Irish?"" comments? About the
ideas and some other things? What do you think of it?  
  
@Lee Faber,  
  
Quick question if you have the time - where does Scotus think the ideas are
meant to be located? In the divine essence, or only in the divine intellect
which generates them?  
  
If in the divine intellect, could we extrapolate from this that creation and
created ideas aren't just solely finite reflections of God, but have a sort of
uniqueness to them as well? Since the ideas would be rooted in the intellect
but not the essence, the ideas would reflect God's intellect but not the
essence, and there would then have to be some uniqueness factor that makes the
divine ideas formally unique in themselves in their intelligible content.  
  
In other words, there is something in the divine ideas which **doesn't**
reflect God. Would this be something that's possible to say in Catholic
theology?",964
"Hi Wesley, I'll check the other thread... I am not used to getting comments.  
  
Univocity for Scotus is a property of concepts only. He says God and creatures
are one in concept but agree in no reality outside the soul.  
  
One of Scotus' early followers, Antonius Andreae, held that there was a
corresponding reality between God and creatures, and he never got into trouble
with the church, as far as I know. Mostly, it would cause problems for divine
simplicity, which was considered doctrine as of lateran IV. There must be a
reality that is common to God and creatures and one that is common, so God
will have two realities.

"@Garrett, 3) So the exemplar cause would be the eternal idea of the creature
in God's intellect?  
  
Is the imitability of divine ideas (they imitate God in some way) doctrine, or
just a theological opinion? The same goes for exemplar causality - is it
doctrine, or just common opinion?  
  
  
4) So creatures represent or reflect God insofar as they have pure
perfections. Now if we say that creatures aren't just reflections of God in
their ratios, but have some unique content which doesn't reflect God as well,
would that content have to be outside the category of pure perfections?  
  
Would it be possible to say that the ratios of creatures necessarily have both
an element that reflects God AND an element that doesn't? Maybe even that they
are one and the same element, but with different aspects, one of which is
reflective of God, while the other isn't?  
  ",872
"@Garrett, When you say it would cause problems for divine simplicity, are you
referring to Antonius Andreae's position of there being a realiy between God
and creatures, or the position that there is something in the divine ideas
that doesn't reflect God, so they aren't purely reflections of God?",297
"@Garrett,  
  
a) Thanks for the clarification! One last thing I'm wondering about is that,
if we say that the divine ideas are closer to the divine intellect than our
ideas are to our intellect because they are an accident or changeable or could
exist separately from our own intellect, then this would seem to imply that
the divine ideas are more closely rooted and related to God than our ideas (or
maybe the ideas in our intellect are the same as the divine ideas?) are to our
own minds.  
  
b) One could then say that even the parts of the divine ideas that **aren't**
pure perfections and don't simply reflect God are still rooted in God and so
are still similar to Him in some way, even if they don't outright reflect Him.
Or that the **creaturely** part of the divine ideas which doesn't reflect God
still in some way reveals God to us as well - even if not as just a reflection
of God. What do you think?  
  
c) This then leads to the possibility that the two aspects of a divine idea -
the pure perfections reflecting God, and the creaturely part that's unique in
itself - are not only compatible but even **complement** each other as well.  
  
c) Say, when God brings about the New Creation we won't see created beings as
nothing more than reminders of God like an infatuated girl seeing everything
else in the world as just a reminder of her boyfriend in different ways -
we'll also see each thing as having a uniqueness in it that isn't just a
reflection of God. And those two will complement each other and make
themselves shine - things aren't just reminders of God, but they also aren't
just purely unique things without any reflection of God either.  
  
And since God is also infinitely unique in Himself and is Goodness itself, and
having both aspects present in the content of a divine idea is good, both the
uniqueness of creatures and their similarity to God are rooted in God, and
give greater glory to Him.

A recurrent conclusion of mine in re Duns Scotus seems to me to be closely
related: Aquinas writes metaphysics for the Afterlife. When we study
metaphysics again, in Heaven, we will realize that Aquinas was exactly right.
But Duns Scotus does Metaphysics for a Fallen Nature; for Those who Walk in
Darkness-  
  
Finally, the answer to the above Paradox of Time is artistic creation; because
the artist reaches for the solidity of the Past; and finds their Creation

1\. I don't see why not, though i don't know of anyone who did. Probably
ockham, but I don't know that for sure.  
  
2\. I think one could this off by reference to the divine ideas. As Scotus
defines an idea, it is the 'creatura intellecta', so it is not just a bad copy
of God, the divine idea of Socrates is Socrates 'qua understood.' Or you could
just reduce participation to the depedence of a creature on its cause. every
effect depends on a cause for its existence, the same is true for creatures.  ",744
"1) Well if they are outside the essence formally, they would only be contained
in the essence in the sense that the they aren't separable from God.  
  
Now you do say that the divine ideas of creatures can't be purely reflections
of God because they of creatures, and so their content is of creatures, but
couldn't one object by saying that though the ideas are about creatures, what
they ultimately are (their very content) just is finite reflections of God
since they are rooted in God, and each creature is just a different way of
reflecting God and nothing more?  
  
One can then imagine us seeing God in the New Creation, and so seeing all the
creatures in creation as just different reminders and reflections of God -
maybe like a young girl who's fallen in love with her boyfriend so much that
everything else has become just a different reminder of him. But this seems a
disappointing state of affairs, and so it seems fitting to say that the divine
ideas aren't just finite reflections of God, but have unique content in
themselves as well.  
  
  
2) Another way I saw of putting the idea of divine ideas being unique is from
Lossky, who complains in his Mystical Theology of the East that the West makes
creation just a poor copy of God and not unique because it includes the ideas
in the essence - in fact, I originally came across this whole issue of
uniqueness by reading him. He basically claims that they aren't the eternal
reasons of God contained within the very being of God or His essence - they
aren't just determinations of the essence to which creatures refer as to their
exemplary cause. So they aren't located in the essence, but are separated from
the essence and are instead in that which is after the essence - the will,
which determines the different modes of participating in God's creative
activity. Lossky then says that one of the supposed consequences of this would
be that the ideas are no longer necessary determinations of God's nature or
part of the intelligible content of the divine being.  
  
Now Lossky does tend to misunderstand Western theology, and his understanding
of divine simplicity may also be suspect insofar as it's neo-Palamite, but
could this sort of view Lossky describes become compatible with Catholic
theology?  
  
Another thing is the issue of exemplar causality, so I wonder how placing the
divine ideas formally outside the essence, and giving them uniqueness in the
sense that they aren't purely reflections of God due to their content being of
creatures, would work here.  
  
What do you think? This doesn't just apply to Lossky's view of uniqueness, but
also to what you described as well - would this eliminate all exemplary
causality for creatures? Or would we have a both/and situation where creatures
are both reflections of God but also unique in themselves - being both
exemplars and also unique things in their own right, so they aren't reducible
to the former?  ",2940
"@Garrett,  
  
Also, since effects pre-exist in their causes, and creation does have to
reflect God in a sense because otherwise we wouldn't be able to ascribe any
attributes (whether analogously or univocally) to God that we also find in
creatures, could one have a middle-position on this where creatures both
reflect God AND are also unique in themselves in the sense of not just being
copies or purely reflections of God?  
  
Maybe by appealing to the idea that God is Uniqueness itself and so by
reflecting God creatures also have their own intrinsic uniqueness as well? Or
by some other line of reasoning?  
  
Of course, one could say that created ideas are individually unique in
comparison to other created ideas, but aren't in comparison to God who is the
source of ideas. But I think one possible response to that would be that since
God is infinite and created ideas aren't fully similar to God, that even in
comparison to God created ideas likely have uniqueness.

someone from Ireland or Scotland, that we don't know when it changed to mean
only someone from Scotland. Think of the other ""Scotus"", Eriugena, who
unquestionably was Irish. According to the author, people in the thirteenth
century could be described as being either 'hibernicus' or 'scotus' depending
on their racial origins as native Irish or Norman invaders.",435
"Well, it depends on what what you mean by 'outside'. They could be 'outside'
the formal notion of the divine essence, the divine essence as such, but
somehow contained in it. That would not be contrary to cahtolic theology,
which in any case has not ruled on the matter. If you put the ideas as
'outside' in the sense of plato's demiurge, probably that would not be
maintained. But yes, the divine ideas are supposed to be representations of
creatures, by which God creates creatures, so they cannot be purely
reflections of God. One possibly helkpful image is that of Peter THomae, who
says the divine essence is an intelligible mirror, out of which shine/are
reflected creatures. Bonaventure posits three ways creatures exist, in
themselves, in their universals, and in their ideas in God. So the content of
the divine ideas are definitely creatures.",852
"Recently I was sent a discussion about the national origins of Duns Scotus. It
is [here](http://www.orwellianireland.com/scotus.html). There was a big
controversy about this among the 17th century Scotists. Many of the Irish
Scotists claimed him as their own. They did not, however, assign a town where
he was born.",315
"On the Thomistic view, as well as some independents after Aquinas, a divine
idea is just God knowing that the divine essence can be imitated in a certain
way. They are relations of imitability. Now Aquinas still claims God knows
creatures, has providence, etc., but the point is divine knowledge of
creatures happens by means of these imitatibility relations. Scotus claimed
the divine intellect generated various parts of essences and everything that
was not repugant could be joined, and among this latter class, the divine will
actualized some ideas to exist. He also says the divine ideas are primarily of
haecceities. On this view, the divine ideas would all be internal to the
divine intellect and will and not in the essence, so there would not be a
problem with divine simplicity. In other passages, however, he posits them in
the divine essence as representations that are formally distinct from each
other and from the divine essence.",944
"This list describes people from England as 'de anglia,' those from Ireland as
'de hymbernia', leaving 'Scotus' to be Scottish. What is more, the list
organizes people by regions: thus, on the page on which Scotus appears, we
have scholars from the Iberian peninsula, followed by Scotus, the English, the
Irish, and then the beginning of the Germans.",349
"Many thanks for highlighting this article but I honestly don't understand how
you can read it the way you have? Nearly all the 17th Irish historians list
the town in Ireland he came from, Downpatrick in Co. Down, as I believe I
pointed out. I also list three medieval sources, 14th and 15th century, that
state clearly he came from Ireland.  
  
That list that you highlight is the same one I mention in the text. Its not
decisive because Scotus could mean a person of Irish race, hence he wouldn't
necessarily be listed with the other people listed as from Ireland, if they
were Norman.  
  
Its true that its a reasonable way of reading that list to say he is Scottish
and the others are English and Irish etc, but because of the well known and
very widespread use of the word Scotus as meaning a person of the Gaelic race
in Ireland, it isn't as decisive as some make it out to be.  
  
Remember all these Latin writers are also quoting from Duns Scotus Eriugena,
and all the other long list of writers named Scotus floating around the
Medieval texts, who all were of Irish Gaelic ancestry and must have been
obviously so to these Medieval writers, so its reasonable to suppose they
meant that here as well. As I think I pointed out, I am saying you cannot be
definitive in any deductions based on that word Scotus from 1303 in my
opinion, its just used too often to mean Irishman to assume it means Scottish
in that list or any where else for that date, we need to get other facts to
settle the question, in my opinion.  
  
Anyway hopefully I have started a modern debate on the subject!",1592
"@Garrett, So it's perfectly compatible with Catholic theology to believe that
the divine ideas are outside the divine essence, and so have a certain
uniqueness to them making them not solely reflections of God?  
  
Is that correct?  
  ",237
"Thanks for your comment, when I get a chance I will revise my post.",67
"But whether or not such a distinction is true or not, it isn't relevant to the
question of Scotus' origins. For we have a contemporary document that contains
enough evidence to show Scotus' Scottish ancestry. This is the adhesion list
of 1303. In the dispute between the pope and the king of France, the king sent
officials to the various religious houses at the university and had them affix
their names to a list accepting the king's claims or denying them. Scotus is
on the list denying. The most recent edition of this list is in Courtenay.",544
"I have two questions about participation: Some say that Scotus infamously
rejected the idea of participation in his metaphysics - though that is false -
and that participation has never been part of magisterial authority. So:  
  
1) Does this mean then that one can be a Scholastic without accepting
participation metaphysics of creation? And also, were there any Scholastics
who truly rejected participation but are orthodox?  
  
2) One potential objection to participation is that it seems to make creation
unoriginal, or devalues it by making it a copy of God's own nature, and that
rejecting participation resolves this tension - what do you think of this?  
  
Does participation make creation just a finite copy of God's own nature? Can
one still attribute originality and uniqueness to creatures even if one
accepts participation?  
  
What do you think of these?",872
"@Garrett,  
  
Could you elaborate a bit more about creatura intellecta and not being a copy?
I think it sounds interesting.

"Just in time for Christmas I have uploaded a fresh collation of Mayronis'
Conflatus q. 12, the question on analogy, to the [Digital
Conflatus](https://lyfaber.blogspot.com/p/digital-conflatus-francisci-de-
mayronis.html). There is some interesting annotation identifying the opinions
of the Scotists, Thomists, Artists, and Aureolists, though the content of the
question is not terribly exciting. Mayronis rejects analogy at least for the
purposes of philosophy and theology (whether he accepts 'real' analogy remains
to be seen). The basic reason is how he classifies analogy, which he does by
placing it under equivocity, like Boethius and most of the Latin tradition.",670

Duns Scotus is missing in the parish.  
May 29, 2021  
Scandal at my parish  
I affirm the Athanasius Creed (Whoever desires to be saved should above all
hold to the catholic faith.Anyone who does not keep it whole and unbroken will
doubtless perish eternally...)in the parish but the priests and many of the
parishioners do not do the same.  
I live in the parish, Santa Maria di Nazareth, Casalotti, Boccea.It is a
20-minute drive from Rome's Battistini Metro Station.How can they offer/attend
Holy Mass and not affirm the infallible teaching of the Athanasius Creed?  
I affirm Vatican Council II interpreted rationally in the parish but the
priests and most of the parishioners do not do so.  
For me LG 8, LG 14, LG 16, UR 3, NA 2, GS 22 etc are practical exceptions for
the Athanasius Creed. In other words, they refer to known non Catholics saved
outside the Church. They refer to physically visible people saved without
faith and the baptism of water.Invisible and unknown people cannot be
exceptions to the Creed. So with this irrationality they make the Athanasius
Creed obsolete.  
My interpretation of Vatican Council II is rational and traditional.It is not
a break with the Creeds.  
  
How can the priests and people offer/attend Holy Mass with an irrational
interpretation of Vatican Council II etc ?  
When the priests and people in the parish do not affirm the Athanasius Creed
and Vatican Council II, do they no have to go for the Sacrament of Confession,
end the scandal and correct themselves in public ?  
For me the baptism of desire(BOD) and being saved in invincible ignorance(I.I)
refer to hypothetical and theoretical cases only. I cannot meet or see someone
saved as such.It is only God who can know if someone is saved with BOD and
I.I. So there are no practical cases of BOD and I.I for me.There are also no
practical exceptions to the past Magisterial ecclesiocentrism of the Catholic
Church.  
But with visible for them,BOD and I.I, the priests and catechists and others
in the parish, reject the strict interpretation of the dogma extra ecclesiam
nulla salus(EENS).  
They change the interpretation of Vatican Council II.Since for them, LG 8, LG
14, LG 16, UR 3, etc contradict the dogma EENS. There are practical exceptions
for them.  
So they have rejected the dogma EENS and the Athanasius Creed which says
outside the Church there is no salvation.  
  
They have changed the meaning of the Nicene Creed. It is "" I believe in three
or more known baptisms for the forgiveness of sins and they exclude the
baptism of water in the Catholic Church( so EENS is rejected)"".  
They have changed the meaning of the Apostles Creed. It is "" I believe in the
Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church,'which teaches the Catholic Church today
that there is known salvation outside the Church and so the Creeds and
Catechisms are obsolete in their old understanding"".  
They have changed the meaning of the First Commandment which now indicates for
them that outside the Catholic Church there is known salvation and so there is
true worship in non Christian religions.  
This is public heresy, scandal and schism and Holy Mass is offered/ attended,
by all in the parish.  
This scandal has to be rectified in public, before absolution is given in the
Confessional.-lionel Andrades
