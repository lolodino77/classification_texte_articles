"I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”",312
"This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.",490

"My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.",594
"Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?",998
"I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.",1131
"I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.",570
"We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.",1137

"I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.",1081
"Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.",639

"This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.",764
"Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.",1103

"I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.",297
"The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.",1233
"Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?",658
"In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.",2180

"There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.

"Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.",1684
"Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.",1053
"1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.",163
"4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.",732
"GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)",171
"Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.",1239

"Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.",550

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.,73
"Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:",1270
"5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god

"Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.",1683

"A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.

"Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.",798
"Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.",1325

"It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.",1191
"Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:",1454
"This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,

"Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer

issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s

"In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.",631
"I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.",241
"Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.",836
"This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.",1307
"An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.",1199

"Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.",1224
"This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**",607
"As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.",698
"The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition",352
"(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused",150
"I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.",293
"But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:",93
"This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.",726
"Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.",437
"Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.",1409
"If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs",113
"But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!",367
"Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).",611

"“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).",166
"Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.",1368
"could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.",141
"This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.",845
"When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:",1106
"In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises",89
"Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.",1006
"With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:",300
"If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative",148
"To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:",428
"Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.",1393
"Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.",1246
"This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?",1465
"The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)",143
"If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.",1371

"Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.",1712
"Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:",1052
"From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.",1704
"Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)",117
"So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.",1590
"My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:",1258

"I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:",197
"While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.",1145
"Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.",1528
"He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.",1845

"Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery

"“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)",301
"Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”

"Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness

"Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.",1963
"This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.",887
"Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.",1616
"If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.",1796

"Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against

experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.",1668

consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A

"I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.",925
"The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.",784
"Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.",969
"Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.",1527
"Fasting for three days straight in a church in the Highbridge section of the

"Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.",1651

"My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.",594
"I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.",1081

you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”",312
"Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?",658

"Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?",998
"The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.",1233
"This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.",764
"I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.",570
"We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.",1137
"Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.",1103

"I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.",1131
"This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.",490
"It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.",1191
"Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.",1053

"GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)",266
"In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.",2180
"This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,

"A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building

“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.

material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)",194
"Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.",1239
"Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.

"Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.",550

"There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,

"Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.",1683

"Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.",1325

"Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:",1270

5)there are 4 different arguments, first two are smith&grünbaum’s arguments

"Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.",1684

"Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.",1409
"I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.",293
"Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.",437
"In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises",89
"If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs",113
"An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.",1199
"Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.",1224
"could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.",141
"If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)",138
"Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.",836
"This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.

"This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.",726

these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate

that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:",1106

horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam

"In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.",631
"This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.",1307
"With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it

"Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.",1368
"Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).",611
"Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.",1006
"I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.",241
"This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.",845
"As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.",698

"If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.",1796
"So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.",1590
"“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in

"Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-

outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.",1528

"Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.",1246
"Electric fields theory (EFT) of consciousness, indeed similar to panpsychism,
at least _prima facie_ , is where panpsychists should place their chips. Tam
Hunt elaborates:",171
"This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?",1465
"Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.",1712
"From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.",1704
"Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge",1108
"Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.",884

"Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.",1616
"Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.",1963
"Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery

"Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:",1052
"Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.",1393
"If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.",1371
"He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.",1845
"To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:",428

"While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.",1145

"This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.",887
"My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:",1258

"The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:",334

"If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.",604
"In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.",1668
"Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.",1142
"The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.",784
"Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.",1651
"I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.",925

my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.",749
"Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.",969

"Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.",1527

"Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?",998

tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.",490
"Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.",639
"I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.",1131

"My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.",594
"I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.",297
"We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.",1137
"Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.",1103
"The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.",1233

sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.",570
"I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”",312
"This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.",764
"I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.",1081

"Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?",658
"G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)",348
"Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:",1454
"Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.",1684
"This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,

"2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.",83
"Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.",1325

"Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders

level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.",1239

"Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.",798
"It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-

it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee

why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,

"Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:",1270

"A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.

"Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.",1683
"4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.",732
"In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.",2180
"Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:",644
"Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.",1053
"As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.",698
"Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.",1409
"Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.",1006
"This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.",1307
"Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.",836
"I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.",241
"But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!",367
"This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.",726
"Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.",1368
"An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.",1199
"In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises",89
"This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.",845
"In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.",631
"Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.",437
"With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:",300
"(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused",150
"But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:",93
"If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative",148
"The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition",352
"I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.",293
"If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)",138

"When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:",1106

(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.",141
"Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.",1224
"Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).",611
"This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**",607
"“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).",166
"Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)",117
"If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.",1796
"Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our
memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-

"“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)",301
"Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.",884
"I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:",197
"Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.",1616
"Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.",1246
"This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?",1465

"Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.",1963
"Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.",1528

"Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.",1393
"So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.",1590
"To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:",428

fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)",143
"Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge",1108
"While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.",1145
"This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.",887
"My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:",1258

"He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.",1845
"If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.",1371
"From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.",1704
"Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.",1712
"To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:",159
"Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:",1052

"The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.",784
"If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.",604
"Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.",969
"It is standard procedure in philosophical practice to anticipate rebuttals. In
my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.",749
"In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.",1668

"The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:",334
"Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a

full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.",1142

"Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.",1527
"I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.",925

"Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.",1651

stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.",1131
"Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?",998
"The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.",1233
"My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.",594
"I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.",570
"I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”",312
"I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.",297
"Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?",658
"“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James",126
"I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.",1081
"Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.",1103
"Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.",639
"This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.",490

"This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.",764
"We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.",1137

"Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:",1454
"Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.",1683
"Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.",1325

"Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.",1239

"There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two

quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the

why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from

"Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.",1053
"This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,

"Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.",1684

"Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.",798

"Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a

of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.",550

"GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)",171
"In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.",2180
"It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.",1191

"A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:",935
"This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.",1307
"This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.",726
"An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.",1199
"In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises",89
"could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.",141
"Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.",836
"This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.",845
"As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.",698
"The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition",352

"This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.

form:",300
"I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.",293
"Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.",437
"But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:",93
"In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.",631
"When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:",1106
"If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)",138
"But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!",367
"If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs",113
"Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.",1409
"Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.",1006
"Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.",1368

"Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.",1224
"Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).",611
"Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”

"Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.",1246
"So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.",1590
"Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.",1712

"From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.",1704
"Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.",1528
"Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.",1393
"If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.",1796
"This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?",1465
"My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:",1258
"To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:",159
"Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our
memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-

"The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)",143
"While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.",1145
"This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.",887
"Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:",1052
"Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.",1616

"Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.",1963

"Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can

reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness

"“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)",301
"He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.",1845

that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.",1371

will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with

can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have

While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into

remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.",1668
"Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.",1651
"The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.",784
"Petting farm animals at Kira’s World Exotics Mini Zoo in Hatillo, Puerto Rico",77
"Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.",969

"I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.",925
"If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.",604

my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.",749
"Fasting for three days straight in a church in the Highbridge section of the
Bronx",82
"Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.",1142
"The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone

experiences as come to mind:",334

"Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.",639
"This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.",490
"We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.",1137
"I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.",1131

"Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?",998
"I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.",570
"Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.",1103
"“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James",126
"I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.",1081

"My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.",594
"This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.",764
"Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?",658
"I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.",297
"The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.",1233
"Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.",550
"Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.",1325
"5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.",241

L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature: Examining the
Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books, pp.179-214.",219
"Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:",1270
"It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.",1191

"Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.",1684
"4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.",732
"Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.",1683
"There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.

"Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.

"This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena

2014; 4 (4) DOI:

"A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:",935
"Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.",1239

"In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.",2180
"Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.",798

"1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.",163
"Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.",1053
"G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)",348
"G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)",194
"“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).",166
"This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.",845
"Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).",611
"This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.",1307
"But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!",367
"This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.

"In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises",89
"If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative",148
"Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.",1368
"Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.",836
"could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.",141
"An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.",1199
"Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.",1224
"I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.",293

"In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.",631
"Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.",1409
"Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.",437
"When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:",1106
"Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.",1006
"If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs",113
"As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.",698
"The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition",352
"This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.",726
"This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.",764
"We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.",1137
"This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.",490
"Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.",639
"I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.",570
"I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.",1131
"Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?",658
"I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.",1081

"Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.",1103
"The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.",1233
"My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.",594
"Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?",998
"I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”",312

days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.",297
"Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.",1325
"Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.",1053

"Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.",798
"Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:",1270

"This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,

2014; 4 (4) DOI:

"It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.",1191
"Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.",1239
"4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.",732
"In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.",2180

"Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.",1683
"G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)",194
"1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.",163
"Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.",550
"Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.",1684

"Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.

predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental

"A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.

"An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.",1199
"In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises",89
"With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:",300
"“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).",166
"Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.",437
"Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).",611
"Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.",1368
"Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.",1409
"If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)",138
"This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.",1307
"Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.",1224
"This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.",845
"I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.",241
"This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**",607
"As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.",698

"When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:",1106
"Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.",836
"The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition",352
"If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative",148
"I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.",293
"could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.",141
"But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!",367
"In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.",631
"This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.

"(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused",150
"Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.",1006
"Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.",1528
"My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:",1258
"From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.",1704
"Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge",1108
"Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.",1712

"If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.",1371
"“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)",301
"To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:",428
"This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.",887
"He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.",1845
"Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.",1246

"So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.",1590

"If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.",1796

"Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.",1963
"Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.",1393
"Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:",1052
"I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:",197
"The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)",143
"While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.",1145
"Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our
memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-
explained-its-how-we-check-our-memories/). _New Scientist_. 16 Aug 2016.

"Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.",1616
"This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?",1465
"Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.",884
"In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.",1668
"The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:",334

"Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.",1651
"Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.",969

"Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.",1142
"It is standard procedure in philosophical practice to anticipate rebuttals. In
my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.",749
"I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.",925

"Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.",1527
"If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.",604
"The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.",784
"Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?",658
"I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.",297
"We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.",1137
"This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.",490
"My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.",594
"Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.",1103

pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.",570
"I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”",312
"This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.",764

"Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?",998

"The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.",1233
"I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.",1081

"I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.",1131
"There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,

"Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.",1325

"Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.",1684

"Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:",644
"Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.",1053
"It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.",1191
"Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:",1270
"Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.",550
"2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.",83
"1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.",163
"Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.",1683
"Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:",1454

"Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.",1239

evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.",732

"This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be

possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.",798

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.,73
"G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of

"A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:",935
"In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.",2180
"If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs",113
"If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)",138
"This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.",726
"This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.",845
"Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.",1368
"With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:",300
"As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.",698

"could be restated as:

∴ All universes have a cause.",141
"This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.",1307
"The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition",352
"Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).",611
"“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).",166
"But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:",93
"(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused",150
"Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.",1224
"This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**",607
"I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.",241
"Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.",1006
"Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.",437

"An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.",1199
"Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.",1409
"In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises",89
"When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:",1106
"But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!",367
"If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative",148
"In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.",631
"Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.",836
"I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.",293

"This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.",764

issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.",570

"I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.",1081
"I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.",297
"I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the

loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”",312

"My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.",594
"I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.",1131

"Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?",998
"This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.",490
"We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.",1137
"Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.",639
"Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?",658
"The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.",1233
"Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.",1103
"A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:",935
"G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)",194

"It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.",1191
"In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.",2180
"Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:",1270

"Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.",1683

"4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.",732
"Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.",798

"Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.",1684

"Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:",1454
"This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,

"There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a

"Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.",1053

"Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.",1239

"Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.",1325

"Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.",550
"I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.",293
"This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.",845
"In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.",631
"An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.",1199

"But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:",93
"When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:",1106
"As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.",698
"I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.",241
"But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!",367
"could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.",141
"Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.",1006
"Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.",1409
"This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.",726
"Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).",611
"This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.",1307
"Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.",836

"Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.",437
"Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.",1224
"“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).",166
"In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises",89
"With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:",300
"This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**",607
"If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative",148
"If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs",113
"If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)",138
"The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition",352
"(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused",150
"Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.",1368
"Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.",1393
"Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:",1052
"Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.",1712
"I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:",197
"To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:",428

"Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.",1246
"Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.",1616
"This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.",887

"So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.",1590

"While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.",1145
"Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.",1963

"He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.",1845

"Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness

"Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists

"This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?",1465
"From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.",1704
"To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:",159
"My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:",1258
"If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.",1371
"Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.",1528
"“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)",301
"If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.",1796
"The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)",143
"Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our
memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-

"Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.",1651
"Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.",969
"The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:",334

reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.",749

"In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.",1668

"The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.",784

and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing

us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.",604
"Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.

"Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.",1527
"I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the

have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the

surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.",925

stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a

many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What

endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take

loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”",312
"The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.",1233
"Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?",658
"Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.",1103

"GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a

"Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.

"Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.",1325
"This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,

"Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.",1053
"4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.",732

"There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,

"Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:",1270

"Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.",1239
"Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.",798
"A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:",935
"Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.",1683
"It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.",1191

"In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve

"Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.",550
"Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.",1684

(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.",241
"If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)",138
"This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.",1307
"could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.",141
"In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.",631
"Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.",1224
"When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:",1106
"An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.",1199
"Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.",1409
"“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).",166
"I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.",293
"If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs",113
"This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.",845
"This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**",607
"Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.",836
"Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.",1368

"(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused",150
"This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.",726
"But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!",367
"But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:",93
"If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative",148
"With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:",300
"The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition",352
"As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.",698
"Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).",611

"Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.",1006
"In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises",89
"Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.",437
"Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.",1393
"Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)",117
"From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.",1704
"“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)",301
"This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?",1465
"While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.",1145
"So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.",1590
"Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.",1712
"This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.",887
"Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.",1246
"To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:",159
"Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge",1108
"Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we

have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery

"To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:",428
"Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.",1528
"Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.",1616
"My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:",1258
"Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.",1963

"Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”

"Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:",1052

"If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.",1796
"If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.",1371
"He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.",1845
"Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.",969
"The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:",334
"If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.",604
"Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.",1527
"In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.",1668

reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.",749

experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these

experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that

a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock

Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the

"Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.",1651

"Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.",1142

"I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.",570
"This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.",764
"“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James",126
"The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.",1233
"Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.",639
"Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?",658
"I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”",312
"Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.",1103
"We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.",1137
"I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.",1081

conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.",594

days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.",297
"Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?",998

"I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.",1131

"Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.",1684

"G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)",360
"Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:",1454
"Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.",1239
"5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.",241

"Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:",1270
"Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.",798

"There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a

"Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.",550
"This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,

"Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.",1053

an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:",644
"In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.",2180

"A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:",935

LLI.",83
3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.,73

material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)",194
"It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.",1191
"G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)",348

"Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.",1683
"4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.",732

"Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.",1325

"This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.

"As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.",698
"An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.",1199
"But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:",93
"This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.",845
"If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs",113
"In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.",631
"The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition",352
"Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.",1224
"But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!",367
"In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises",89
"(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused",150
"Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.",1409
"I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.",293
"This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.",726
"could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.",141
"When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:",1106
"Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).",611
"This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.",1307
"Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.",1368
"Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.",836
"Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.",437
"With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:",300
"Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.",1006
"I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.",241
"If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative",148
"Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.",884
"Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.",1393
"Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.",1712

"Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.",1963

"From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.",1704

"Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.",1246
"So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.",1590
"If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.",1371

"Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.",1528
"While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.",1145
"He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.",1845
"Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)",117
"Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge",1108
"Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:",1052
"To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:",428
"This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?",1465
"Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our
memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-

Web.).",2160
"This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.",887
"I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:",197
"My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:",1258

"If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.",1796
"Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.",1616

these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.",925

"The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.",784
"Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.",1651
"Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.",1142
"In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.",1668

"The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:",334
"Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.",1527

"Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.",969

"If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.",604

my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.",749
"I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.",1131

"This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.",490
"We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.",1137
"I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”",312
"Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.",1103

"Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?",998
"Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.",639

"I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.",570
"The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.",1233

Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?",658

"I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.",1081
"This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.",764
"My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.",594
"It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.",1191
"Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:",1270
"4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.",732
"There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.,73
"Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.",1239
"A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:",935
"_______. (2011a). “A Quantum-Theoretic Argument against Naturalism,” in Bruce
L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature: Examining the
Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books, pp.179-214.",219
"Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.",1683
"Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.",1325
"Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:",644
"This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,

completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)",348
"G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)",194
"Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.",550
"Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.",1053
"G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)",148
"Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:",1454

"In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.",2180

"Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.",1684
"Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.",1368
"But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:",93

distributed in the premise in which it occurs",113

"When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:",1106

"But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!",367
"Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.",1409
"This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.",1307
"This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.",726
"Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.",1006
"could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.",141
"Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).",611
"In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises",89
"If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative",148
"Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.",836
"If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)",138
"Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.",1224
"I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.",241
"(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused",150
"The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition",352
"An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.",1199
"Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.",437
"This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**",607
"With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:",300
"This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.",845
"As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.",698
"In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.",631
"I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.",293
"“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_

"While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.",1145

"Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”

"From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.",1704
"Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.",1246
"Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.",1712
"To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:",159
"“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)",301

structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some

"This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just

"Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.",1963
"Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery

"Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.",1528
"Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge",1108
"My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:",1258
"Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:",1052

_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.",1371
"So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.",1590

"I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:",197
"To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:",428
"Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)",117
"Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.",1393
"This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.",887
"If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.",1796
"He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.",1845

"Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.",1527
"Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.",969
"The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.",784

"The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:",334
"If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.",604

my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.",749
"I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.",925
"Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.",1651

"Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.",1142
"In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.",1668

"Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?",998
"I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any

"We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.",1137
"This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.",490
"I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.",1131

pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.",570
"Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.",639
"Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do

worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.",764

"My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.",594
"The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.",1233
"Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?",658

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.,73
"G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)",348
"2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.",83
"Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:",1270
"Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:",1454
"G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)",194
"Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.",550
"1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.",163
"It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.",1191

"4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.",732

causation thesis used to explain Jon-local correlations with local
correlations.  
5)there are 4 different arguments, first two are smith&grünbaum’s arguments

"Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.",1683
"5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.",241
"G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)",148
"Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.",1684

5) What do you think about Leon and Smith’s QM-based arguments for atheism",258
"Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.",1053

"In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.",2180
"This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,

"Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.",1239
"Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.",1325

"A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.

scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having

possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no

"There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their

why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense

"The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition",352
"If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative",148
"This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.",845
"But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:",93
"Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.",437
"When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:",1106
"could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.",141
"Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.",836
"Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).",611
"As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.",698
"This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**",607
"Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.",1006
"“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).",166
"With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:",300

"But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!",367
"Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.",1368
"An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.",1199
"Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.",1224
"This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.",1307
"In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.",631
"I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.",293
"Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.",1409
"If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs",113

"This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.",726

"I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.",1081
"My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.",594
"I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”",312
"This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.",764

"Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?",998
"This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.",490
"We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.",1137

"Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But

them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital

"The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.",1233

so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a

"Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.",1239

"Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.",550
"Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.",1683
"2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.",83
"G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)",360
"This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena

"Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:",1270
"There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.
_Symmetry_ , 2020; 12 (9): 1533 DOI:
[10.3390/sym12091533](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12091533)",922
"Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.",798
"It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.",1191
"A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:",935
"4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.",732

"In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.",2180
"Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:",1454
"Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-

issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s

"Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.",1325
"GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)",171
3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.,73
"G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)",194
"Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.",1053
"1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is

local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?

5) What do you think about Leon and Smith’s QM-based arguments for atheism",258
"GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)",266
"G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)",348
"Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.",1684
"Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).",611
"As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.",698
"(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused",150
"“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).",166
"Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.",1224
"An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.",1199
"If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)",138
"The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition",352
"Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.",437
"Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.",1368

"In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises",89
"Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.",1409
"Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.",836
"But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!",367
"If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative",148
"could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.",141
"This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.",1307
"If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs",113
"With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:",300
"This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**",607
"This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.",726

"Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.",1006
"This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.",845
"In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.",631
"When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:",1106
"I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.",293
"I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.",241
"But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:",93
"Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?",998

to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I

had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.",594

annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I

hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.",1081

sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.",570
"Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?",658

"The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.",1233
"We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.",1137
"Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital

"Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.",1103
"I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.",1131

as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the

"This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,

why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.

"It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.",1191
"Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.",1053

"Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.",1239

"Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.",1683

"Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:",1454

"Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.",1325

"A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:",935

"Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.",1684
"1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is

"Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.",798

"Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:",1270
"4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.",732
"In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.",2180

these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric

collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if

"Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.",1409

"As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.",698

"An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.",1199

"This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.",1307
"This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.",845
"I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.",241
"In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises",89
"Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).",611
"Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.",836
"Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.",437
"Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.",1006
"This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.",726

rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!",367

"could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.",141
"This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**",607
"When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:",1106
"Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.",1368
"Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.",1224
"If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative",148
"The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition",352
"If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs",113
"But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:",93
"In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.",631

"I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:",197
"While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.",1145
"To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:",159
"This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.",887
"From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.",1704
"My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:",1258
"If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.",1371
"Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge",1108

"Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:",1052

"Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.",1616
"Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.",884
"Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)",117
"So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.",1590
"If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.",1796
"This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?",1465
"Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.",1712

"Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-

outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.",1528
"Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank

into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.",1963
"“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)",301

"Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery

"Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.",1393

"To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:",428
"He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.",1845

Hunt elaborates:",171
"Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.",1246
"I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.",925

"Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.",1142

"Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.",1651

my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-

reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.",749
"Riding the Nitro at Six Flags in Jackson, NJ in the front row",61
"Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.",969
"The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.",784

"Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.",1527

"In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.",1668
"If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.",604
"The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone

experiences as come to mind:",334

the limits of phenomenal experience. I do not disagree that there is
accompanying phenomenal experience for any interaction between an object and
our senses. I do disagree that what it is like for me to smell roses is
peculiar and markedly different from your experience of smelling a rose. I
happen to think our experiences are roughly equal. Whether you or I like the
smell of roses or not involves more than just the phenomenal experience. In
other words, there’s a lot of background noise that explains why you like the
smell more than I do. Perhaps I associate the smell of roses with wakes and
funerals rather than with candlelit dinners and weddings. The noise is not

"When one normally thinks of reincarnation, one has in mind a caricature, the
spirit of a Jane Doe coming to inhabit a frog, unbeknownst to anyone, but
arguably Jane Doe herself. This, however, is an oversimplification. While
reincarnation is often considered an idea lauded by Eastern mystics, modern
day science can be marshaled in to lend support to the idea of reincarnation,
though in ways completely unexpected. For instance, one would usually hear the
usual tripe: since matter and energy cannot be created nor destroyed, one’s
consciousness must live on after death. The argument I want to offer is more

_anattā_ , but a resolution isn’t difficult to come by. Before offering a
solution, I defer to Wildman:",177
"This, in fact, falls on the horns of a dilemma Buddhists have. Recall,
Buddhists hold to the concept of _anattā_ (no self). While I may have thrown
around the word ‘identity’, this need not imply that I believe identity to be
_real_ and _substantive_. In fact, I think it is entirely illusory and that if
we interact with enough people, we will find that we have more in common than
we would like to admit. Some of us have delusions of grandeur; we have god and
savior complexes, see ourselves as fixers, and believe that there is no
problem we cannot solve. Others choose to mind their business, to not take on
a deep personal investment in the struggles even loved ones go through, and
instead choose to let the people around us work through their own problems. In
one way or another, it is likely that my two brief sketches of identity
resonate with my readers. Either you are one who suffers from delusions of
grandeur and you base even your romantic relationships on this futile attempt
to save everyone. Or, you are someone who has no deep personal investment in
the problems even the people closest to you have; this isn’t to say you refuse
to help when asked, but you prefer to let people find their own way. If one of
the two people I have described describes aspects of you, then you are further
to committing to the premise that mental states are finite and that therefore,
identities are limited.",1408

"Perhaps not in the next generation of life, or even in the next ten
generations, but at some point, a sentient being will be born who believes,
perhaps mistakenly, that they are me. To believe this, you need only believe
that mental states, whether tied to a brain, or to intricate nervous systems,
are finite. If such states are finite and the combination of such states and
functions are finite, then there are only so many identities to go around.
Given a long enough time, someone will come along and believe that they are
exactly who Napoleon thought he was.",563
"Instead, I would like to focus on mental states themselves and argue that
though there are potentially innumerable brain states, they are finite. Even
if we capture every brain state of every organism in the universe, and include
also the correlate states of organisms that are conscious though lacking a
brain, the total number of mental states do not stretch infinitely.
Furthermore, the combinations of brain states, right down to the size and
function of my brain or your brain, in particular, are finite. To put it
another way, let us say that there is a limitation in the communication
between one’s prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. This may result in autism or
schizophrenia (Watson, Thomas C et al. “Back to front: cerebellar connections
and interactions with the prefrontal cortex.” _Frontiers in systems
neuroscience_ vol. 8 4. 4 Feb. 2014, doi:10.3389/fnsys.2014.00004). With these
particular disorders, there are a number of hallmark behavioral traits. This
gives some credence to the idea that brain states are fundamentally finite and
do not, as it were, stretch on forever.",1089
"My resolution is that while there is no self, no concrete identity, what
persists are the illusions of a self or an identity brought about by the
limited combinations of mental states humans experience. This is why so many
of us come to have exactly the same ideas about ourselves, despite the fact
that we are different people with vastly different past experiences. This is
why mental and cognitive disorders feature an array of hallmark symptoms. To
illustrate this even better, think of the way genes encode phenotypic
features. Straight thumbs, for instance, are expressed with a capital S
whereas hitchhiker thumbs are recessive alleles expressed with a lowercase s.
This peculiarity, assuming you have it, does not belong to you. There are
other people who have hitchhiker thumb and they have it because gene
expression in their genomes have resulted in this phenotypic feature.
Likewise, our mental states, the manner in which brain regions communicate
with one another, and the way in which our particular neurons fire in our
brains create the same illusions of a static identity, packaged with a linear
life narrative that we can literally draw a straight line through from our
first memories in childhood through today.",1230

"Unfortunately, we are no longer so taken by behaviorists and know that human
beings are a lot more than simply a finite set of behaviors. We have our
preferences, things we are repulsed by, idiosyncrasies, and personalities to
speak of. Even then, I think that the combination of traits that make you
_you_ , no matter how multifarious, are finite. This implies that given a long
enough time, some sentient being, whether homo sapien or something very
similar to our own species, will come to believe in the same _you_ you believe
you are. This, to my mind, is how naturalism makes room for reincarnation.",605
"There is no substantive self that persists, a soul as it were. There is,
however, a persistent illusion in all of us and I do not put it passed a being
eons from now to think that s/he is exactly who I think I am. Furthermore, I
do not discount the idea that s/he will _feel_ , phenomenologically speaking,
exactly as I do. There is this sense that _I am_. Whether or not identity is
real, the illusion is powerful enough to lead me to believe I am unique and
that there will never be another exactly like me. This is folly. So while
there is no substantive soul in me or in my cat, there are a number of mental
states, resulting from brain and nerve interactions, that make both of us
_feel_ like we are a unique individuals never to be replicated. I conclude
that it is far likelier that since there are not infinite mental states to go
around, there are not infinite illusions to go around either. What we refer to
as the soul or identity has its boundaries and limits. There will be another
_you_ , so in that sense, even after death, should the universe persist, _you_
will live again with no recollection of the _you_ you are right now.",1142
"This may seem particularly discomforting for some readers. For others, they
may think that this idea is not developed enough. I admit, the argument is
very bare bones and could use more flesh. That, however, does not mean the
argument is unsound. I happen to be convinced, first and foremost, that mental
states and what we call identities do not stretch to infinity and that
therefore, there are only so many _yous_ to go around. As such, _you_ will
live again or be reborn. This is how naturalism makes room for something as
mystical as reincarnation. The lesson is that naturalists should shun the
habit of dismissing an idea because it is religious or _prima facie_
supernatural. There might be a kernel of truth to the idea of reincarnation.
That remains to be seen, but my argument is certainly a good place to start.",823

"We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.",1137
"This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.",490
"Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?",998
"I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”",312
"This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.",764

"I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.",297
"Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?",658

"Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.",1103
"My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.",594

"I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.",1081
"I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.",1131
"Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.",639

"The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.",1233
"I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.",570
"Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:",1454
"1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.",163

"Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.",798

"Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.",1684
"Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:",1270
"G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)",360
"Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.",1239

"G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)",148
"In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.",2180

"Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.",1683
"Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.",1325
"4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.",732
"Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.",550
"This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena

"It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.",1191

"Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.",1053
"A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics

"GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)",266
"5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.",241
"There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.

"We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.",1137
"I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”",312
"Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?",998

"The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.",1233

"I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.",570
"This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.",490
"I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.",1131
"I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.",297
"This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.",764
"Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?",658
"Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.",639
"My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.",594
"Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.",1103

in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take

"Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.",1684
"Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer

including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.",1325
"Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.",798
"Great post, and i have 5 questions on this  
1) What do you think about G2 is the all physical cause-effect relations are
local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?

Contemporary Physics and Philosophy. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, pp. 75-103.",506
"Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:",1270
"This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,

"In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.",2180
"4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.",732
3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.,73
"G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)",194
"There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.
_Symmetry_ , 2020; 12 (9): 1533 DOI:

"Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.",550
"1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.",163
"Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:",1454
"2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.",83
"Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.",1239
"Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.",1053

"It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-

it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.",1191

so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of

"We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.",1137

"Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?",998
"Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.",639
"Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?",658
"My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.",594
"I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.",570

"I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.",1081
"The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.",1233
"I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”",312
"Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his

problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)",194
"This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,

"Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.",550
"Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.",1239

"1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is

"2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.",83
"It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.",1191
"Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.",1684
"G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of

Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)",360
"Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:",1270

"G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)",348
"Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:",1454
"G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)",148
"Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.",1325
"In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.",2180

"Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.",1053
"4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.",732
"There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.

"Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.",1683

"Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.",798

"A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.

admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled

fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how

question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.",845
"(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused",150
"As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.",698
"In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.",631
"This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.",726
"Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.",836
"could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.",141
"The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition",352
"This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.",1307
"Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.",1368
"Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.",1224

"Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.",437
"When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:",1106
"But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!",367
"I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.",241
"An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.",1199
"Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.",1006
"If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)",138
"Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.",1409
"Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).",611
"In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises",89

account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,

"While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.",1145

that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:",1052

"If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.",1796
"If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which

that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.",1371

"Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.",1528
"Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.",1712
"Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain

"From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.",1704
"“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct

"Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.",1963
"So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.",1590
"My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:",1258
"The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)",143
"This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?",1465
"To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:",428
"Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.",1616
"Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.",1393
"He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.",1845

"Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge",1108
"Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.",884
"Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery

memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-

"In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.",1668

"Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.",1651

leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.",749

"Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.",1527
"I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.",925
"Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.

experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.",784
"Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.",969

experiences as come to mind:",334
