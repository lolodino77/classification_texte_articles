"> This book critically assesses arguments for the existence of the God of
> classical theism, develops an innovative account of objects’ persistence,
> and defends new arguments against classical theism. The authors engage the
> following classical theistic proofs: Aquinas’s First Way, Aquinas’s De Ente
> argument, and Feser’s Aristotelian, Neo-Platonic, Augustinian, Thomistic,
> and Rationalist proofs. The authors also provide the first systematic
> treatment of the ‘existential inertia thesis’. By connecting the thesis to
> relativity theory and recent developments in the philosophy of physics, and
> by developing a variety of novel existential-inertia-friendly explanations
> of persistence, they mount a formidable new case against classical theistic
> proofs. Finally, they defend new arguments against classical theism based on
> abstract objects and changing divine knowledge. The text appeals to
> students, researchers, and others interested in classical theistic proofs,
> the existence and nature of God, and the ultimate explanations of
> persistence, change, and contingency.",1096
"> Recent divine command theorists make a serious and impressive case that a

"> Atheistic Platonism is an alternative to both theism and nihilistic atheism.
> It shows how any jobs allegedly done by God are better done by impersonal
> Platonic objects. Without Platonic objects, atheism degenerates into an
> illogical nihilism. Atheistic Platonism instead provides reality with
> foundations that are eternal, necessary, rational, beautiful, and utterly
> mindless. It argues for a plenitude of mathematical objects, and an infinite
> plurality of possible universes. It provides mindless rational grounds for
> objective values, and for objective moral laws for the persons who evolve in
> universes. It defines a meaningful way of life, which facilitates self-
> improvement. Atheistic Platonists argue for computational theories of life
> after death. Atheistic Platonism includes a rich system of spiritual
> symbols. It values transformational practices and ecstatic experiences.

"Here’s an another argument to add to [the
list](https://exapologist.blogspot.com/2022/06/120-or-so-arguments-for-
atheism.html). It proceeds from a principle about absences that several able
philosophers defend (E.g., Kris McDaniel):",233
"Suppose the principle is true. Now go to a possible world in which God
refrains from creating (assume, as traditional theism does, that God has
leeway freedom in creating). In that world, there are contingent things
uncreated by God (namely, absences of creatures). But according to traditional
theism's aseity-sovereignty doctrine, there can be no contingent things that
are not created by God. Therefore, traditional theism is false.",435
