"Hereâ€™s an another argument to add to [the

philosophers defend (E.g., Kris McDaniel):",233
"Suppose the principle is true. Now go to a possible world in which God
refrains from creating (assume, as traditional theism does, that God has
leeway freedom in creating). In that world, there are contingent things
uncreated by God (namely, absences of creatures). But according to traditional
theism's aseity-sovereignty doctrine, there can be no contingent things that
are not created by God. Therefore, traditional theism is false.",435

"Pascal famously argued that practical reasoning should lead people to try to
form within themselves a commitment to religious practice and obedience, based
upon a belief in God. I propose to take a less ambitious argument, which I
call the Sensible Argument, and use it to present The Puzzle. I argue that
there is a huge puzzle here, about the radical dissonance between the beliefs
and practices of many of the purportedly religious. There are, I will argue,
good reasons to doubt, concerning many (clearly not all or indeed most)
purported religious believers, whether they are indeed believers, or at least
whether their beliefs are strong; and religion seems to greatly increase the
risks of deception, duplicity, and hypocrisy, as well as self-deception and
inauthenticity. By turning towards a religious form of life, one will
therefore be adding great morality-related risks. Arguably, if there is a God
who deeply cares about individual moral behaviour, he would punish religious
moral transgressors more than the secular ones. One is unlikely to be saved
from hell (or other severe divine punishment) by becoming religious. If one is
going to wager, it seems much more sensible to wager on the secular side.",1217
"The fact that orthodox theists, from at least Augustine and all the way to the
present, have seen logic as the expression of single, rational, divine Mind is
at least some evidence that theism expects and predicts logical monism. But
[the case](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10992-008-9082-6)
[against logical monism](https://www.st-
andrews.ac.uk/~ac117/papers/LogicalNihilism.pdf) \-- and for the disjunction
of logical pluralism and logical nihilism -- is more plausible than the case
for logical monism. But the truth of the disjunction of logical pluralism and
logical nihilism is prima facie more surprising on theism than on naturalism.
Therefore, the case for the disjunction of logical pluralism and logical
nihilism provides at least some evidence against theism.",786
"Recent empirical work on [motivated
reasoning](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phc3.12828)
indicates that it is strongly resistant to detection, even despite our best
efforts (Ballantyne 2015; Pronin et al. 2002). Perhaps worse, other work shows
that attempts to preempt motivated reasoning reinforce its impact (Ehrlinger
et al. 2005; Schwitzgebel & Ellis 2017). This is surprising on theism, given
that it's surprising that God would design our cognitive faculties in a way
that's highly disposed to unreliability -- and likely without remedy --
especially in ways that can be morally pernicious. By contrast, it's not
surprising on naturalism, since nature is ""indifferent"" to our welfare on that
hypothesis, and since motivated reasoning is conducive to survival and
reproduction (Mercier & Sperber 2011). Therefore, the existence of motivated
reasoning is at least some evidence for naturalism vis-a-vis theism.",941

"It's not clear that there's a metaphysics and epistemology of modality that
can vindicate a cogent modal ontological argument for classical theism.
Theistic activism and theistic conceptualism with respect to possible worlds
are a bad fit with the modal ontological argument (circularity). But so is
Platonism about possible worlds (runs afoul of the aseity-sovereignty
doctrine). Perhaps a dispositionalist/powers-based account of modality is
compatible with the modal ontological argument, but prima facie,
dispositionalism entails moderate modal skepticism (cf.
[Jacobs](https://philpapers.org/rec/JACAPT-2),
[Vetter](https://philpapers.org/rec/VETPPA)), thereby undermining the
possibility premise in the modal ontological argument. What's left? Modal
fictionalism? That's already been shown to imply [devastating

"Which view is correct: the substance-first view or the property-first view?
This question has potentially huge implications for the disagreement between
theists and non-theists.[1] This is because, prima facie, _orthodox monotheism
entails the substance-first view._ And this in turn is because, prima facie,
_God_ is a substance, and is prior to all else that exists. Therefore, if
there are reasons to prefer the property-first view, then there are thereby
reasons to prefer non-theism to theism.",498
"My second worry is the one I want to briefly focus on in this post. The worry
is that it fails to get at what is potentially a deeper distinction, and one
that's potentially more illuminating than the distinction between physicalism
and supernaturalism. The distinction I have in mind is at the level of _basic
ontological categories_ and _categorical priority_ \-- in particular, the
level of the ontological priority of the categories of _substance_ and
_property_. According to a standard and historically prominent view,
substances are more fundamental than properties (or at least: substances are
no less fundamental than properties). Accordingly, let's call this sort of
view _a substance-first ontology_.",711

"The evidence for fine-tuning confirms both demiurgism and panentheism over
theism, and in this way is good evidence against theism. This is because the
intuitive and empirical evidence against creation _ex nihilo_ creates a strong
drag on theismâ€™s prior probability not suffered by demiurgism and panentheism,

"Why does a universe exist? Because (as we know from our observations of the
actual world) there is a compossible distribution of qualities in some
""region"" of the world-whole that comprises a universe. So by that fact and
NMPSR, there is a presumption to think that it is _inevitable_ that there is a
_fusion/bundle_ of those properties -- i.e., a mereological fusion of
qualities that make up a configuration space, along with a fusion of phase and
amplitude properties, that compose a universal wavefunction. From non-
spatiotemporal property configurations like this, you necessarily get
spatiotemporal universes that logically supervene upon them.[3]",654

otherwise, we should assume _all_ possible universe quality fusions exist
inevitably and necessarily within the world-whole of qualities, and this is
one of them.[4]",237

latter because it's a better fit with with quantum holism/entanglement

"[1] On Paul's account, the relation of mereological bundling here is not a
fundamentally spatiotemporal one of spatiotemporal parts composing a
spatiotemporal whole. This is because contemporary physics seems to have shown
that spacetime isn't fundamental (think, for example, of wave function realism
with respect to quantum mechanics, theories of quantum gravity that take
spacetime to be emergent, etc.).",407
"[2] Question: How does a quality become spatiotemporally localized on Paul's
view? Answer: By bundling with spatiotemporal properties/relations: ""Objects
may have their locations in virtue of being fused with whatever location
properties and relations there are that define the actual space of the world,
and many objects will have a physical structure in virtue of having location
properties and relations as parts of their fusions, or in virtue of being part
of a larger fusion which has location properties and relations as parts. The
character of the space might not be what we take the character of ordinary
spacetime to be, but the structure of the space is generated by fusing
qualitative properties with relevant properties and relations that define the
space as determined by modern physics. Hence, the view is consistent with (and
explicitly accommodating of) various approaches in modern physics: it is
friendly to structuralism, and is perfectly consistent with realist
interpretations of the ontology of quantum mechanics, for example, with
realism about the wavefunction."" (Paul, Building the World From Its
Fundamental Constituents"", p. 242).",1157

"I think a naturalist who adopts Paul's one-category ontology can exploit her
account to explain the existence and fine-tuning of our universe. To start,
consider that if we assume with Paul that the world-whole is just the sum of
all qualities, and they can combine in various ways in accordance with the
constraints of their intrinsic natures, _what prevents them from combining in
every possible such way_? It would be mysterious why they fuse/bundle in some
ways and not others if they didn't fuse/bundle in every way consistent with
their natures. Paul's one-category ontology thus naturally generates pressure
to accept a mereology-focused variant of Spinoza's negative PSR:",679

the universal wavefunction (indeed, it allows for all possible parameter

Qualities are universals -- i.e., repeatable entities -- that (arguably) exist
necessarily and _a se_ , and have a nature closer to Aristotle's immanent
(non-substantial) forms than Plato's transcendent forms (there are no
uninstantiated qualities). All the rest of reality is ultimately explained in
terms of mereological fusions of n-adic qualities.[1] The fusion relation is a
composition relation, and so derivative entities are composed of basic
qualities.[2] The resultant picture is _mereological bundle theory_ :",898
