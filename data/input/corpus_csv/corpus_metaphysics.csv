and [Part 6](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/10/feser-on-schmid-
on-existential-inertia-theoretical-virtues-and-vices-part-6/). This post is
Part 7, which deals with everything Feser says in his section ‘An argument
against EIT’. In my next post, I’ll collect all the parts together into a
single post.",1143
"After spelling out the argument from the Principle of Proportionate Causality
(PPC), Feser proceeds to address my rejoinders thereof.",133
"Before getting to Feser’s rejoinders, I want to spell out what I have come to
see as the biggest problem for the argument. I don’t think I raised this
problem in the IJPR article, but I take it to be the most serious problem for
the argument.",242
"In particular, I think premise (3) is straightforwardly false, and I have
indirectly explained why throughout this series. Premise (3) says: “Something
has existential inertia if and only if it has of itself [i.e., _intrinsically_
or _internally_ [Fn]] a tendency to persist in existence once it exists.”",304
"[Fn] It is clear from context, it seems to me, that this is what Feser means.
Consider, for instance, that Feser seems to infer that ‘no material substance
has a tendency of itself to persist in existence once it exists’ from the
facts that ‘there are no other internal principles from which such a substance
might derive such a tendency’ and ‘form and matter are internal principles
from neither of which the substance can derive a tendency to persist’. This
inference only seems to work if by ‘of itself’ Feser means ‘intrinsically or
internally’.",549
"The left-to-right side of the biconditional here says that an existential
inertial tendency intrinsic to S is a necessary condition for S’s persisting
inertially. But this is essentially equivalent to what we saw Feser claiming
in [Part 3](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/feser-on-schmid-
on-existential-inertia-part-3/). Therein we saw Feser say, “if EIT is false,
then it is not something intrinsic to the water; and if there is no sustaining
cause, then it will not be something extrinsic to it either.”",523
"But we also saw that this was mistaken. It is false that if there is no
sustaining cause at t [or from (t-1) to t, which I shall hereafter drop], then
the explanation for an object’s existence at t will not be something extrinsic
to the object at t. For there are whole swathes of explanations of an object’s
persistence that do not adduce sustaining causes and yet adduce facts
extrinsic to the object itself at t.",415
"Consider, for instance, one of the explanations I proffered in section 3 of my
[lengthier blog post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-
on-schmid-on-the-aristotelian-proof/) and which I’ll adumbrate here:",225
"For S to **fail** to exist at m despite existing from [m*, m), m* < m, is for
some **change** to occur.[Fn] But a change occurs only if some factor causally
induces said change. Hence, if no factor causally induces a change, then the
change won’t occur. Thus, if no factor causally induces S to fail to exist at
m despite existing from [m*, m), then S exists at m. Once we add that nothing
came along to causally induce this — that is, once we addd that nothing came
along to destroy S from m* to m — it simply follows that S exists at m. [Cf.
Section 4.1 in the [lengthier blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/) for more on this line of thought.]",713
"Here, we seem to have a perfectly respectable, perfectly legitimate
explanation of S’s existence at m — and this explanation adduces facts outside
of or extrinsic to S at m. And the explanation does, indeed, tell us how S
exists at m. That was a straightforward deduction of the explanatory facts
cited [namely, (i) S existed immediately before m, (ii) nothing causally
induced S’s cessation at m [i.e., nothing destroyed S from the immediately
prior moment(s) through m], and (iii) a change occurs only if some factor
causally induces said change]. And so we do, indeed, have sufficient
explanation for S’s existence at m, one that doesn’t adduce some extrinsic
sustaining efficient cause. For me at least, the explanation certainly seems
to remove mystery as to why/how S exists at m. The present explanation
**does** , indeed, tell us how S exists at m. [I discuss and defend EIT-
friendly explanations of persistence that adduce facts extrinsic to S at m
along similar lines in [this document
here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VJylrJ-8olSgbUUf6m0FOeSP-
RrrJJO_/view?usp=sharing) on no-change accounts. And again, Feser need not
engage with this document if he responds. I include it for those who want to
dig deeper.]",1226
"Or consider inertialist-friendly explanations based on [laws of
nature](https://drive.google.com/file/d/186uxfg9LzO_DuZFHjn1qjN828KzJhKsW/view?usp=sharing),
which adduce facts extrinsic to S at m. Or consider inertialist-friendly
explanations based on [transtemporal explanatory
relations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_r4u8vkQ_4D6HwKL-
Mkn20ieJ_i_e13O/view?usp=sharing), which adduce facts extrinsic to S at m. Or
consider an explanation by appeal to the de dicto necessity of the inertial
thesis (à la [propositional necessity
accounts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XBxLyZNpKyvXHyJ8e91C_OrER3Wn60N-/view?usp=sharing)).
And on and on. Feser’s claim is just false.",672
"To drive home the point, consider again Explanans 1, Explanans 2, and
Explanandum from [Part
5](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/09/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-vicious-circularity-and-the-metaphysics-of-eit-part-5/):",241
"In the case of the transtemporal understanding of the first IJPR account, we
have:",82
"**Explanans 1** : (i) there is an absence of sufficiently causally destructive
factors operative on S from (m-1) to m [where (m-1) is the moment immediately
prior to m], and (ii) the state and/or existence of temporal concrete objects
(or, at least, those within EIT’s quantificational domain) at a given moment
(m-1) at which they exist causally produce their existence at the next moment,
m, provided that no sufficiently causally _destructive_ factors are operative.",469
"In the case of the no-change understanding of the first IJPR account, we have:",78
"**Explanans 2** : (i) S existed immediately before m — that is, at (m-1) —
(ii) if S existed immediately before m but fails to exist at m, then S’s
cessation is (or involves, or entails) some kind of change, (iii) nothing
causally induces S’s cessation at (m-1) or m — that is, nothing destroyed S
from the immediately prior moment, (m-1), through m — and (iv) a change occurs
only if some factor causally induces said change.",426
"Now, neither Explanans 1 nor Explanans 2 cite facts that explain the
Explanandum [S’s existence at m] that are intrinsic to that Explanandum [i.e.,
that are intrinsic to S at m or S’s existence at m]. And yet both of these
scenarios are ones in which S inertially persists. And hence something can
inertially persist [i.e., persist without continuously and concurrently
operative sustenance from without] without this inertial persistence being
derived from [or resultant from or explained by or constituted by] some
intrinsic principle [or tendency or what have you]. (Instead, for each non-
first moment m of S’s life, the explanation of S at m is extrinsic to S at m
but not a concurrently operative extrinsic sustaining efficient cause.[Fn])
Hence, premise (3) is false.",774
"[Fn] Alternatively, if one wants to say — at least with respect to the
transtemporal understanding of the first IJPR account — that the explanation
is intrinsic to S _in the sense that_ the ‘principal explanatory mechanism’ —
transtemporal causal relations that relate the successive phases of S’s life —
is entirely contained within S’s life, that’s fine. Then premise (7) [“there
are no other internal principles from which such a substance might derive such
a tendency”] would be false, since there **is** something intrinsic to S’s
life that accounts for S’s inertial persistence — to wit, transtemporal causal
relations among the successive phases or states of S’s life.",675
"Anyway, I take the above objection targeting premise (3) to be the most
powerful. But, alas, I only came to appreciate its force after writing the
IJPR article. Nevertheless, I’ll proceed with the criticism in mind (being
careful, of course, not to fault Feser for not addressing it).",284
"Feser: “Schmid raises four objections against this argument. First, he
suggests that the defender of EIT could simply reject hylemorphism on the
grounds that, if my argument is correct, hylemorphism would conflict with EIT.
Which is true, but not terribly interesting if I have independent arguments
for hylemorphism – [as, of course, I do](https://www.amazon.com/Scholastic-
Metaphysics-A-Contemporary-
Introduction/dp/3868385444/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1391482601&sr=8-1&keywords=scholastic+metaphysics+a+contemporary+introduction).
But it wouldn’t be reasonable to expect Schmid to present a general critique
of those arguments in a journal article devoted to another topic, so for
present purposes we can put this issue to one side.”",736
"I don’t have much to say about this, apart from the fact that it **is**
important to note that the argument is only an argument against EIT
conditional on the truth of hylemoprhism, and that this need not threaten
those inertialists who reject hylemorphism. (And they’ll have responses to
what Feser has written elsewhere regarding hylemoprhism; and, of course, Feser
will have further responses; and they’ll have further responses; and so on.)",444
"Feser: “Second, Schmid notes that the Principle of Proportionate Causality (of
which premise 1 above is one formulation) allows that there are several ways
in which what is in an effect may preexist in its cause. And he suggests that
a tendency to persist in existence may preexist in a material thing’s
metaphysical constituents in a more subtle way than I consider. In particular,
he suggests that even if neither prime matter nor substantial form by
themselves have a tendency to persist in existence, maybe in combination they
will produce something that does have such a tendency – just as two colorless
chemical constituents might be combined in a way that generates something that
is red.”",696
"This is a good exposition of how I articulated the objection in my IJPR
article; however, we should note that at times in my IJPR article, I spoke of
‘a tendency’ in a metaphysically heavyweight manner, and I have explained why
I would modify this in [Part
4](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-part-4/).",358
"Feser: “One problem with this is that, just left at that, it doesn’t really
amount to much of an objection. For in the case of the chemical constituents,
there are chemical facts we can point to that explain exactly _why_ they will
together generate something red. But Schmid does not tell us _exactly what it
is_ about prime matter and substantial form that would (or indeed _could_ ),
when they are combined, generate a tendency to persist in existence.”",456
"This is **not** how the dialectical context works, though. My objection is an
**undercutting** defeater. I don’t need to _positively justify or spell out_
exactly what it is about prime matter and substantial form that would, when
combined, result in such a tendency. I need only point out that nothing Feser
says in his argument gives any reason for **ruling this out** , and that
ruling this out is what he would **need** to do for his argument to succeed.
In other words, I need only point out that Feser has not given the
hylemorphically-inclined existential ienrtialist who **does** think that the
form and matter, when combined, result in such a tendency **sufficient reason
to** ** _abandon_** **their position**. And so it is irrelevant that I don’t
specify exactly what it is about form and matter that, when combined, results
in such a tendency.",855
"Imagine we live in 1000 BC without any knowledge of the underlying chemistry
of chemical species A, B, and C. I have gone blind recently, but you haven’t.
Before going blind, I interacted a lot with A and B and know that they are
colorless liquids. But neither you nor I have combined A and B together to see
what results. Today, though, that’s gonna change. We combine A and B together
to produce C. You can see that C is a vibrant red liquid. I, of course,
cannot. You tell me it’s vibrant red. I scoff, responding with the following:",536
"“But that’s not possible. The only things from which C could derive such a
feature would be A and B, and neither of them have the feature to grant to C.
They are both colorless. And so there is simply nowhere from which C could
derive this vibrant color. You must therefore either be lying to me, or
playing a trick on me, or your visual apparatus is malfunctioning.”",367
"“But your argument there assumes that there is nothing about A and B such
that, **_when combined_** , they are able to manifest this further feature not
found in either of them individually. Think of it like wine. Wine has a flavor
none of its various constituents individually do.”",282
"“That doesn’t really amount to much of an objection! In the case of the wine,
there are facts we can point to that explain exactly _why_ they will together
generate something with a distinctively wine-like flavor. But you do not tell
us _exactly what it is_ about A and B that would (or indeed _could_ ), when
they are combined, generate this vibrant red color.”",362
"This response is confused. It is irrelevant whether you can point to facts
about A and B that illuminate why they generate redness when combined. _For_
** _I_** _was the one offering a positive argument that A and B cannot
generate redness_. And my argument **assumed** that there **couldn’t** be
anything about A and B that can combinedly manifest some feature not
individually found in either. You then pointed out that my argument **needs**
to assume this in order to succeed, but that absolutely **no** reason was
provided for such an assumption. And you pointed to a case wherein precisely
this ‘manifesting of a feature not individually found in any of the
constituents’ occurs in order to bolster the _in principle legitimacy_ of this
kind of phenomenon. My argument does nothing to rule this out in the case of
A, B, and C, and yet ruling this out is precisely what **needs** to be done
for my argument to work. So, my argument fails. And for the same reason,
Feser’s argument fails. [The case of A, B, and C is structurally identical to
the dialectic with Feser’s PPC argument.]",1087
"Feser: “Another problem is that even if substantial form and prime matter
_would_ together yield something with existential inertia, that would just
leave us with another version of the circularity problem discussed above.
Existential inertia, as a power or property of the whole substance, would
depend for its existence at any moment on the parts of the substance (prime
matter and substantial form) being combined; and the parts of the substance
being combined at any moment would depend on its power or property of
existential inertia. (As I have said before, there really is no way around
this sort of problem for anything that is composed of parts. Only an
absolutely simple or non-composite thing can have existential inertia.)”",735
"But I have already shown in [Part
5](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/09/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-vicious-circularity-and-the-metaphysics-of-eit-part-5/)
why this objection fails, and so it’s clearly false that there is no way
around this problem.",275
"Feser: “Now, toward the end of his paper, Schmid does say something that might
seem to provide a solution to this circularity problem. He says that it is the
parts of a substance _at time t – 1_ that explain the whole’s existence at
_t_. But there would be vicious circularity only if it were the parts _at time
t_ that were claimed to explain the whole’s existence at _t_.",373
"But this simply ignores the sub-argument of the Aristotelian proof, referred
to above, which claims that even considered at time _t_ , the parts of the
water (or of any other physical substance) considered _just qua parts of the
kind they are_ (particles, prime matter and substantial form, essence and
existence, or whatever) are merely potentially water, so that some additional
factor active _at t_ must be brought in to account for why they are actualized
as water at _t_. What happened at an earlier time _t – 1_ is not sufficient to
account for that. But if the additional factor is some other part of the water
itself, then we will be back with the circularity problem.”",677
"But I have already addressed Feser’s argument here in my [lengthier blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/). For one thing, I’ve already explained why the
explanatory facts adduced in each of Explanans 1 and Explanans 2 **do**
suffice to explain Explanandum, i.e., S’s existence at m. And so Feser’s claim
that past things don’t suffice is false. But for those who haven’t read my
lengthier blog post, I do want to address exactly what Feser says in his
Aristotelian proof chapter by way of justifying the explanatory insufficiency
of past things.",612
"In the Aristotelian proof chapter, all we’re offered by way of justifying the
claim that what happened prior to t is insufficient to explain why the water
exists at t, as far as I can tell, is the following passage:",215
"“[I]t is that matter’s potential to exist as _water_ that is being actualized
right now. Why? It is no good to answer that such-and-such a process occurred
at some time in the past so as to combine the hydrogen and oxygen in just the
right way. That tells us how the water _got_ here, but that is not what we are
asking about. It is also no good to point out that nothing has yet come along
to separate out the hydrogen and oxygen. That tells us how the water might
someday go out of existence, but that isn’t what we’re asking about either.
What we’re asking about, again, is what _keeps_ the water in existence at any
instant at which it does in fact exist. ” (2017, p. 26)",675
"But this amounts to simply _asserting_ that the appeal to past things is
insufficient to explain the present existence of the water; it is hardly a
_justification_ for it. The philosopher who thinks that the existence of S at
moment m is adequately explained by the conjunction of |(i) S existed
immediately before m and (ii) nothing destroyed S from then through m| will
simply say: “Au contraire; on my view, these **do** suffice to explain it.
Nothing you say in the quoted passage gives me any reason to think my
proffered explanation is inadequate. You can retort that it’s ‘no good’, but
you need to **show** why it’s no good. My view is _precisely_ one according to
which the conjunction of (i) and (ii) tells us not merely how the water got
here, and not merely how the water might go out of existence, but also _why
the water exists at m_. All you have done is simply asserted that the
conjunction of (i) and (ii) doesn’t tell us why/how the water exists at m.
_But that’s precisely my view_. And merely asserting a denial of my view is
hardly grounds for rejection of said view. And note, moreover, that the onus
in the present dialectical context is **not** on me to positively demonstrate
why (i) and (ii) suffice to explain S’s existence at m; rather, **you** are
the one giving a positive argument here, and hence **you** are the one who
needs to give **me** sufficient reason to think my view is **false**. **I** do
not, in this context, need to _positively justify_ why **my** view is
**true**. I need only point out that **you** haven’t proven it **false**.”

EIT, check out [this document
here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_r4u8vkQ_4D6HwKL-
Mkn20ieJ_i_e13O/view?usp=sharing).]",1774
"Finally, once again check out my discussion of each of Explanans 1 and
Explanans 2 from [Part
5](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/09/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-vicious-circularity-and-the-metaphysics-of-eit-part-5/),
since therein I explain how the explanatory facts cited **are** sufficient.
[Strictly speaking, though, remember that all I need to do is point out that
nothing Feser says on behalf of premise (7) gives those who **do** think past
things sufficiently explain the present existence of S sufficient reason to
**abandon** their position.]",578
"Feser: “Schmid’s third objection to my argument is directed at step 7. He says
that, for all I have shown, _existential inertia itself_ might be a further
internal principle of a substance. Hence, he claims, the premise begs the
question.",238
"To see the problem with this objection, consider an EIT-rejecting reductive
naturalist who argues as follows:",109
"_The physical world consists of nothing more than fermions and bosons and the
laws that govern them. But there is nothing in the nature of fermions and
bosons or the laws that govern them that entails that they have existential
inertia. Hence, there is no such feature in the physical world._",292
"Whatever you think of such an argument, would it beg the question? Not if the
speaker has independent grounds for being a reductive naturalist. Hence, in
response to such a reductive naturalist, a defender of EIT would either have
to give some argument against reductive naturalism, or show that the
conclusion does not follow from the premises. It would not be enough merely to
accuse the speaker of begging the question. But by the same token, my argument
does not beg the question _if_ I have independent grounds for being a
hylemorphist, which I do. Hence, even if Schmid had other good reasons to
reject the argument, accusing step 7 of begging the question is not a good
one.”",682
"Now suppose you’re an atheist and you charge me of question-begging. In
Feserian fashion, suppose I respond:",108
"“Whatever you think of such an argument, would it beg the question? Not if I
have independent grounds for being a theist. Hence, in response to such an
argument, an atheist would either have to give some argument against theism,
or show that the conclusion does not follow from the premises. It would not be
enough merely to accuse me of begging the question.”",360
"This response is confused. And yet it is precisely the response Feser has
given to my charge of question-begging. It is irrelevant whether the
**proponent** of the argument has independent reasons for accepting one of the
premises. What matters, instead, is whether the argument — its premise(s) and
that which is said on their behalf — gives those who **don’t already accept
it** sufficient reason to **abandon** their position. And the job of the
detractor of the argument is **not** to give some argument _against_ the
premise, i.e., some argument positively justifying its denial. Feser’s
response, then, fails.",615
"Feser: “Schmid’s fourth objection to my argument claims that if it succeeded,
it would take down EET as well as EIT. For why would a material substance’s
substantial form and prime matter give it a tendency to _expire_ any more than
they give it a tendency to _persist_? But Schmid’s objection misunderstands
the position of those who reject EIT and endorse EET. Their claim is not that
material substances _have_ an intrinsic tendency to _go out_ of existence.
It’s rather merely that they _lack_ any intrinsic tendency to _continue_ in
existence.",548
"Schmid considers this response, and says in reply that it presupposes that the
falsity of EIT gives us reason to believe EET, which, he claims, it does not.
But I have already explained above why he is wrong about that. The falsity of
EIT _does_ in fact give us reason to endorse EET.”",285
"And I have already explained in [Part
3](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-part-3/) why Feser is wrong here. So I won’t belabor the
point here.",198
"Feser: “Schmid also suggests that if I agree that things do not have a
positive intrinsic tendency to go out of existence, then that would be enough
to vindicate EIT. But that doesn’t follow at all. Again, the _lack_ of a
tendency to _persist_ in existence is by itself sufficient to undermine EIT.”",299
"What? This is **NOT** what I suggest. I am genuinely baffled (but not, at this
point, _surprised_ ) at this misrepresentation. (I don’t think it’s
**intentional** misrepresentation. But it’s misrepresentation nonetheless.)
Let’s see what I actually write at this stage of the paper:",282
"Notice what I **actually** claim: “So if Feser claims EET is vindicated by the
absence of a tendency to persist, it will follow that EIT is equally
vindicated by the parallel argument that things have no tendency to expire.”",224
"Now compare that sentence with what Feser **says** I claim: “if [Feser]
agree[s] that things do not have a positive intrinsic tendency to go out of
existence, then that would be enough to vindicate EIT.”",203
"These are completely different claims, and indeed I never have (and don’t)
endorse the conditional Feser attributes to me. In fact, **I explicitly deny
the conditional Feser attributes to me in the paper**. In particular, one of
my criticisms of Beaudoin’s account of EIT in the paper was precisely that the
mere absence of a tendency to expire is insufficient for EIT. That is an
explicit denial of what Feser attributes to me. See, for instance:",447
"So, Feser has blatantly misrepresented me yet again. At this point, though,
I’m not surprised.",94
"Finally, I will note, in connection with Feser’s claim that ‘the _lack_ of a
tendency to _persist_ in existence is by itself sufficient to undermine EIT’,
that this is false — I have explained many different accounts of inertial
persistence in this series that don’t ontologically commit to some (intrinsic)
tendency to persist but are still inertialist-friendly. So after
misrepresenting me, Feser made a false claim.",418
"Feser: “(Compare: If there is nothing intrinsic to me that allows me to see as
far as a mile, then I am simply not going to see as far as a mile, unless some
additional factor – such as a telescope – is brought into the picture. The
mere absence of some factor that prevents me from seeing that far – such as a
barrier – is not going to suffice for me to see that far. Similarly, the mere
absence of a positively self-destructive tendency is not going to suffice to
ensure that I continue in existence.”",503
"I had already made the exact same response to Beaudoin. And yet Feser presents
this as if it is a response to what I said. [Indeed, it **is** a response to
the claim Feser **attributed** to me, but ironically I never made that claim
and, indeed, **explicitly denied** that claim in my article.]",294
"Feser: “If there is nothing intrinsic to me that positively ensures that I do
continue in existence, then I am simply not going to continue in existence,
unless some additional factor – an external sustaining cause – is brought into
the picture.)”",247
"I have already explained why this is false. There are whole swathes of
extrinsic, inertialist-friendly explanations of persistence.",131
"Feser: “Yet as we have now seen in two detailed posts, those arguments are
seriously problematic – being sometimes unclear in their formulation, begging
the question, and, in some cases, beholden to straw men and red herrings. But
as I have said, Schmid is an intelligent fellow and he certainly tries to

"As we’ve seen in my first post and in my detailed series of responses to
Feser, my arguments are not problematic. Almost none of Feser’s responses
succeeded, and indeed they were rife with misunderstandings of the dialectical
context, misrepresentations, and missed points. But, of course, Feser is an
intelligent man and he certainly tried to engage my arguments in a serious and
civil way, and for that I thank him.",417

for me that Feser said was this:",257

it be just a *basic and necessary* feature of a world comprised of such things

arguments! Feser’s rhetorical question here just amounts to an implicit bald

intuitive that the necessity account is false, and that’s fine, but he hasn’t

existential-inertia-an-argument-against-eit-part-7/)",234
"Again, I just want all the posts in one place. So let’s get to it!",66
"This post is Part 1, which addresses Feser’s complaints about the length of
[my previous blog post
reply](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-
the-aristotelian-proof/) to his first blog post.",223
I have multiple things to say in response to Feser’s complaints.,64
"**First** , on countless occasions, there is a ‘multiple-paragraphs-to-one-
sentence correspondence’ between my response and his blog post. This is
altogether unsurprising: it takes Feser one sentence to mischaracterize one of
my points in my Sophia article as a conditional claim, or to misrepresent the
points I say on behalf of my account of per se chains, or to mistakenly allege
questions begged, or to gesture towards pages in his book where he addresses
things, or to intimate/hint/suggest that I’m behind sock puppetry. [Let me be
loud and clear: I do not claim Feser **intentionally** or **deliberately**
misrepresented me. Feser is a man with integrity, and so I am well-nigh
certain these are **unintentional** and **not deliberate**.] But it takes
multiple paragraphs to explain what’s wrong with each of these. For instance:
(a) in a case of misrepresentation (of which I documented numerous in the
previous blog post — cf. Section 3), I have to spell out exactly why it’s a
misrepresentation, what I actually said, and so on, and this requires multiple
paragraphs; (b) in a case of mistaken allegations of questions begged (of
which I documented many in the previous blog post — cf. Section 3), I have to
explain the dialectical context at hand, who has the onus of justification,
why my response, given the dialectical context, does no such thing, and so on.
Again, this takes multiple paragraphs; (c) in the case of Feser gesturing
towards pages in his book and urging that I need to respond to the arguments
therein, it takes me multiple paragraphs to explain Feser’s arguments on those
pages and then critically assess them; and (d) in the case of sock puppetry, I
have to explain why such a hypothesis is obviously wrong.",1740
"Also, as I pointed out many times in the blog post, I had already made many of
the points in a much briefer manner in my section “Dialectical Context” in the
Sophia article. But that didn’t prevent misunderstandings of the dialectical
context from arising, and so I had to step back and explain things with
concrete examples, like the example of the Even-Number-Quarkist argument.",380
"**Second** , my posts have a multiplicity of purposes. I explained in my blog
post that my aim was not merely to respond to Feser; it was also to make the
post a one-stop-shop for the breadth of criticisms of the Aristotelian proof
I’ve leveled. Different sections signal different purposes — that is well-nigh
universally understood. And I was explicit that I had one section on Feser’s
blog post. The rest were to either set the stage or to facilitate my other aim
of making my post a one-stop-shop of my criticisms of the Aristotelian proof.
Indeed, I repeatedly signal throughout my post a multiplicity of aims, only
one of which was responding to Feser. Not long after uploading the post,
moreover, I added a paragraph explaining this point:",746
"**Finally** , if Feser wants a shorter section to read whose sole aim was to
directly reply to Feser’s blog post, he can read Section 3 of my post. Therein
I point out that none of Feser’s responses to my article succeed.",221
"“Since the notion of existential inertia seems to be at the core of our
disagreement, and since I take it to be a reasonable assumption that this
article contains Schmid’s most rigorous presentation of his views on that
topic (and that his latest blog post presupposes the article in any event), I
take that to be a reasonable way to conclude our exchange for now. Fair
enough?”",378
"**First** : I don’t see this as fair. What’s fair is for Feser to read the
much shorter Section 3 of my blog post [much of which is just quoting Feser’s
blog post — I quote and respond to nearly every sentence/paragraph]. It is not
fair to ignore the fact that Feser misrepresented me on multiple occasions,
clearly misunderstood the dialectical context with his allegations of
question-begging, and so on.",406
"**Second** : It isn’t my most rigorous presentation of my views. Indeed, in my
previous blog post, I pointed out that I’ve considerably developed my views
since that paper and even disagree with [or, perhaps more accurately, would
_modify_ ] some portions of the discussion. I was a baby [well, teenage]
scholar when I wrote that paper — my first ever paper. Naturally, my views
have become much more nuanced, precise, and well-thought-out since then. In
this series, I’ll point out those modifications where and when they may arise.",533
"My most recent and rigorous articulation of my views on EIT are in two papers
under review. I’ve extracted some of the key points in the following
documents, in case anyone is interested. And no, I am not demanding that Feser
read these, and nor am I saying Feser has to read or respond to these in order
to make his case. They’re included because they are far more developed than my
IJPR paper, and they contain my actual — occurrent, present — views about EIT.
They articulate EIT under various different spacetime structures, explore a
whole host of inertialist-friendly explanations of persistence not contained
in my IJPR article, and more.",645
"Metaphysical accounts of inertial persistence are explanations of objects’
persistence that are inertialist-friendly (i.e., under which EIT is or can be
true). Here are documents wherein I develop numerous such metaphysical
accounts: (a) tendency-disposition accounts

literature [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xsCgBvADjewKqh-

"In part 2 of this series, I’ll address the next part of Feser’s post.",69
**On Presupposing EIT’s Falsity and Explaining Inertial Persistence | Part 2**,78
"This post is Part 2, which deals with some of Feser’s claims about my
characterizations of EIT and EET and more.",112
"“Arguments for God’s existence like the Aristotelian proof I defend in chapter
1 of [_Five Proofs of the Existence of God_](https://www.amazon.com/Five-
Proofs-Existence-Edward-
Feser/dp/1621641333/ref=pd_sim_14_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=JBGA9F0R86NCQBXMT2ZJ)
(and which was discussed in my previous post on Schmid) are concerned in part
to show that EIT is false and EET is true. Now, Schmid writes as if the
falsity of EIT and truth of EET are _presuppositions_ of such arguments. That
is not correct. Rather, a critique of EIT and defense of EET are _parts of_
such arguments, not undefended background _assumptions_ of such arguments.”",643
"**First** , let’s see what I actually said: “an argument one of whose premises
presupposes the falsity of P-EIT and the truth of EET” (p. 203). Here, I point
out that **one of the premises** presupposes the falsity of EIT. And that is
obviously true: premise (7) in Feser’s Aristotelian proof does not **justify**
the negation of EIT but rather merely **assumes** it. To be sure, Feser
attempts, in chapter 1 of his book, to defend this assumption and to justify
premise seven. But nowhere did I deny that. What I said was that one of the
**premises** presupposes the falsity of EIT. And this is straightforward and
obviously true. I did NOT claim that it is an ‘undefended background
assumption of the argument’. I simply said one of the **premises** assumes the
falsity of EIT. This is utterly separate from the question about _whether the
argument as a whole_ — including, of course, that which is said on behalf of
the premises in chapter 1 — unjustifiably assumes this. Thus, Feser is just
wrong and has mischaracterized my claim.",1035
"Here, I point out that one of the **premises** has the presupposition. Yes, in
the next sentence, I say ‘the argument presupposes the falsity’, but I was
intending the second sentence to be read in light of the first wherein I make
the point in a more technical manner. (Moreover, notice what I say in that
second sentence: *if* one can show that the presupposition is not adequately
justified. This shows beyond reasonable doubt that by ‘the argument’s
presupposition’ I do not _simply mean_ ‘unjustified background assumption of
the argument’. For if I did mean that, then the antecedent of the conditional
would be utterly trivial.)",635
"**Second** , ‘presupposition’ can be interpreted either as ‘assumes without
justification’ or else simply ‘requires’. Feser interprets me as saying the
former, but I don’t see any reason we should interpret me saying as much. In
fact, this is an uncharitable assumption. For I quite literally go on in the
article to examine precisely what Feser says, in his chapter and in his 2011
article, by way of justifying premise (7). It would be really strange if I
meant by ‘presupposition’ in my paper ‘an undefended background assumption of
the argument’ given that I go on to point out how the denial of EIT isn’t an
undefended background assumption of the argument. [Now, what I will say is
that I likely _should_ have written ‘requires’ instead of ‘presupposes’, since
the latter can be ambiguous. But that, of course, doesn’t excuse taking the
uncharitable reading. Moreover, the fact that I say ‘if one can show that the
presupposition is not adequately justified’ shows that I mean ‘requirement’ by
‘presupposition’, since if I instead meant ‘assumes without justification, my
antecedent would be trivial. So the uncharitable charge stands.]",1142
"So far, Feser has mischaracterized me and uncharitably read me. Off to a good
start.",84
"**Third** , let us suppose (contrary to what I’ve argued) that both of my
above two points are wrong. That is, let’s suppose that I not only applied
‘presuppose’ to the entire argument and what is said on its behalf but that I
also contradicted myself in the article by using ‘presuppose’ to mean ‘has as
an unjustified background assumption’. **Even still** , I would argue that it
**is** correct to say that the argument unjustifiably assumes the falsity of
EIT. To be sure, there is an _attempt_ at justifying it. But as I explained in
Section 3 [And section 4.1, but that is supplemental] in my [lengthy blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/), the attempt fails and still ultimately rests on a mere
assumption of EIT’s falsity. And so even if my first two points failed, I am
not incorrect, _pace_ Feser.",874
"To see why such attempts still ultimately assume (rather than properly
justify) EIT’s falsity, let’s again have a look at what Feser says in his
chapter on behalf of premise (7).",178
"Consider, for instance, that in the Aristotelian proof chapter, all we’re
offered by way of justifying the claim that what happened prior to t is
insufficient to explain why the water exists at t, as far as I can tell, is
the following passage:",244
"“[I]t is that matter’s potential to exist as _water_ that is being actualized
right now. Why? It is no good to answer that such-and-such a process occurred
at some time in the past so as to combine the hydrogen and oxygen in just the
right way. That tells us how the water _got_ here, but that is not what we are
asking about. It is also no good to point out that nothing has yet come along
to separate out the hydrogen and oxygen. That tells us how the water might
someday go out of existence, but that isn’t what we’re asking about either.
What we’re asking about, again, is what _keeps_ the water in existence at any
instant at which it does in fact exist. ” (2017, p. 26)",675
"But this amounts to simply _asserting_ that the appeal to past things is
insufficient to explain the present existence of the water; it is hardly a
_justification_ for it. The philosopher who thinks that the existence of S at
moment m is adequately explained by the conjunction of |(i) S existed
immediately before m and (ii) nothing destroyed S from then through m| will
simply say: “Au contraire; on my view, these **do** suffice to explain it.
Nothing you say in the quoted passage gives me any reason to think my
proffered explanation is inadequate. You can retort that it’s ‘no good’, but
you need to **show** why it’s no good. My view is _precisely_ one according to
which the conjunction of (i) and (ii) tells us not merely how the water got
here, and not merely how the water might go out of existence, but also _why
the water exists at m_. All you have done is simply asserted that the
conjunction of (i) and (ii) doesn’t tell us why/how the water exists at m.
_But that’s precisely my view_. And merely asserting a denial of my view is
hardly grounds for rejection of said view. And note, moreover, that the onus
in the present dialectical context is **not** on me to positively demonstrate
why (i) and (ii) suffice to explain S’s existence at m; rather, **you** are
the one giving a positive argument here, and hence **you** are the one who
needs to give **me** sufficient reason to think my view is **false**. **I** do
not, in this context, need to _positively justify_ why **my** view is
**true**. I need only point out that **you** haven’t proven it **false**.”
[For a more fleshed out discussion of transtemporal explanatory accounts of
EIT, check out [this document
here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_r4u8vkQ_4D6HwKL-
Mkn20ieJ_i_e13O/view?usp=sharing).]",1774
"Finally — and note that I do not need to do this for my criticism to succeed —
here is a plausible [to my mind at least] _positive justification_ as to why
something like (i) and (ii) **do** suffice to explain S’s existence at m. For
S to **fail** to exist at m despite existing from [m*, m), m* < m, is for some
**change** to occur.[Fn] But a change occurs only if some factor causally
induces said change. Hence, if no factor causally induces a change, then the
change won’t occur. Thus, if no factor causally induces S to fail to exist at
m despite existing from [m*, m), then S exists at m. Once we add that nothing
came along to causally induce this — that is, once we add that nothing came
along to destroy S from m* to m — it simply follows that S exists at m. [Cf.
Section 4.1 in the present blog post for more on this line of thought.]",844
"Here, we seem to have a perfectly respectable, perfectly legitimate
explanation of S’s existence at m. And this does, indeed, tell us how S exists
at m. That was a straightforward deduction of the explanatory facts cited
[namely, (i) S existed immediately before m, (ii) nothing causally induced S’s
cessation at m [i.e., nothing destroyed S from the immediately prior moment(s)
through m], and (iii) a change occurs only if some factor causally induces
said change]. And so we do, indeed, have sufficient explanation for S’s
existence at m, one that doesn’t adduce some extrinsic sustaining efficient
cause. For me at least, the explanation certainly seems to remove mystery as
to why/how S exists at m. And unlike what allegedly afflicts the explanatory
facts adduced in the quoted passage above from Feser (2017, p. 26), the
present explanation **does** , indeed, tell us how S exists at m. [I discuss
and defend EIT-friendly explanations of persistence along similar lines in
[this document
here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VJylrJ-8olSgbUUf6m0FOeSP-
RrrJJO_/view?usp=sharing) on no-change accounts. And again, Feser need not
engage with this document if he responds. I include it for those who want to
dig deeper.]",1224
"“For example, in the course of developing the Aristotelian proof, I point out
that a substance like the water in question is _composite_ in nature, i.e. it
is made up of parts. There are different ways you could conceive of these
parts – for example, in terms of substantial form and prime matter (if you are
an Aristotelian hylemorphist), or in terms of essence and existence (if you
are a Thomist metaphysician), or in terms of fundamental particles (if you are
a metaphysical naturalist). It doesn’t matter for the specific purposes of the
argument. What matters is only that the parts, considered _just qua parts of
that kind_ at _t_ , are only _potentially_ water at _t_ , and that some
additional factor is therefore needed in order to explain why this potential
is actualized at _t_. That they made up water at _t_ – 1 is irrelevant,
because what matters is why they continue to make up water at _t_ , and again,
nothing about the parts _considered by themselves_ can account for that. Hence
we need to appeal to some additional factor.”",1044
"I have already addressed a well-nigh identical [in semantic/argumentative
content] paragraph in Section 3 of my lengthier blog post. That other
paragraph of Feser’s was:",169
"“The basic idea is this. Consider a collection of particles of type _P_ which
constitute water at time _t_. Though they actually constitute water at _t_ ,
there is nothing in the particles _qua particles of type P_ that suffices to
make them water rather than one of the other alternatives mentioned. Again,
_qua particles of type P_ they have the potential to constitute water, or
separate quantities of hydrogen and oxygen, or some other substance or
aggregate of substances. So, there must at _t_ be something distinct from the
collection which actualizes its potential to be _water_ , specifically.”",603
"Now, as I pointed out in my previous blog post, there are at least three
problems with this.",92
"**First** , the implicit causal principle adduced in this paragraph is simply
not the causal principle articulated and defended in (2017, ch. 1). I actually
addressed a nearly-identical point in my original manuscript for the Sophia
article, but that manuscript was almost 11k words in total, and Sophia was
extremely strict about making the article less than 8k words. Naturally, then,
I chopped stuff, and addressing a nearly-identical point to Feser’s present
point was left on the chopping board. Nevertheless, I saved the portion of the
paper, and I shall articulate right now what I said therein.",602
"One might say that the water’s existence consists in or results from a
reduction of potency to act in the sense that some of the _essential parts_ of
water—its underlying matter, say, or its constituent molecules and atoms and
whatnot— _could be otherwise_ , such that the water _could fail to exist_. If,
for instance, the oxygen and hydrogen atoms were separated, the water wouldn’t
exist. Because the essential parts of water have the potential to be otherwise
(e.g., to make up something other than water, or to be absent from reality
altogether), it follows that the water has some potential to exist which is
realized or actualized as opposed to other potentials that aren’t realized or
actualized.",704
"But, crucially, this is _not_ the kind of ‘potency-to-act-reduction’ that
Feser needs for his argument to get off the ground. _Nowhere_ in Feser (2017,
ch. 1) does Feser justify a causal principle to the effect that ‘if there are
a range of potentials p1, p2, … pn, only one of which can be actual[ized] (at
a given time), and one of them, pi, is actual[ized] (at a given time), then
there is some (sustaining) cause which makes pi actual (at a given time).’",458
"One reason this couldn’t be the causal principle at play in the Aristotelian
proof is that it would straightforwardly debar the inference to a _purely_
actual being. For suppose that the unactualized actualizer is simply a
_necessary_ but non-purely-actual being, A. In that case, it is simply _false_
that there are a range of potentials when it comes to the very _being_ ,
_existence_ , or _actuality_ of A, since A is _necessarily actually existent_.
It thus has no potential pertaining to its very substantial being or existence
(e.g., potentials to cease to exist, to begin to exist, or to be absent from
reality altogether). Thus, if the causal principle at play in the Aristotelian
proof _were_ the one previously articulated, then the Aristotelian proof would
be incapable of justifying the need for a sustaining, actualizing cause of A.
(Why? Because the antecedent of the causal principle is simply false when it
comes to A’s very being or existence—there isn’t a range of potentials
concerning A’s very substantial existence. And so one cannot infer, solely _by
means of_ said causal principle, that A has a cause of its existence.) And if
the Aristotelian proof were incapable of justifying the need for a sustaining,
actualizing cause of A, then it simply couldn’t show that the unactualized
actualizer is _purely_ actual, since—for all the argument shows— _A_ could be
the unactualized actualizer, and A is _not purely actual_.",1441
"A second reason the aforementioned causal principle couldn’t be the one at
play in the Aristotelian proof is that it is simply not one that Feser
articulates or defends in his (2017, ch. 1). Instead, Feser argues that _any
change—any actualization of potential or reduction from potency to
act—requires a causal actualizer_ (2017, pp. 19-22). But this is crucially
different from the earlier causal principle, since the earlier makes no
reference to _change_ but instead merely to _cross-world difference_ : if one
possibility among a range of incompatible possibilities is actual, then there
must be some cause that explains why the actual possibility is, well,
_actual_. This is a stronger principle than the principle that _changes_
require causes.",751
"**Second** , the inference to the claim captured in “So…” is a non-sequitur.
[Granted, Feser is giving a _basic idea_ and so not intending to justify or
fully flesh out the relevant inferences contained therein. But registering the
problems afflicting the basic idea illustrates the work that needs to be done
in a more fleshed out formulation.] Merely from the facts that the collection
_as such_ ( _qua_ collection) does not suffice for the collection’s actually
constituting water at t, the only thing that follows is that there must be
some _other_ sufficient condition(s) for the collection’s constituting water
at t. What _doesn’t_ follow is that this other sufficient condition(s) is a
_sustaining/conserving actualizing cause_. I would argue that the only thing
needed as the other sufficient condition(s) is simply an _explanation_ of why
the collection constitutes water at t. But there are whole swathes of
explanations of why the collection constitutes water at t that don’t adduce
some outside sustaining or conserving efficient cause. I alluded to one of
them in [Part 1](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/06/feser-on-

"**Third** — and this is kinda double counting, but I deem it important enough
to separate as a distinct objection in its own right — the very causal
principle Feser implicitly adduces in the relevant passage seems to undermine
the Aristotelian proof. For the causal principle at hand — to reiterate what I
said above — would straightforwardly debar the inference to a _purely_ actual
being. For suppose that the unactualized actualizer is simply a _necessary_
but non-purely-actual being, A. In that cause, it is simply _false_ that there
are a range of potentials when it comes to the very _being_ , _existence_ , or
_actuality_ of A, since A is _necessarily actually existent_. It thus has no
potential pertaining to its very substantial being or existence (e.g.,
potentials to cease to exist, to begin to exist, or to be absent from reality
altogether). Thus, if the causal principle at play in the Aristotelian proof
_were_ the one Feser seems implicitly to adduce in the quoted passage, then
the Aristotelian proof would be incapable of justifying the need for a
sustaining, actualizing cause of A. (Why? Because the antecedent of the causal
principle is simply false when it comes to A’s very being or existence—there
isn’t a range of potentials concerning A’s very substantial existence. And so
one cannot infer, solely _by means of_ said causal principle, that A has a
cause of its existence.) And if the Aristotelian proof were incapable of
justifying the need for a sustaining, actualizing cause of A, then it simply
couldn’t show that the unactualized actualizer is _purely_ actual, since—for
all the argument shows— _A_ could be the unactualized actualizer, and A is
_not purely actual_.",1699
"Think about it this way. It was _precisely because_ the collection ( _qua_
collection) did not suffice for the collection’s actually constituting water
that — by Feser’s lights — there must be some sustaining or actualizing cause
[apart from the collection itself] of the collection’s actually existing as
[constituting] water. But this motivation for a sustaining cause is simply
irrelevant if there _is_ some fact about the entity in question ( _qua_ that
entity) that suffices for its existence. And this is precisely what I and a
whole host of other non-classical-theists [both non-theists and non-classical
theists] think is the case: the foundation of reality is one or more
fundamental, _necessarily existent_ entities with potentials for accidental
[though obviously not substantial] change. It is simply false, of such
entities, that no fact about them suffices for their existence. This is unlike
the case of the collection. Thus, even granting that the collection needs a
sustaining or conserving cause, the very motivation that led Feser to _demand_
such a sustaining cause undercuts his inference to the _pure_ actuality of the
unactualized being.",1160

EET.”",313

EET. Consider again the example of the water. If we reject EIT, Schmid thinks,
all that follows is that the water _will not of necessity continue to exist_
without a sustaining cause. But it doesn’t follow that it _will of necessity
go out of existence_ without one. It might simply _happen_ to carry on without
one.",395
"Feser is incorrect here. For it is demonstrable that the mere negation of
P-EIT does not entail the truth of EET as I spelled them out in my paper.
Let’s see why.",162
"The negation of P-EIT says that it is not necessarily the case that objects
persist in the absence of destruction.",114
"It is simply a fact of logic that the negation of P-EIT is consistent with the
following claim:",95
"CLAIM: It is possibly the case that objects persist in the absence of
destruction.",82

destruction is by itself sufficient for objects’ persistence]’ be ‘p’, then we
have:",163

"Now, it is, again, simply a fact of logic that ◊~p and ◊p are consistent.",73
"But CLAIM is not consistent with EET. CLAIM says that, possibly, the absence
of destruction is by itself sufficient for persistence. According to EET,
however, it is necessarily the case that objects cease in the absence of
sustenance, in which case it is necessarily true that the absence of
destruction is not by itself sufficient for persistence (since the object
needs to be _sustained_ in addition). This has the form of □~p. Since CLAIM
says that, possibly, the absence of destruction is by itself sufficient for
persistence, CLAIM is equivalent to: it is not necessarily the case that the
absence of destruction is not by itself sufficient for persistence. So, CLAIM
is equivalent to ~□~p. Hence, EET is □~p whereas CLAIM is ~□~p. That’s
inconsistent. Hence, CLAIM is not consistent with EET.",799
"Hence, ~P-EIT is consistent with CLAIM, but CLAIM is inconsistent with EET.
But it is a simple fact of logic that if **q is consistent r** and **r is
inconsistent with s** , then **q does not entail s**. For suppose the
antecedent of that conditional is true. Now suppose, for reductio, that q
entails s. Since s is inconsistent with r, s entails ~r. So, q entails ~r (by
transitivity of entailment). But this is to say that q and r are not
consistent. But we are supposing that q is consistent with r. Contradiction.
Hence, our assumption for reductio is false. So, q does not entail s. Hence,
from the truth of the antecedent we derived the truth of the consequent.
Hence, the conditional claim is true. Hence, if **q is consistent r** and **r
is inconsistent with s** , then **q does not entail s**.",802
"But it was shown above that ~P-EIT is consistent with CLAIM whereas CLAIM is
inconsistent with EET. So, ~P-EIT does not entail EET.",131
"So, I’ve shown that ~P-EIT does not entail EET. But Feser claimed I was wrong
in making this claim. So, Feser is wrong.",119

connection with justifying this claim, is moot (to quote Feser). But,
nevertheless, let’s consider it.",180
"Feser: “If the water continues to exist from _t_ – 1 to _t_ , then something
must account for this fact, and it will have to be something either intrinsic
to the water or extrinsic to it.”",188
"What? The claim Feser is supposed to be evaluating is my claim that **~P-EIT
does not entail EET**. Feser is here adding an **auxiliary thesis** — that
something must explain the fact that the water continues to exist. But Feser
is **NOT** supposed to be evaluating the claim that the **conjunction** of
(~P-EIT & <something must explain the fact that objects persist>) does not
entail EET. **I never claimed anything about this conjunction**. It is trivial
that you can add auxiliary theses to ~P-EIT to entail EET. No one denied that.
My claim was, instead, that **~P-EIT** does not entail EET. Feser can add an
auxiliary thesis to ~P-EIT to derive EET if he wants, but then he is obviously
not targeting my claim. And yet that is precisely what he was supposed to be
doing — he is supposed to be explaining why **my claim** is “not correct”.",844

some **change** to occur.[Fn] But a change occurs only if some factor causally
induces said change. Hence, if no factor causally induces a change, then the
change won’t occur. Thus, if no factor causally induces S to fail to exist at
m despite existing from [m*, m), then S exists at m. Once we add that nothing
came along to causally induce this — that is, once we addd that nothing came
along to destroy S from m* to m — it simply follows that S exists at m. [Cf.

cited [namely, (i) S existed immediately before m, (ii) nothing causally
induced S’s cessation at m [i.e., nothing destroyed S from the immediately
prior moment(s) through m], and (iii) a change occurs only if some factor

explanation for S’s existence at m, one that doesn’t adduce some extrinsic

to remove mystery as to why/how S exists at m. The present explanation
**does** , indeed, tell us how S exists at m. [I discuss and defend EIT-

Sufficient Reason (PSR). Well, since I think PSR is true and have defended it
at length in several places, I hardly think that is a problem. But in fact the
argument does not presuppose PSR – or to be more precise, it doesn’t
presuppose PSR any more than any other explanation does. Homicide detectives,
insurance investigators, and forensic engineers never take seriously the
suggestion “Maybe it just happened for no reason!” when considering the
phenomena they are trying to understand, and that is so whether or not they
are committed to the principle that absolutely _everything_ has an
explanation. Similarly, we needn’t appeal to such a principle in order to
judge that the rejection of EIT should lead us to embrace EET.”",799

presupposes the PSR or something like it. The criticism instead is that Feser
was **supposed** to be addressing my claim that ~P-EIT does not entail EET.
But then to address this claim, he only argued that **adding an auxiliary
hypothesis** to ~P-EIT entails EET. That wasn’t my claim, and I never denied
the trivial fact that one can add an auxiliary thesis to ~P-EIT to entail EET.",462
"One might object: isn’t your post here just pedantic and irrelevant logic-
chopping? How does any of this matter?",113
"I see it as neither pedantic nor irrelevant or insignificant. There is a
purpose behind it, and I take the purpose to be obviously significant. What is
that purpose? I’ll spell it out briefly.",192
"Remember my point: the mere fact of denying P-EIT doesn’t deliver (i.e., allow
us to derive or establish or logically infer the truth of) EET. This means
that it is not enough merely to deny P-EIT if we want to deliver or establish
EET. Feser wants to deliver or establish EET. So it is not enough for Feser
merely to deny P-EIT. So if Feser wants to succeed in delivering or
establishing EET, he must adduce and defend some philosophically substantive
auxiliary thesis or theses added to the denial of P-EIT. This is quite clearly
a significant result, one that some may not have seen originally and one that
some may have thought unnecessary. [Some may have thought it would be enough
merely to reject P-EIT.]",711
"And this discovery especially helps us focus precisely on those substantive
auxiliary theses and whether or not they are true/defensible. And that’s
precisely what I went on to do with Feser’s proffered auxiliary theses: one of
Feser’s theses was a PSR or PSR-like explanatory principle, which I accept;
but another one of his theses was that if there is no sustaining cause, then
there is no extrinsic explanation. And I argued against this. Nothing is
pedantic or irrelevant here. It is a significant point that some
philosophically substantive auxiliary thesis or theses needs to be conjoined
to a mere denial of P-EIT to deliver EET. It helps us see connections between
ideas, clears up the dialectical context [i.e., helps us see what one needs to
do if one wants to establish EET], allows us to identify the dialectical role
the auxiliary theses play and what they need to add to ~P-EIT to deliver EET,
and finally sets the stage for and facilitates our focus on such auxiliary
theses. Nothing pedantic or irrelevant here.",1028

presumption in its favor, so that we ought initially to be agnostic about
which is correct. _A priori_ , they are evenly matched.”",205
"This is one part of my paper that I have come to disagree with. For I now
think EIT is **far better** than EET when it comes to prior or intrinsic
probability [or _a priori plausibility_ , to use Feser’s phrase — one I’m
happy to use]. One key determinant of prior/intrinsic probability is
simplicity. And unless I have overlooked something, it is clearly true that
EIT is simpler than EET. For one thing, EET requires a categorically different
kind of causation in our ontology [namely, sustaining causation]. EIT does not
by itself require this. For another thing, EET is going to require a
categorically different kind of being in our ontology [assuming, as I take to
be innocuous in this dialectical context, the impossibility of infinitely
descending per se chains of causal dependence]. In particular, EET is going to
require there to be at least one timeless being that sustains temporal things
in existence. EET is thus committed not only to all the temporal entities EIT
is committed to, but it also includes more entities (a timeless entity), more
kinds of causation (sustenance or conservation from without, as well as
timeless-to-temporal causation), and more fundamental [i.e. not-reducible-to-
other] kinds of entities (reality is fundamentally divided at least into
timeless/immutable concrete things and temporal/immutable concrete things),
and so on. This makes EET much more complex than EIT and hence much less
intrinsically probable. [Fn]",1458
"I also want to pinpoint another way in which I would modify the IJPR paper. In
particular, I say therein that “Consider again P-EIT and EET. In particular,
notice that they exactly parallel one another. Their ontological commitments
are exactly parallel (each committed to a particular kind of tendency within
temporal objects)”. This, I don’t think, is right. First, I seem to speak in
this passage as if a ‘tendency’ is some metaphysically heavyweight thing, such
as a dispositional property of something. But that is a commitment of neither
P-EIT nor EET. In particular, they can both be read in ways that don’t
ontologically commit to some ‘tendency’ — this can be read in a metaphysically
lightweight way. [For those interested, cf. my discussion of [tendency-
disposition accounts
here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j1xevd_Z8YlOoLj__8nom-

two theses have the same commitments. As I showed in the previous paragraph,
_EET has many, many more commitments_. In any case, my
modifications/corrections only strengthen my paper’s case.",1116
"[Fn] Note that when philosophers speak of fundamental kinds of things in the
context of theoretical virtue comparison, they simply mean kinds of things
that are not analyzable in terms of or reducible to other kinds of things.
This is a separate issue from one such fundamental kind of thing [e.g.
temporal things] standing in a causal dependence relation to another such
fundamental kind of thing [e.g., a timeless thing or things].",433

"Feser: “This too, I would argue, is mistaken. To take an example I have often
used, suppose you explain, to someone who has never heard of them before (a
young child, say), the nature or essence of a lion, of a Tyrannosaurus Rex,
and of a unicorn. Then you tell him that, of these three animals, one exists,
one used to exist but has gone extinct, and the other never existed and is
fictional. You ask him to tell you, based on his new knowledge of the essences
of each, which is which. Naturally, he couldn’t tell you. For there is nothing
in the essence or nature of these things that could, by itself, tell you
whether or not it exists. Existence is something _additional to_ the essence
of a contingent thing. It doesn’t follow from such a thing’s essence.”",761
"Suppose I grant this. All the child should conclude is that — precisely
because there is nothing about a contingent thing [or its nature] that tells
us whether it exists — there must be some other factor that explains why the
contingent thing exists. In other words, we need some reason why the
contingent thing is in reality at all. But this, of course, is an entirely
separate question from why, _once in existence_ , the thing _continues to
exist_.",451
"And, indeed, I would argue that the _a priori_ considerations strongly favor
EIT. Consider this dialogue between me and the child from earlier.",143
"**Joe** : Suppose something S exists immediately before a given moment m. Now,
for S to fail to exist at m despite existing immediately before m is for some
kind of change to occur. Of course, it’s not as though S undergoes some change
in this process, since S doesn’t become something different. But still, there
is some kind of change here, whether in the ontological inventory of what
there is, or whether in the incorporation of what were previously S’s parts
into parts of something else, or whether in the passing away of a state, or
whatever. [See Section 4.1.2
[here](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-
the-aristotelian-proof/) for more on this objection.]",698
"**Joe** : But changes of state (i.e., cases where some new state comes to be
or some old state passes away) plausibly require some cause. It’s not as
though a raging tiger could just spring into existence in this room right now;
that would require some cause.",259
"**Joe** : So, if there is no cause that induces the relevant change of state,
then there won’t be such a change.",112
"**Joe** : So, if there is no cause that induces S to cease to exist at m —
that is, if there is nothing that comes along to destroy S — then S will not
cease to exist at m. And in that case, S will persist to m. For you granted
earlier that S’s failing to exist m despite existing before m constitutes some
kind of change. In particular, it’s a change of state in the sense of an old
state passing away. And in that case, we get the conclusion that so long as
nothing destroys S from immediately before m through m, then S will exist at
m. We derived this in a manner that removes mystery as to why and how S exists
at m.",621
"In this (obviously gerrymandered) conversation, we have a seemingly perfectly
illuminating inertialist-friendly explanation of why S exists at m once S is
in existence. The explanation tells us precisely how and why S exists at m.
And whether or not existence follows from what a contingent thing is is not
relevant to this point.",330
"Feser: “This is, of course, an argument Aquinas gives for the Thomistic
doctrine of the real distinction between essence and existence (which I
develop and defend in chapter 4 of _Five Proofs_ ). The point for the moment
is this. If nothing about the essence or nature of a thing entails that it
_exists at all_ in the first place, then it is hard to see how anything about
its essence or nature could entail that will _persist in existence_ once it
does exist.”",462
"Maybe so. But nothing in the exchange above, for instance, assumes that it was
something about the essence or nature of the contingent thing which explains
why the object persists. Totally separate explanatory facts were cited. And so
this point doesn’t support the denial of EIT, which is what it would need to
do in order for Feser to substantiate his claim that EET is better off than
EIT in terms of their ‘a priori matchup’ (as it were).",442
"Feser: “In short, the very nature of a contingent thing qua contingent makes
it implausible to attribute to it a feature like existential inertia. In which
case, EET is, contra Schmid, _a priori_ more plausible than EIT.”",221
"I have already shown why this is mistaken. First, none of the explanatory
facts cited in my conversation with the child involved facts about the essence
or nature of a contingent thing explaining why it persists. And there are
whole swathes of inertialist-friendly explanations of persistence, as we saw
in previous posts in this series, that likewise make no appeal to the nature
of contingent things. I have also already explained why existential inertia
isn’t a ‘feature’ or ‘attribute’ of things in Section 3 of [my lengthier blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/). (And even those who accept a tendency-based account of
EIT where things have the tendency by nature [cf. [some tendency-disposition
accounts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j1xevd_Z8YlOoLj__8nom-
dgaObTnRV8/view?usp=sharing)] should not be convinced by what Feser says. They
will simply say ‘if you leave off a tendency to persist in your description of
their essences, then you have simply given the child an incomplete
description’.)",1073
"Finally, suppose — contrary to what I argued — that Feser did show or render
plausible the claim that contingent things do not enjoy existential inertia.
As I point out in a footnote of my IJPR paper and explain in more detail in
Section 4.1 of [my lengthier blog
pos](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/)t, in principle EIT (or _an_ EIT) can quantify over a
_subset_ of temporal concrete objects. And so the inertialist may very well
hold that contingent things uniformly fail to enjoy inertial persistence, but
that there is nevertheless some foundational necessarily existent temporal
concrete object or objects upon which non-foundational contingent concrete
objects depend. (Theist-friendly examples include the neo-classical or
panentheistic temporal God, while non-theist-friendly examples include one or
more foundational quantum fields, or a spatiotemporal wavefunction [cf.
Section 4.3.8 of [my lengthier blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/)], or a collection of fundamental particles, what have
you.] In this case, it is _false_ that nothing about the necessary foundation
demands its existence or its persistence; indeed, the opposite is true. Hence,
even if — contrary to what I argued — Feser’s argument succeeds, the
inertialist can still maintain a version of EIT. (To be sure, Feser might try
to adduce other arguments claiming that only the classical theistic God could
be necessarily existent. But that is a separate argument from the one under
present consideration, and my sole purpose here is to point out that the the
argument under present consideration need not move an inertialist to abandon
their position. And there’s also the fact that there are responses to such
arguments that, by my lights at least, succeed.)",1866
"Feser: “In summary, then, in the first, stage-setting part of his paper,
Schmid makes three dubious claims: that the falsity of EIT and truth of EET
are simply taken for granted by the Aristotelian proof (not true);”",216
"Let’s also summarize: in Feser’s assessment of the stage-setting part of my
paper, he both mischaracterized and read uncharitably what I said about the
presupposition of EIT, and even if he didn’t, my point still stands [cf. [Part
2](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/06/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-part-2/)]. So his first point here is simply false.",374
"Feser: “that the falsity of EIT does not give us reason to believe EET (not
true);”",83
"And I already addressed Feser’s allegations in this regard in [Part
3](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-part-3/), showing that they don’t work. Hence, Feser is
wrong to claim that what I said here is false.",262
"(I am assuming that by ‘does not give us reason’, Feser means ‘does not give
us **adequate** reason’ (instead of meaning ‘does not give us **any**
reason’), since nowhere did I say that the negation of P-EIT does not give us
**any** reason to believe EET.)",256
Feser: “and that EIT and EET are equally plausible _a priori_ (not true).”,74
"I have already shown why Feser’s responses to my claim here fail. See the
paragraphs above. But Feser is (accidentally) right here — my claim that
they’re equally plausible _a priori_ is not true. As I explained above, EIT is
_much more plausible_ than EET _a priori_!",268
"Feser: “So unpromising a beginning does not portend well for the rest of the
paper, and indeed further serious problems with it arise immediately.”",147
"And an unpromising beginning to Feser’s blog post, rife as it was with false
claims and misrepresentation, does not portend well for the rest of his blog
post, and indeed further serious problems with it arise immediately — problems
to which I will turn in Part 5 of this series.",279
"This post is Part 5, which deals with everything Feser says on the metaphysics
of existential inertia. There are only two more installments of the series
left: Part 6, which deals with everything Feser says in his section
“Theoretical vices”, and Part 7, which addresses everything Feser says in his
section ‘An argument against EIT’.",334
"Feser writes: “Schmid next considers two possible ways of spelling out EIT.
The first account goes like this: Consider the water in our earlier example.
Its existence at some time _t_ is sufficiently explained by (a) the state and
existence of the water at an immediately preceding time _t_ – 1 together with
(b) the absence of anything acting to destroy the water.”",366
"This first account of EIT is another aspect of the paper I would modify. When
I wrote the paper, I wanted to leave this first account open between (what I
have more recently termed) ‘[transtemporal
accounts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_r4u8vkQ_4D6HwKL-
Mkn20ieJ_i_e13O/view?usp=sharing)’ and ‘[no-change
accounts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VJylrJ-8olSgbUUf6m0FOeSP-
RrrJJO_/view?usp=sharing)’ (cf. those links for more detailed
characterization). Both of these accounts cite at least one fact about past
things to explain the present existence of the water. Naturally, then, I
thought they could both fall under my first account in the IJPR paper, since
they both — at least under one way to articulate them — appeal to the moment
immediately before the present moment as part of the explanation of the
present existence of an object. But I have now come to see that this was a
mistake, since transtemporal and no-change accounts of EIT — while unified by
such an appeal — are nevertheless fundamentally different kinds of
explanations. The result is that my IJPR’s first account can be read in either
transtemporal-account terms or no-change-account terms, and this makes things
difficult (as all ambiguities do). So, let me tease out these two different
ways of understanding the first IJPR account.",1314
"On a transtemporal understanding of the first IJPR account, some kind of
transtemporal relation(s) to explain persistence. In the paper, I leave open
the precise nature of the relevant transtemporal explanatory relation,
allowing the relation to be either causal or non-causal. According to this
understanding of the first IJPR account, then, temporal concrete object S’s
persistence is explained by (i) the absence of sufficiently causally
destructive factors operative on S, plus (ii) transtemporal explanatory
relations (causal or otherwise) obtaining between the temporally successive
states of S’s life (so to speak).",622
"Now, for the sake of concreteness, let’s stipulate that the relation at play
is causation. Moreover — again for the sake of concreteness — let’s stipulate
that time is discrete and so composed of smallest units. Let’s call these
smallest units of time _moments_. Thus, a transtemporal understanding of the
first IJPR account says that S’s existence at moment m is explained by (i) the
absence of sufficiently causally destructive factors operative on S from (m-1)
to m [where (m-1) is the moment immediately prior to m], plus (ii) S’s state
and/or existence at (m-1) causally producing S’s existence at m (and perhaps
state at m). An explanation for S’s persistence _simpliciter_ through a series
of moments will come by way of the application of this explanatory schema to
each non-first moment m of S’s existence in the series of moments.",840
"That, then, is the transtemporal understanding of the first IJPR account that
we’ll work with. Now let’s consider the no-change understanding of the first
IJPR account.",168
"In general, no-change accounts of EIT view persistence as an absence of change
and take this fact to be central to their inertialist-friendly explanation of
persistence. The no-change account we’ll consider here is one I’ve mentioned
both in this series of responses to Feser and in Section 3 of my [lengthier
response to Feser](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-
schmid-on-the-aristotelian-proof/). Here’s how it goes.",443
"For S to **fail** to exist at m despite existing at (m-1) is for some
**change** to occur.[Fn] But a change occurs only if some factor causally
induces said change. Hence, if no factor causally induces a change, then the
change won’t occur. Thus, if no factor causally induces S to fail to exist at
m despite existing at (m-1), then S exists at m. Once we add that nothing came
along to causally induce this — that is, once we add that nothing came along
to destroy S from (m-1) to m — it simply follows that S exists at m. [Cf.
Section 4.1 in the[ lengthier blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/) for those interested in pursuing this line of thought
even further.]",732
"Here, we seem to have a perfectly respectable, perfectly legitimate
explanation of S’s existence at m — and the explanation does, indeed, tell us
how S exists at m. That was a straightforward deduction of the explanatory
facts cited [namely, (i) S existed immediately before m [to wit, at (m-1)],
(ii) nothing causally induced S’s cessation at (m-1) or m [i.e., nothing
destroyed S from the immediately prior moment, (m-1), through m], and (iii) a
change occurs only if some factor causally induces said change]. And so we do,
indeed, have sufficient explanation for S’s existence at m. For me at least,
the explanation certainly seems to remove mystery as to why/how S exists at m.
The present explanation **does** , indeed, tell us how S exists at m.",752
"[Fn] I addressed an objection to this argument [or, rather, _explanatory
schema_ ] based on the claim that cessation isn’t a change in [Section 4.1.2

search “4.1.2”.",340
"To be sure, the disambiguation above — that between transtemporal and no-
change understandings of the first IJPR account — is not found in the IJPR
article. That’s why I said, at the beginning, that this is an aspect of the
IJPR paper I would _modify_. Of course, Feser is not responsible (and nor will
I take him to be, as we proceed in this post) for ignoring this
disambiguation. But given that this disambiguation represents my current,
actual views on the IJPR paper, I will proceed in my analysis of what Feser
says with the disambiguation in mind. (It would be unreasonable, of course,
for one to demand that I defend the non-disambiguated-version from the IJPR
paper if I _disagree_ with its being non-disambiguated in the manner it was!)",747
"Let’s pick back up, then, with what Feser says: “Now, an objection that might
be raised against existential inertia thus understood (and one I have raised
in my exchanges with Graham Oppy and in my previous reply to Schmid) is that
it is viciously circular. Existential inertia would be a property or power of
the water. So, the water’s persistence from _t_ – 1 to _t_ would, on this
account, depend on this property or power. But properties and powers depend
for their reality on the substances that possess them. So, we seem to have a
situation where the water’s persistence depends on that of a property or power
which in turn depends on the persistence of the water.”",671
"I have responded to this circularity objection in Section 3 of my [lengthier
blog post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-
on-the-aristotelian-proof/), but I will also address it here.",215
"First, neither my transtemporal understanding nor my no-change understanding
of the first IJPR account entail that inertial persistence is a property or
power. Both of the accounts could, for instance, be perfectly acceptable to
philosophers of an anti-realist bent who think there are no such things as
properties or powers. There is simply nothing in the articulations above that
entail EI’s being a property or power.",420
"Second, in order for Feser’s circularity argument to work, the two
articulations must cite explanatory facts that presuppose the (explanatorily
or ontologically) prior obtaining the relevant explanandum. But that is simply
untrue, as I will now show.",250
"In the case of the transtemporal understanding of the first IJPR account, we
have:",82
"**Explanans 1** : (i) there is an absence of sufficiently causally destructive
factors operative on S from (m-1) to m [where (m-1) is the moment immediately
prior to m], and (ii) the state and/or existence of temporal concrete objects
(or, at least, those within EIT’s quantificational domain) at a given moment
(m-1) at which they exist causally produce their existence at the next moment,
m, provided that no sufficiently causally _destructive_ factors are operative.",469
"In the case of the no-change understanding of the first IJPR account, we have:",78
"**Explanans 2** : (i) S existed immediately before m — that is, at (m-1) —
(ii) if S existed immediately before m but fails to exist at m, then S’s
cessation is (or involves, or entails) some kind of change, (iii) nothing
causally induces S’s cessation at (m-1) or m — that is, nothing destroyed S
from the immediately prior moment, (m-1), through m — and (iv) a change occurs
only if some factor causally induces said change.",426
"Now, I think it’s quite clear that neither Explanans 1 nor Explanans 2
presuppose the prior reality or obtaining of Explanandum. In other words, none
of the explanatory facts adduced in Explanans 1 or Explanans 2 are dependent
upon the fact cited in the Explanandum. And in that case, Feser’s allegation
of viciously circular (explanatory) dependence has no teeth against the
transtemporal and no-change understandings of the first IJPR account. It is
simply false, of both of these understandings, that there is some property or
power that both _explains_ and is explained _by_ some fact.",589
"[Keep in mind, moreover, that there are many more inertialist-friendly
explanations besides, and that these, too, do not fall prey to charges of
vicious circularity. Cf. the various documents I linked in Section 2.2 of my
[lengthier blog post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-
on-schmid-on-the-aristotelian-proof/).]",339
"So far I’ve offered two responses to the vicious circularity charge. First,
neither of the understandings of the first IJPR account treat (or entail that)
inertial persistence is a property or power. Second, the explanations
proffered in neither of the understandings are viciously circular. Here’s a
third response to the vicious circularity charge. Suppose — contrary to what I
believe — that existential inertia were a property. This would only be
problematic if we accepted the controversial thesis that properties ground
character — that is, it is in virtue of possessing/exemplifying/instantiating
(say) the property _redness_ that something is red. But suppose we reject this
thesis and adopt its opposite: it is rather in virtue of being red that
something possesses/etc. the property _redness_. Under this anti-character-
grounding view, it is simply false — _pace_ Feser — that existential inertia’s
being a property entails that the water exists at m [or persists from (m-1) to
m] because it has the property of existential inertia. Rather, the substance
has the property of existential inertia because it exists at m [or persists
from (m-1) to m] in an inertial fashion. So _even if_ existential inertia were
a property [it’s not], Feser’s argument still won’t work.",1278
"One of my friends [Luiz] suggested to me a fourth response to Feser’s
argument. Luiz argues that it is _false_ that all properties of a substance
inhere in the substance and have an asymmetric dependence relation to the
substance. And in that case, one of Feser’s key claims — that properties
depend for their reality on the substances that possess them — is false. (Or,
at least, I assume Feser is saying that this applies to _all_ properties. For
if it only applies to _some_ properties, then his argument would be invalid
[this is invalid: (1) EI is a property; (2) _some_ properties depend on
substances [i.e., the substances that have them]; (3) Therefore, EI depends on
substances.)",688
"Luiz gives examples of properties of substances that don’t depend thereon.
(Or, at least, examples that would be kosher by the lights of our
Aristotelian-Thomistic friends.) These include what Aristotle calls secondary
substances (species, genera) and specific differences (essential properties)
as well as transcendental properties (being, unity, goodness, truth) which
cannot depend upon the substance that possesses them in the same asymmetric
way an accident is.",466
"In any case, I’m still reflecting on Luiz’s argument as a fourth response. I
offer it here because I see value in it and because you might too.",143
"Feser: “Schmid considers something like this “circularity” objection (though
his exposition of it seems to me to be quite murky, so it is possible that he
has something else in mind). In response to it, he says that if the objection
had any force, it would have force against _any_ account of the persistence of
the water, including an account that attributes its persistence to God. For if
we suppose that God causes the water to persist from _t_ – 1 to _t_ , then we
will be _presupposing_ that it is possible for it to persist from _t_ – 1 to
_t_ , and thus won’t be giving a non-circular _explanation_ of how it is
possible for it to do so. And if the theist replies that God gives the water
the ability to persist, then this will only push the problem back a stage
insofar as it will presuppose that God has the ability to do so.”",835
"I find this to be a very odd response, and I confess that I’m not sure I even
understand what Schmid is going on about. The circularity objection has
nothing do with presupposing that it is possible for something to persist, or
with presupposing that things have abilities, or anything like whatever Schmid
is talking about. Rather, it has to do with the fact that properties and
powers are ontologically dependent on substances, so that substances cannot
without circularity be said to be ontologically dependent on properties or
powers.",538
"Again, perhaps that is _not_ the objection Schmid is talking about. But if it
isn’t, then I’m not sure what he _is_ talking about. Certainly he doesn’t seem
to be talking about (a) an objection that any critic of EIT has actually
given, or (b) an objection that is interesting.”",278
"Oddly, Feser says “Certainly [Schmid] doesn’t seem to be talking about (a) an
objection that any critic of EIT has actually given, or (b) an objection that
is interesting.”",172
"First, I never claimed any critic of EIT has given this in the literature. But
I **did** receive _precisely this objection_ from those critical of the
account in question. (I wrote the paper years ago, and so I don’t remember who
precisely raised the objection to me. In all probability, it was an anonymous
referee.) And Feser’s finding it uninteresting is itself uninteresting and
irrelevant, since it was an objection I received and needed to deal with.",456
"Moreover, I don’t find the objection I was considering in the paper murky at
all, and nor did the reviewers of the paper or other philosophers [e.g. Josh
Rasmussen] I’ve discussed it with. But I guess I can try to explain it in a
clearer way here for Feser and those who find it murky.",285
"For starters, the objection I was considering is _not_ the circularity
objection Feser raises in the blog post and to which I responded above, and so
it is irrelevant for Feser to point out that the objection I was considering
‘has nothing do’ with his objection. The correct response is ‘And? I wasn’t
addressing your objection here.’",335
"To get a better sense of the objection, let’s have a look at the paper:",71
"The objection is that the explanans [the immediately temporally prior state
and existence of O plus nothing intervening between that prior moment and the
present moment] cannot _explain_ the present existence of O ( _pace_ the
account) — that is, it cannot _explain_ the persistence of O from that
immediately prior moment to the present moment — since it merely presupposes
that O has the ability to persist from that prior state to the present state.
But surely it was precisely this ability to persist that was trying to be
explained!",537
"My response was that it is **not** ( _pace_ the objection) the _ability_ of O
to persist that was trying to be explained. Rather, it is _O’s actually
persisting_ that is trying to be explained. So my response was that the
objection under consideration mischaracterizes the explanandum. I then went on
to circumvent an objection that was next leveled to me [after making the above
response]: but doesn’t O’s _actually_ persisting _itself_ presuppose O’s
_ability_ to persist, i.e., the _possibility_ that O persists? To circumvent
this, I pointed out that _any_ explanation of persistence will, of course,
presuppose the _possibility_ that O persists — after all, if it’s impossible
that O persist, then clearly there won’t be any true explanation of O’s
persistence. So yes, my account does presuppose the possibility that O
persists, but this is not a problem for the account. What matters is whether
or not the account presupposes the _actual_ persistence of O. And I proceeded
to point out that it _doesn’t_ ; instead, it provides a _means by which_ such
actual persistence is secured.",1088
"I don’t see anything murky here. It’s a perfectly natural dialectic, with a
clear objection and rejoinder, responding to a natural-but-ultimately-
misguided objection I had received.",182
"Feser: “Anyway, Schmid goes on to discuss a further possible objection to this
first way of spelling out EIT, one grounded in a presentist theory of time.
The objection would be that what happens at _t_ – 1 cannot explain what
happens at the present moment t, because (according to presentism) past
moments like _t_ – 1 no longer exist, and what does not exist cannot be the
explanation of anything. Schmid responds to this possible objection by setting
out several arguments in defense of the claim that past events can play a role
in explaining present ones.",560
"Schmid does not attribute this objection to anyone, and as he rightly notes,
presentists in fact do _not_ in general claim in the first place that past
events play no role in explaining the present. So what is the point of
devoting several pages to an argument no presentist has given or is likely to
give? I’m not sure, and I don’t myself have anything to add to what Schmid
says in response to it.”",400
"It’s not hard to think of an obvious purpose that justifies its inclusion:
_maybe I received the objection from someone critical of the account_. And
that is precisely what happened. (Once more, I don’t remember who it was, as
this all happened years ago. But once more, in all probability, it was an
anonymous referee.)",320
"Feser: “Certainly the fact that the past is relevant to explaining the present
gives (contrary to what Schmid seems to think) no support to EIT.”",145
"This is odd. To my knowledge, nowhere do I claim in the article that the
explanatory efficacy of past things _supports_ EIT. My goal in sketching the
account, there, is to point out that _one metaphysical account_ of EIT says
that past things _are_ sufficient to explain present things. I wasn’t trying
to _support_ [i.e., positively justify] the account in talking about the
explanatory efficacy of past things. Rather, I was first and foremost
responding to an objection I had received that denied this, and secondly I was
using it to set up my **_undercutting_** defeater for premise (7) of the
Aristotelian proof.",617
"‘All I need to do is point out that _nothing in premise (7) or that which is
said on its behalf_ gives those who **do** think past things suffice to
explain present things sufficient reason to _abandon_ their position. I do not
need to _positively justify_ why past things **do** suffice to explain present
things. I need only point out that nothing said in premise (7) or on its
behalf gives those who accept the explanatory sufficiency of past things
adequate reason to abandon their position. And here’s something that seems to
bolster this undercutting defeater: we know that past things can and do
legitimately explain, at least in part, present things. Given this, why should
someone who thinks this **suffices** be moved to postulate something _in
addition_?’",766
What I write about this in the article is as follows:,53
"In fairness to those who think <Joe claims that the arguments Joe gives
_positively justify or support_ the thesis that past things _suffice_ to
explain present things>, in the passage above I did not distinguish between
‘sufficiently explain’ and ‘explain at least in part’, and I certainly
**should** have. For I am intending here to point out that past things can and
do legitimately explain, _at least in part_ , present things. For purposes of
clarity, I should have included this. But it is still true that I reference,
in the sentence, ‘the above arguments’. And so my conclusion here — a
conclusion of those arguments — is supposed to be drawn precisely from those
arguments. And as we inspect the arguments, it is clear that I mean that past
things can and do explain, at least in (large) part, present things. E.g., I
say therein that “although our _experience_ of an object temporally lags
behind the object itself, the object itself nevertheless _explains_ our
experience. And this, in turn, entails that earlier states explain later
states.” But here I clearly don’t mean that the object _sufficiently_ explains
our experience. A _sufficient_ explanation of my experience also clearly needs
to cite a functioning visual and neurophysiological apparatus, and so on.",1277
"Feser: “For what is at issue in the debate over EIT and EET is not whether
what happens at _t_ – 1 is _part of_ the explanation of what is true of the
water at _t_ , but rather whether it is by itself _sufficient_ to explain what
is true of it at _t_.”",252
"It is true that this is part of what’s at issue in the debate over EIT and
EET, but we also have to be clear about the burden of proof in the present
dialectical context. In particular, we must remember that in the dialectical
context of the IJPR paper [namely, the Aristotelian proof and whether one can
“sufficiently **undercut** the argument” (p. 203 of my paper, emphasis added)
by showing that its rejection of EIT “is not adequately justified” (ibid.)],
**Feser** is the one offering a _positive argument_ one of whose premises
requires that what happened prior to t is **not** sufficient to explain the
water’s existence at t. By contrast, in spelling out my first account of EIT
and in leveling my overarching EIT-based **undercutting** defeater of premise
(7), I do **not** take a stance on whether or not what happened prior to t is
by itself sufficient to explain the water’s existence at t. [Yes, _according
to the first account_ , it **is** sufficient to explain it. But I don’t
positively claim, in the article, that the first account is true. I sketched
it to facilitate the overarching EIT-based undercutting defeater of the
Aristotelian proof.] Rather, my aim is to point out that nothing in premise
(7) or what Feser says on its behalf gives those who **do** think ‘what
happened prior to t is sufficient to explain the water’s existence at t’ —
that is, those who **do** accept the first IJPR account — sufficient reason to
_abandon_ their view. The onus is thus not on _me_ to give _positive reasons_
for thinking what happened prior to t _is_ sufficient to explain the water’s
existence at t. Rather, all I need to do is point out that (i) in order for
Feser’s proof to succeed, he needs to positively show that what happened prior
to t is _not_ sufficient for the water to exist at t, and that (ii) he has not
succeeded in showing this. And so we must keep in mind that it is no mark
against my paper or my case that I don’t positively justify the first IJPR
account, i.e., that I don’t positively justify that past things **do** suffice
to explain the present existence of something.",2106
"[Fn] To be sure, I **do** go on to mount some reasons favoring EIT in the
theoretical virtues section of the paper. But this is simply meant to bolster
and strengthen my EIT-based undercutting defeater. I had already explained the
undercutting nature of my overall thesis in the stage-setting bit of my paper
[e.g., I was seeking to “sufficiently **undercut** the argument” (p. 20e,
emphasis added) by arguing that its rejection of EIT “is not adequately
justified” (ibid.).",474
"In short, I want us all to keep in mind the dialectical context: detractors of
the Aristotelian proof **don’t need** to _positively justify or establish_
that what happened prior to t **is** sufficient to explain the water’s
existence at t. They only need to point out that the **Aristotelian proof**
fails to justify why they **aren’t** sufficient.",349
"I have argued in this blog post, Section 3 of my [lengthier blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/), and [Part
2](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/06/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-part-2/) that at least with the no-change understanding of
the first IJPR account, the explanatory facts adduced **are** , indeed,
**sufficient**. Indeed, if by ‘sufficient explanation’ we mean an explanation
citing facts that remove mystery as to why the explanandum obtains, then I
confess that — by my lights — the no-change understanding certainly removes
mystery [for me, at least] as to why and how S exists at m. The explanandum
was simply derived from the explanatory facts cited, and to me at least, they
illuminate precisely why S exists at m. And I also confess that the same is
true [again, by my lights] with the transtemporal understanding of the first
IJPR account. By examining Explanans 1 from earlier, once more S’s existence
at m is simply derived from the explanatory facts adduced. And those facts
certainly do seem, to me, to remove mystery as to why S exists at m.",1155
"To be sure, there might be the further question about why some of those
explanatory facts _themselves_ obtain. For instance, there might be the
question as to why reality is so constituted that the successive stages in an
object’s life are related by causal relations. But this is a _separate
question_ from why S exists at m. And, plausibly, it won’t be all that
difficult to provide plausible stories for the former question. [Indeed, it’s
not clear why explaining it would be any more difficult than explaining why
reality is so constituted so as to have any causal relations at all (ever), or
is so constituted so as to have causal relations other than those relating the
successive stages of an object’s life, or what have you.] Finally, to quote
Beaudoin, “it is not a condition on legitimate explanation that a deeper
explanation for every statement in the explanans always be ready to hand, or
even that it exist at all” (2007, p. 89).",943
"Feser: “(I have to say that I wonder what kind of rhetorical effect this kind
of stuff has on Schmid’s readers, some of whom – judging from my combox – seem
very impressed by it. Schmid’s discussion of this first interpretation of EIT
occupies almost five pages of analysis, with the standard bells and whistles
that we analytic philosophers pick up in grad school and from reading academic
journal articles – semi-formal formulations, the entertaining of various
hypotheticals, and so on. Other things Schmid has written, such as the article
addressed in my previous post on Schmid, have a similar character. Untutored
readers, especially those whose knowledge of philosophy is largely drawn from
blog posts, Reddit discussions, and the like, are bound to think: “Wow, this
is so technical and rigorous!” Yet in fact the analysis is sometimes not
terribly clear, and in this case it is devoted to criticizing claims that _no
critic of EIT has actually made or is likely to make in the first place!_ So
it seems to me that some of the rigor is specious.)”",1055
"I have already addressed the allegation that the analysis is not terribly
clear. To be sure, I can’t stop Feser from finding it murky. But I can at
least report that neither I myself, nor the referees of the paper, nor
philosophers and other colleagues I’ve conversed with about the matter, found
it murky. I have also already addressed Feser’s claim that “no critic of EIT
has actually made” these criticisms “or is likely to make [them] in the first
place”. Apparently addressing actual criticisms I received [in all
probability, from reviewers] hasn’t crossed Feser’s mind as a plausible
explanation of why it’s included. And so I take his allegations here to be
specious.",675
"Feser: “Schmid considers a second possible account of EIT, according to which
existential inertia is simply a basic or primitive feature of reality. He
suggests that one way of reading this claim, in turn, is that it is a
_necessary_ feature of reality that things have existential inertia. But there
are two obvious problems with this. The first is that there is no reason to
believe it. (I’ll come back to that.)”",415
"But there are many obvious problems with Feser’s response here. First, the
purpose of spelling out the metaphysical accounts of EIT is _not_ to provide
positive reasons for accepting them. Rather, the purpose is to _flesh out_ the
inertial thesis, to pinpoint that _in virtue of which_ it is true _if it is
true at all_.",320
"Second, in the present dialectical context, I do _not_ need to give _positive
reasons_ to believe this account of EIT. Once again — and this is a point I
made repeatedly in Section 3 of my [lengthier blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/) — in the present dialectical context of Feser’s
Aristotelian proof, the onus is **not** on _detractors_ to **positively
justify** this account of EIT. They need only point out that (i) nothing in
premise (7) or that which Feser says on its behalf adequately justify
**denying** the account, and that (ii) justifying such a denial is precisely
what would **need** to be done for the proof to work. In other words, the
account need only be proffered as an **undercutting** defeater, and one need
only point out that nothing that Feser says in his chapter gives those who
**do** accept the account sufficient reason to abandon their position.",944
"Third, it’s false that ‘there is no reason to believe it’. You may not _agree_
with the following line of reasoning, but it’s obvious that it at least
represents a reason to believe this account of EIT: Suppose we have reason to
think presentism is true. Suppose we have reason to think that if presentism
is true, then the facts or truths [about temporal realities, like ‘dinosaurs
exist’] change. Suppose we have reason to think that if the facts or truths
themselves change, then any omniscient being’s knowledge likewise changes
[since knowledge is factive, and hence if the facts or truths _themselves_
change, the knowledge couldn’t remain _unchanged_ ]. Suppose we think that if
a being’s knowledge changes, it’s not timeless. Then we have reason to think
that any omniscient being isn’t timeless. Suppose, then, that we have reason
to think that if there is a timeless sustaining cause of temporal things, then
this timeless sustaining cause would be an omniscient God. Since we have
reason to think that no omniscient being is timeless, we thereby have reason
to think that there is no timeless sustaining cause of temporal things. We
thereby have reason to think that at least some temporal things [debarring
infinitely descending chains of per se causal dependence] persist in the
absence of sustenance from without. We thereby have reason to think (a version
of) EIT is true. And as I argued in the stage-setting portion of my IJPR
paper, EET or EIT would be necessarily true if true at all. So we have reason
to think EIT is necessarily true. This alone could justifiably raise one’s
credence in the present account of EIT and thereby constitute some reason to
accept it.",1684
"To be sure, I’m not here claiming that the above argument succeeds in
demonstrating EIT or the second IJPR account under consideration. I’m simply
pointing out that it’s just false — _pace_ Feser — to say that ‘there is no
reason’ to accept the account in question. Even if you don’t think the reason
is adequate, or don’t think some step in the line of argument works, to say
there is _no reason here at all_ just strikes me as obviously wrong.",445
"For these three reasons, Feser’s first “obvious” problem for the second IJPR
account ‘obviously’ fails.",103
"Before turning to what Feser says next, I once more want to flag that the
second IJPR account is another element of the IJPR paper I would slightly
modify if I could. In particular, I think it needs some clarification about
what, precisely — if anything — is doing the explanatory heavy-lifting here.",300
"In subsequent work, I’ve come to call this account a ‘propositional necessity
account’ of EIT, and I wish to add greater clarity to the account from the
IJPR paper. Henceforth, I’ll call this the propositional necessity
understanding of the second IJPR account. To be sure, not everything I’m about
to say is found in the IJPR article. That’s why I said that this is an aspect
of the IJPR paper I would _modify_. Of course, Feser is not responsible (and
nor will I take him to be, as we proceed in this post) for ignoring these
clarifications. But given that such clarifications represent my current,
actual views on the IJPR paper, I will proceed in my analysis of what Feser
says with the clarification in mind.",713
"_Propositional necessity accounts_ explain the truth of EIT in terms of its
_necessary_ truth. Such accounts therefore adduce the necessary truth of the
_proposition_ reporting EIT as an explanation of the proposition’s truth. Why
does O (for each O within EIT’s quantificational domain) persist, according to
such accounts? Simply because (i) _it is a metaphysically necessary truth_
that, if O exists, O persists unless and until positively destroyed, and (ii)
O has not (yet) been subjected to sufficiently destructive factors.",530
"According to this propositional necessity understanding of the second IJPR
account, inertial persistence is “a basic, primitive, foundational feature of
reality”, by which the paper means that it neither analyzes into nor
“obtain[s] in virtue of more fundamental/basic facts” (2021, p. 209). By
‘necessary feature of reality’, it is clear from context that the IJPR paper
means that _EIT itself_ —that is, the existential inertia _thesis_ —is simply
a metaphysically necessary truth.[1] The _truth_ of EIT, then, is explained by
the _metaphysical necessity_ thereof; and its metaphysical necessity is not
explained in terms of any more basic or fundamental truths.",664
"Does this account accrue a theoretical cost by ending in a primitive or
unexplained necessity? It’s not clear that it does. The proposition for which
we seek an explanation is that temporal concrete objects persist. Let this
proposition be _p_. Now, the chain of explanations of _p_ is either finite or
infinite. If it’s infinite, then it’s unclear that we actually have an
adequate explanation of _p_ , after all. If _p_ obtains in virtue of _q 1_,
and _q 1_ obtains in virtue of _q 2_, and so on _ad infinitum_ , arguably we
have simply infinitely _deferred_ an adequate explanation of _p_. This kind of
infinite dependence regress, in many philosophers’ eyes, is vicious. So
suppose that the chain of explanations of _p_ is finite. In that case, the
chain ends in something that is _not further explained_ —that is, it ends in
something primitive.[2] In that case, though, it is surely no mark against the
propositional necessity understanding of the second IJPR account that _it_ ,
too, ends in something primitive, since _every_ explanation of _p_ —if the
aforementioned reasoning holds—must likewise end in something primitive.[3]",1136
"But perhaps someone will object that this propositional necessity account
stops the explanatory buck too early. For there are _further explanations
available_ —ones that are viable and illuminating. All else being equal, if we
have a viable, readily-available, illuminating explanation for _x_ , then we
shouldn’t adopt a view on which _x_ is simply brute. We should, instead,
explain things as far as we can. Schmid’s propositional necessity account
violates this. It explains persistence ultimately by appeal to metaphysical
necessity, which in turn is taken to be a brute or primitive necessity. But
there is a viable, readily-available, illuminating explanation of persistence
in terms of the sustaining activity of something timeless. Yes, this
explanation will eventually bottom out in some primitive metaphysical
necessity; but _unlike_ Schmid’s account, it doesn’t fall afoul of stopping
the explanatory buck too early.",927
"I have two responses. First, even if the alternative account adducing timeless
sustenance has an explanatory advantage over the propositional necessity
account, the latter is far more _parsimonious_ than the former in terms of
both quantitative simplicity (the number of entities postulated) and
qualitative simplicity (the number of irreducible _kinds_ of entities
postulated). For the former posits not only more _entities_ (namely, timeless
concreta in addition to temporal concreta, as well as relations obtaining
between the two) but also more _kinds_ of entities (namely, the new category
of _timeless concreta_ ). Thus, even _granting_ an explanatory advantage to
the timeless sustenance view, it’s not at all clear that it is superior to the
propositional necessity account _all things considered_.",806
"Second, it’s not at all clear that the timeless sustenance view enjoys an
explanatory advantage. For it only seems to _multiply_ rather than _reduce_
mystery. What, for instance, does the timeless-to-temporal explanatory
relation consist in? How can something timeless cause (or ground, or realize,
or whatever) temporal things? If a dynamic view of time is correct, wouldn’t
the timeless cause change at least in its relational properties, thereby
entailing _succession_ in its life (and, hence, temporality)?[4] Moreover, why
does the timeless cause seem to make a concerted effort to ensure that objects
only cease to exist once they are positively destroyed? This harkens back to
an observation made in Oderberg (2014): we witness things ceasing to exist
_when and only when_ they are subjected to destructive forces. But this seems
wholly mysterious if there is an altogether separate way for such objects to
cease to exist (namely, a withdrawal of timeless sustaining activity). If the
timeless sustainer genuinely _could_ remove its sustaining activity at any
moment of an object’s life, it becomes a mystery why this _never_ seems to
occur for objects ( _except_ when and only when the objects are subject to
destructive forces—but even in these cases, it is surely the _destructive
factors_ , not the withdrawal of timeless sustenance, that explain the
object’s cessation).[5] (I note that this problem is compounded even further
for **classical** theism, since absolutely nothing about God himself varies
across worlds in which he timelessly sustains O from t* to t (t* < t) versus
worlds in which God withdraws his timeless sustenance at any point between t*
and t — in which case, we cannot point to any fact about God that varies or
differs across such worlds to account for why, in one world, O persists from
t* to t as opposed to being annihilated at some point therebetween. (Is
‘therebetween’ a word? IT IS NOW!!!!) And I add, moreover, that there are
many, many more worlds of the latter kind than the former, given how many
moments there are in the typical object’s life.]",2091
"Obviously, none of the aforementioned questions amount to _objections_. My
purpose in posing them is to illustrate that the timeless sustenance account
seems merely to _raise_ more questions than it answers. It only seems to
_multiply_ rather than _reduce_ mystery when it comes to explaining
persistence. _This_ is why I say it’s not at all clear that the timeless
sustenance account enjoys an explanatory advantage over my propositional
necessity account.",457
"[1] The paper describes the account, for instance, as one according to which
EIT is “a primitive necessity” (2021, p. 210). The account is thus clearly a
_propositional_ necessity account.",188
"[2] One might think that the terminus of the chain of explanations—while not
explained by any _further_ proposition—is nevertheless _self-explanatory_. I
have two responses. First, I find it plausible that nothing can explain or
account for why it _itself_ is true (or obtains, or exists) at all. For in
order to have any explanatory power in the first place, it would ‘already’ (as
it were) have to be true (obtain, exist). (‘Already’ expresses not temporal
but ontological priority.) Plausibly, one cannot merely _presuppose_ the very
thing for which one sought illumination. (Also, just imagine: if we ask why
_q_ is true, it’s no use responding ‘because _q_ is true’. Surely, I say, this
explains nothing!) But suppose I’m wrong about the impossibility of self-
explanation. Suppose, in other words, that some propositions can explain their
own truth. Presumably, this will involve the proposition having a kind of
‘intrinsic intelligibility’—once the proposition is grasped, there is no
mystery concerning why it is true. This brings us to my second response:
plausibly, _no_ explanation of persistence will be self-explanatory—in which
case, each explanation of persistence will end in an unexplained primitive.
And in that case, the fact that my propositional necessity account ends in an
unexplained primitive is not a mark against it as an explanation of
persistence. Consider explanations of persistence that deny EIT. Such
explanations either adduce one or more _atemporal_ concrete objects that
sustain temporal objects or else an infinitely descending chain of more
fundamental temporal concrete objects sustaining or conserving less
fundamental temporal concrete objects (of which the former aren’t parts). But
surely neither the proposition <there is such an atemporal concrete object>
nor <there is such an infinitely descending chain> are self-explanatory.",1873
"[3] We could go further: this primitive is either contingent or necessary. But
contingent propositions—precisely because they _genuinely could have been
false_ —seem to call out for further explanations of why they are true. (Cf.
Pruss (2006) for an extended defense of the thesis that every contingent
proposition has an explanation.) Plausibly, then, the primitive must be
_necessary_. But then _any_ explanation of _p_ terminates in a primitive
necessity, and so surely it’s no mark against my propositional necessity
account that its explanation of _p_ terminates in a primitive necessity.",593
"[4] For example, assuming that _x_ is causally sustained by the timeless
cause, the timeless cause will arguably _acquire_ a relational (causal)
property once _x_ begins to exist and lose a relational (causal) property once
_x_ ceases to exist. To be sure, such changes need not be _intrinsic_ to the
timeless thing. There are plenty of cases where a subject gains or loses some
_relational_ property without undergoing _intrinsic_ change. (A father might
become shorter than his son solely because _his son has grown_.) But even in
such cases, the subject of the extrinsically relational change is _temporal_ ,
since it can only gain or lose the relational property if there are distinct
moments _m_ and _m*_ of its life at which the relational property is had and
then lacked (or vice versa). Much, much more can be said here on both sides of
the issue, but this suffices for a footnote.",889
"[5] One might say that the timeless sustainer is _necessitated_ to engage in
such sustaining activity. But why would that be? Is this just a brute or
primitive necessity? Going this route will similarly multiply mysteries, it
seems. (Detractors of EIT of a _theist_ stripe will likely resist this
response, too, as it seems to remove the timeless God’s _freedom_.)",364
"Feser: “The second is that there is positive reason to _dis_ believe it.
Again, with lions, Tyrannosauruses, water, etc., there is simply nothing about
their natures or essences that entails that they exist _at all_. So how could
it be just a _basic and necessary_ feature of a world comprised of such things
that they _persist_ in existence?”",343
"There isn’t much I can evaluate here, since Feser just asks a question and, in
doing so, perhaps supposes that his audience shares his intuition that the
following conditional claim is true:",190
"CONDITIONAL: If O’s _existing at all_ is not a basic and necessary fact, then
O’s _persisting (once in existence)_ is not a basic and necessary fact.",149
"I don’t find CONDITIONAL _implausible_ , but I also don’t quite find it
_plausible_. Someone who accepts the propositional necessity account will
presumably just say: ‘CONDITIONAL amounts to a mere denial of my view. Why,
then, should I _accept_ it?’.",251
"Feser next says: “Schmid also suggests that the thesis that it is a necessary
feature of reality that lions, water, etc. have existential inertia is no less
plausible a terminus of explanation than the thesis that God, qua pure
actuality, exists of necessity. Both theses, he claims, posit something
“primitive,” but EIT is more parsimonious.”",343
"I do suggest this in the paper, but I would modify the second IJPR account to
include the clarifications above about what, precisely, is doing the
explanatory heavy-lifting and how, precisely, the account compares with a
rival timeless sustenance account. Next Feser says:",272
"“But this is quite absurd. As I argue in _Five Proofs_ and in my article on
existential inertia (both of which Schmid purports to be responding to in the
present article), the _reason_ contingent things are contingent is that they
are composed of parts, and in particular that they have potentialities as well
as actualities.”",326
"But it is quite absurd to say that the reason contingent things are contingent
is that they are composed of parts, and in particular that they have
potentialities and actualities. Consider the number two. The number two has
various properties, such as the property of being even. But anything with
various properties is a composite thing, by the lights of those who accept a
broadly classical theistic understanding of parthood. (This is one reason they
deny that God has a multiplicity of properties — that would, by their lights,
entail that God has parts, whereas God is simple.) So the number two is a
composite thing. But the number two is not a contingent thing. It’s not like
the number two just happens to exist in some worlds and not others. So surely
the reason why something is contingent is **not** that it is composed of
parts. Or consider a view of God on which God is timeless, immutable,
impassible, necessarily existent, but nevertheless has some potential for
cross-world variance [say, God has potential to have timelessly performed an
act of creation that is numerically distinct from his actual act of creation,
or God has potential to have different intrinsic knowledge states (timelessly)
across worlds, or whatever). It is obvious that nothing about God (so
construed) having some potential for cross-world variance compromises God’s
being metaphysically necessarily existent. And so surely the reason why
something is contingent is **not** that it has potentialities as well as
actualities.",1515
"Again, whether or not you think the number two exists, or whether or not you
accept this model of God, that’s irrelevant, since we are concerned with _in
principle counter-examples_ to the claim that the reason something is
contingent is because it is composite, or that it has potentialities as well
as actualities.",316
"I don’t think, then, that we should be sanguine about what Feser says in the
quoted passage.",92
"Feser: “So, when we say that God is absolutely simple rather than composite
and that he is pure actuality devoid of potentiality, we have given an
_explanation_ of his lacking contingency – that is, of his existing of
necessity.”",229
"But that isn’t the point I was getting at. The point I was getting at is that
even if you have an explanation of the necessity, we can equally well ask, of
your explanation, _why is_ ** _that_** _the case_? What explains God’s being
purely actual and non-composite? [Side note to some: I am not here asking
about what _justifies believing_ that God is purely actual or simple. I’m
asking about what _explains_ why this is so.] And as I argued above in
connection with the propositional necessity understanding of the second IJPR
account, it will ultimately be a primitive or basic fact — a necessary one, to
be sure — that there is this simple, purely actual thing. One cannot appeal to
its simplicity or its pure actuality to explain its simplicity or pure
actuality, for that is circular. And one cannot appeal to its necessity to
explain its simplicity or its pure actuality, since Feser appealed to its
simplicity and/or pure actuality precisely to explain its _necessity_. And so
both accounts end in some primitive fact. Feser might argue that his account
is more illuminating, or that my account stops the explanatory buck too early.
But then I will simply raise the same responses I leveled earlier in comparing
the propositional necessity account to the timeless sustenance account.",1291
"Feser: “By contrast, Schmid’s proposal is that the world is made up of things
that are contingent, composite, and have potentialities as well as actualities
– and yet for all that it is still somehow just a necessary fact about the
world that these things have existential inertia!”",282
"Feser isn’t to blame for this, but — importantly — nothing Feser says here
does anything to target the earlier comparison of the timeless sustenance
account with the propositional necessity understanding of the second IJPR
account. I argued therein that not only is the latter **far** simpler [and,
hence, even if I granted that Feser has an explanatory advantage over this
specific account, it’s an open question whether this sufficiently outweighs
the cost in complexity], but also that the timeless sustenance account raises
more questions than it answers and more mysteries than it resolves, and hence
it is far from obvious whether it is explanatorily superior to the
propositional necessity account in the first place.",724
"Feser: “This is not a case of being presented with a choice between two
alternative possible ultimate explanations, the Thomist’s and Schmid’s.
Rather, it is a case of being presented with a choice between an explanation
and an unexplained and indeed counterintuitive brute fact.”",280
"I have already addressed the reasons Feser proffered on behalf of his
conclusion here, and so I have nothing to add except for the fact that Feser
has not at all successfully done away with the propositional necessity
understanding of the second IJPR account.",259

_needs_ to do this or _should_ do this if he wants to respond to me further.
They’re included for those who want to dig deeper into inertialist-friendly
explanations of persistence.]",411
"This post is Part 6, which deals with everything Feser says in his section
‘Theoretical vices’.",95
"Feser writes: “This naturally brings us to Schmid’s claim that EIT enjoys
several “theoretical virtues” (i.e. virtues of a kind that a good theory ought
to possess). He starts his discussion in this section of the paper by
suggesting that the reason things exist at all may be that it is
_metaphysically necessary_ that something or other exists. And in the same
way, he suggests, the reason things persist in existence may be that it is
simply metaphysically necessary that they do so. EIT thus provides an
explanation of a familiar fact of our experience, viz. that things persist.",583
"To see what is wrong with this, consider the following dialogue:",64
"_Fred: Hmm, maybe it was metaphysically necessary that he do so?_",65
"_Bob: Wow, that’s an interesting explanation! And why do you think he_ kept
_drinking it once he started?_",106
_Fred: I’ve got it – maybe_ that _was metaphysically necessary too!_,68
"I take it you agree with me that Fred’s explanation is not in fact that
brilliant. For why on earth would anyone think it even prima facie plausible
that it is _necessary_ that I start to drink a martini? True, my nightly
routine might for a moment make you wonder, but after a moment’s reflection
you’d realize that there are many factors that would prevent it from being
necessary – I could run out of gin, or the kids could hide the bottles, or I
could opt for a Scotch instead, or whatever. And if it is not prima facie
plausibly necessary that I _start_ drinking, it is hardly any more prima facie
plausible that I will of necessity _keep_ doing so.”",655
"But that is not what I suggest. Let’s read what I say in the paper on this
point:",81
"I am quite clear here that I am seeking to explain a **contrastive** fact:
“why do objects, once in existence, persist in existence **_instead of_**
being instantly annihilated or annihilated at random, arbitrary points during
their existence?”, and “objects persist **_rather than_** succumb to instant
or random annihilation because…”, and “explains why objects persist **_rather
than_** chaotically being annihilated” (emphasis added in each).",446
"But Feser has here characterized me as explaining persistence _simpliciter_.
But that is to subtly under-describe what I’m doing. I am **not** seeking to
explain, in the passage, _mere_ persistence _simpliciter_. I’m contrasting two
situations: one in which things uniformly and reliably persist absent
sufficiently destructive causal factors, and one in which things annihilate at
seemingly chaotic or random points in their lives without some sufficiently
destructive causal factor operative. And I go on to try and show how EIT
nicely explains why we see the former _rather than_ (as opposed to, instead
of) the latter.",622
"And I take EIT to have a clearly satisfactory explanation of this contrastive
fact. Consider that in debates surrounding the PSR and various causal
principles [like those adduced in cosmological-type arguments, such as the
Kalam], defenders of such principles will say something like ‘why is it that
we see a uniform, regular, intelligible reality rather than things just
chaotically popping into and out of existence uncausedly and inexplicably? Why
isn’t there chaos instead? Why doesn’t Beethoven, or a raging tiger, or whole
swathes of photons just spring into existence without an explanation or cause?
Here’s a nice explanation: these don’t happen because such unexplained,
uncaused occurrences are simply _metaphysically impossible_. And this is just
to say that the (necessary truth of the) PSR or the causal principle
(variously construed) provides a satisfying explanation of the data.’",896
"I find this to be a perfectly kosher explanation. And yet the explanation is
structurally identical to mine [essentially replacing ‘EIT’ with ‘PSR/causal
principle’ and ‘chaotically ceasing to exist’ with ‘chaotically ceasing _and_
beginning to exist’], and so I take mine, too, to be a perfectly kosher
explanation.",316
"Indeed, things get even more interesting when we do a Bayesian comparison
between EIT and a classical theistic timeless sustenance (CTTS) account of
persistence when it comes to explaining the contrastive fact above. Let that
fact be F. Now, recall F: temporal objects, once in existence, uniformly and
reliably persist absent sufficiently destructive causal factors as opposed to
being annihilated at other points in their lives without being subject to
causal destruction. For under EIT as I articulate it in the IJPR paper, the
probability of F is 1. In other words, P(F|EIT) = 1. But the probability of F
is, I would argue, significantly less than 1 under CTTS. In other words,
P(F|CTTS)<<1\. And this is all to say that F strongly confirms EIT vis-a-vis
CTTS.",764
"Why do I say P(F|CTTS)<<1? Consider that for an object to persist for about
116 days is for it to persist approximately 10000000 seconds. And consider
that there are about 1044 Planck times in one second, and hence to persist for
about 116 days is to persist for about 1051 Planck times. Now, for each
(potential) Plank time in an object’s life, God is free to sustain the object
for that Planck time or refrain from so sustaining it, and this is true even
if God has sustained the object through previous Planck times. [It’s not as
though God suddenly becomes forced or compelled to continue sustaining an
object, or as though some moral obligation is newly imposed on him, or
whatever.] This entails that for a given world w in which an object persists
for (at least) 116 days and is then causally destroyed by something, there are
about 1051 worlds in which that object ceases to exist at some point earlier
than w due to God’s withdrawal of sustenance. Moreover, under classical
theism, God remains utterly invariant across all worlds, and hence there is no
difference or variance on God’s end to which one could point in _any_ such
world to explain why **it** came about as opposed to some **other** world.
Thus, conditional on CTTS, the expectation that the single world in which the
object persists up to 116 days (when it is finally causally destroyed) obtains
rather than any of the other 1051 worlds is very small. And hence the data of
F, as applied to this 116-day-lived object, is very unlikely conditional on
CTTS, where its probability is 1 conditional on EIT. And hence EIT garners
very strong evidential confirmation from F vis-a-vis CTTS. Much more can be
said on this line of reasoning, but that suffices for a brief sketch (and,
hence, it suffices for the purposes of this blog post).",1804
"Long story short, then, it seems to me that EIT not only provides an
illuminating explanation of F [just as the PSR/causal principle does with
respect to the absence of chaotic beginnings and cessations] but also gains
substantial evidential confirmation from F vis-a-vis CTTS. And so Feser’s
protestations to the contrary — that is, his protestations that my explanation
is not, after all, illuminating (or at least not _adequately_ illuminating) —
are mistaken.",463
"Continuing back with Feser: “But the existence and persistence of everyday
objects (lions, water, etc.) are in the same boat. Again, there is nothing in
the essence of any of these things that entails that they exist; they are
composed of parts, and thus depend for their existence on these parts being
combined; they have potentialities which need to be actualized in order for
them to exist; and so on.”",405
"I doubt something’s being composite entails that it depends [metaphysically]
on its parts, given whole-to-part grounding and whatnot, but I won’t pursue
that here. [For those curious, you can read [my
chapter](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5nb6ib8yj3xue3w/Neo-
Platonic%20Proof%2C%20CH%208%20%5BSchmid%5D.docx?dl=0) from my book on the
Neo-Platonic proof. [A significant portion of this is also a minor R&R at a
journal. So this is for personal use only, please. 🙂 ]",462
"What I will say, though, is that I have already addressed Feser’s argument
aiming to bridge the gap from ‘nothing about the essence of these things
entails that they exist’ to ‘nothing about the essence of these things entails
that they persist’ to ‘they don’t inertially persist, i.e., they need
continuous sustenance from without in order to persist’. I addressed this (or
a well-nigh identical) argument at length in [Part
4](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-part-4/).",527
"Feser: “That is why they are contingent. So, if there is nothing more to
reality than things of that sort, how could it be _metaphysically necessary_
that there be things of that sort? And if it is not prima facie plausibly
metaphysically necessary that things of this sort exist at all, how could it
be any more prima facie plausibly metaphysically necessary that they must
_persist_ in existence?",398
"Of course, that doesn’t entail that there is _nothing_ of which it could be
said that it is metaphysically necessary that it exists and persists in
existence. Certainly, this could plausibly be said of something that is
absolutely simple and devoid of potentiality (precisely since to be something
of that sort is to lack the features that make a thing contingent). But of
course, that’s precisely the sort of thing Schmid wants to avoid positing.”",448
"But, first, I have already explained why ‘this is why they are contingent’ is
false. See [Part 5](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/09/feser-on-
schmid-on-existential-inertia-vicious-circularity-and-the-metaphysics-of-eit-
part-5/) [and, in particular, search “Consider the number two”]. Second, I
have already addressed in [Part
4](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-part-4/) and [Part
5](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/09/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-vicious-circularity-and-the-metaphysics-of-eit-part-5/)
Feser’s conditional argument from ‘not metaphysically necessary that they
exist’ to ‘not metaphysically necessary that, once in existence, they
persist’.",754
"Feser: “So, Schmid’s proposed “explanation” is really no more interesting than
Fred’s. If we ask “Why does God have existential inertia?” the theist can
offer a response: “Because he is non-composite and devoid of potentiality, and
thus lacks the features that entail contingency or possible non-existence.”
But if we ask “Why do ordinary contingent things like lions, water, etc. have
existential inertia?” all Schmid can say in response is: “I don’t know, but
maybe it’s just a necessary fact about them that they have it – wouldn’t that
give us a cool explanation of why they persist?” (Talk about your proverbial
“dormitive virtue” explanation!)",649
"Now suppose someone said: “Hey, let’s not be _too_ quick to dismiss Fred’s
explanation. Consider its theoretical virtues, such as parsimony…” Would you
stick around to listen? Probably not. There’s no point in considering such
theoretical virtues if the “explanation” is already independently known to be
a non-starter. That’s true of Fred’s explanation, and (for all he has shown)
it is, for the reasons I’ve given, true of Schmid’s as well.”",443
"But I have already explained why this is **not** true of the propositional
necessity understanding of the second IJPR account, and I have already
explained why the explanation is, indeed, illuminating. What’s more, the
propositional necessity understanding of the second IJPR account is
significantly evidentially confirmed by the data [namely, F]. So I won’t
pursue all that again. I will note, though, that Feser hasn’t, so far, raised
an objection to my paper that hasn’t been met.",484
"Feser: “There are other problems with Schmid’s discussion in this section of
his paper. For instance, commenting on my example in _Five Proofs_ of the
existence of the water in a cup of coffee being explained in terms of the
existence of its parts, he notes that it could plausibly be said instead that
the parts in fact depend for their existence of the whole. Indeed, as he
notes, that is what I myself have said elsewhere. He insinuates that there is,
accordingly, an incoherence in my position.",498
"But there is no such incoherence, and Schmid ignores what should be clear from
the context of that discussion in _Five Proofs_ , viz. that I am speaking
there in a “for the sake of argument” way. As I said in the book and in my
previous post on Schmid, there are several possible ways one could spell out
the metaphysics of the water as it exists at a time _t_ : (a) in terms of
substantial form and prime matter, after the fashion of Aristotelian
hylemorphism, (b) in terms of essence and existence, as a Thomist would, (c)
as an aggregate of particles, as a reductive naturalist might, or (d) in yet
some other way. It doesn’t matter for the specific purposes of the argument,
and for the sake of ease of exposition and the naturalistic scruples of many
readers, I went with (c) even though my own predilection is for (a) and (b).",832
"Schmid’s discussion ignores this, and makes it sound like I am contradicting
myself. Once again, the untutored reader who has read his article (but not
_Five Proofs_ ) might think he’s raised some devastating criticism, when in
fact he has simply failed to read what I wrote carefully.”",286
There are many things I will say in response to this.,53
"First, I do think greater clarity is called for in my IJPR paper at this
point, greater clarity that I implemented in my Sophia paper but did not
implement in my IJPR paper. In my IJPR paper, I said Feser treats the coffee’s
molecules (and atoms and the bonds between them and whatnot) as sustaining
causes. In the interim between writing my IJPR paper and Sophia paper, though,
I came to think that there may be some alternative interpretations of Feser’s
examples. And so in my Sophia article I made the more precise and cautious
claim _not_ that _Feser_ treats them this way but rather that **one** might
treat them in that way. Thus, if I could re-write the IJPR paper, I would
follow what I said in the Sophia article. So there is some sense in which I
agree with Feser that the IJPR article should be clarified that the
specification of parts in the relevant passage is not necessarily one Feser
would _adhere_ to.",920
"But — and this is my second point — it is _not at all clear_ from context — at
least to me — that Feser is merely proffering this in a ‘for the sake of
argument’ way. [To use Feser’s expression, it is _murky_ , from context,
whether Feser is proffering this in that manner.] For one thing, he has
probably already lost all or nearly all reductive naturalists in the first few
pages of his chapter concerning his Aristotelian analysis of change as the
transition or reduction from potential being to actual being. This makes it a
bit odd — by my lights — that he is concerned to make his examples later in
the chapter kosher by the lights of reductive naturalists. This would be like
Alex Rosenburg running an argument against Feser’s classical theism by
beginning with an atomist account of change as the rearrangement of particles
in the void and then later characterizing some of his examples or points in
hylemorphist terms ‘for the sake of argument’ so that such examples or points
would be kosher to A-T classical theists. For another thing, there is simply
no indication, in and around the paragraph where the ‘actualizers’ are being
characterized as constituent parts like molecules, that this is done in a ‘for
the sake of argument’ way. Consider the following pages:",1275
"This is all stated matter-of-factly, not conditionally like ‘the water’s
potential to exist here and now is actualized (in part) by the atoms and their
being bonded in such-and-such a way — at least according to the reductive
naturalist understanding of the situation.’ At the very least, I am hardly to
blame for what seems for all the world _not_ to be a conditional, ‘for the
sake of argument’ exposition.",408
"It seems to me that the only thing that comes close to legitimizing Feser’s
claim that it is ‘clear from context’ that he is characterizing the situation
in a ‘for the sake of argument’ way is the following footnote:",216
"But notice something crucial in this footnote: **nowhere** does Feser renounce
the claim that the atoms and molecules and their bonds actualize (at least in
part) the water’s potential to exist. Rather, Feser only says that this way of
speaking might tempt someone into thinking that the water is **nothing but**
the atoms and molecules and their specific arrangement. And then Feser goes on
to explain that he (and Aristotelian hylemorphists) would reject such a
reductive view according to which the water is nothing but the aggregate of
suitably-arranged atoms. But all of this is perfectly compatible with Feser
still holding that it is correct to characterize the situation as one in which
the atoms and molecules and bonds actualize (in part) the water’s potential to
exist. This is because such a characterization does **not** imply that the
water is _nothing but_ an aggregate of such suitably-arranged atoms.",917
"What’s more, Feser explicitly says that the Aristotelian hylemorphist
understanding is not necessary to the argument — in which case, he takes it
that the argument can succeed with the non-hylemorphist specification of the
situation in the main text. But in that case, it is perfectly kosher for me to
point out, as I did in my IJPR article, that Feser has merely pinpointed
_constituents_ as opposed to _sustaining actualizers of existence_.",442
"Here is my third and final point: my overarching point in the IJPR paper
stands _regardless_ of whether Feser characterizes the situation in ‘reductive
naturalist’ or Aristotelian hylemorphist terms. Even if Feser characterized
the situation in hylemorphist terms, the form and matter are **not** extrinsic
sustaining causes, and hence my overarching point at this stage in the paper —
that “we lack any good experiential reason to affirm the existence of
sustaining causes of existence—precisely what we would expect if EIT were
true” — remains true.",551
"Overall, I think it’s **false** that I have failed to read Feser carefully.
Upon painstaking analysis, nothing in Feser (2017, ch. 1) gives me a sense of
‘oh, yeah, this is a for-the-sake-of-argument way of expositing the situation
— I don’t actually accept this characterization’. Indeed, I get the opposite
sense.",315
"Feser: “Schmid suggests that another virtue of EIT over the thesis that God
sustains things in being is that it better accounts for how physical objects
maintain their identity over time. Indeed, he says that “it is unclear that
[the latter thesis] can even account for diachronic identity in the first
place,” and he goes on to devote two and half pages to developing this theme.",380
"But who on earth ever suggested in the first place that the thesis that God
sustains things in being explains the identity of things over time? Not me,
and not anyone else as far as I know. That’s simply not a question that the
thesis is trying to address. You might as well object “But the thesis that God
sustains things in being doesn’t account for Feser’s martini habit!” Who said
it did?”",393
"But my paper’s point was **not** that the thesis that God sustains things in
being is (or was ever proposed as) an explanation of diachronic identity. It
is clear from the paper that what I **was** arguing is that **once** one
accepts an explanation of **persistence** by appeal to Feser’s-Aristotelian-
proof-understanding-of theistic sustenance, one thereby threatens diachronic
identity. (And **this** is what I mean when I say the theistic sustenance view
at hand ‘doesn’t account for’ or ‘doesn’t account well for’ diachronic
identity.) I then point out that one way for the Aristotelian-proof-proponent
to _avoid_ this problem is to accept transtemporal explanatory relations
[e.g., causal relations] among the successive phases of an object’s life, but
that this furnishes the _opponent_ of the Aristotelian proof with an
undercutting defeater thereof: once we accept such transtemporal (say) causal
relations, why postulate any **additional** explanatory work done by a
sustaining cause? Why not hold — as per the transtemporal understanding of the
first IJPR account [cf. [Part
5](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/09/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-vicious-circularity-and-the-metaphysics-of-eit-part-5/)] —
that such transtemporal causal relations alone suffice? [Remember, the
detractor of the Aristotelian proof need not _positively justify_ the thesis
that such relations alone suffice; they need only point out that what is said
on behalf of premise (7) does not give those who **do** think such relations
alone suffice adequate reason to abandon their position.]",1598
"Feser: “So, why would Schmid think to raise this issue? The reason is apparent
from this passage:",97
"_On Feser’s account, God does not act_ on _a previously existent concrete
object to conserve it in existence, preserving its original constituents.
Instead, God_ wholly reconstitutes _concrete objects from utter non-being at
each and every moment_.",248
"This makes it sound like my view is that things are annihilated and recreated
at every moment. But I have never said such a thing, and it is not my view.
Conserving things in being is not the same thing as recreating them after they
have been annihilated. Indeed, the whole point is that God keeps them from
being annihilated. And Aristotelian-Thomistic metaphysicians don’t explain
diachronic identity in terms of divine conservation, but rather in terms of
factors _intrinsic_ to substances, such as substantial form and designated
matter. (Cf. my discussion of that issue in [_Scholastic
Metaphysics_](https://www.amazon.com/Scholastic-Metaphysics-A-Contemporary-

etc.)”",1013
"I agree with Feser that greater clarity is needed in the quoted passage. In
particular, the passage needs to clarify what it is about Feser’s model that
poses the problem. Adding the following clarification to the passage is
something I _would_ modify about the IJPR paper if I could. Here is the
clarification.",311
"This clarification — one which, again, I fully admit **should** have been
included in the IJPR paper — derives precisely from the same disambiguation of
the Aristotelian proof’s causal principle we saw in the sub-section ‘ _A
Tension?_ ’ of Section 3 of [my lengthier blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/). In particular, it seems to me that the causal principle
may be ambiguous between two different readings:",478
"**_First reading_** : if there are a range of potentials p1, p2, … pn, only
one of which can be actual[ized] (at a given time), and one of them, pi, is
actual[ized] (at a given time), then there is some cause which makes pi actual
(at a given time). [NB: if you don’t like talk of potentials here, substitute
‘possibilities’. Nothing hangs on this.]",349
"**_Second reading_** : whenever there is some transition from potential being
to actual being — i.e., whenever something that exists in potency is brought
from its (ontologically or causally or temporally) prior state of existing in
potency to its state of existing in actuality — there is an already actual
cause of this transition.",333
"Now, my diachronic identity worry for the Aristotelian-proof-understanding-of
theistic sustenance is, I think, predicated on the **second** reading of the
causal principle. For if there is some transition of an entire object from
potential being to actual being at each and every moment of an object’s life,
there does, indeed, seem to be a problematic kind of continual re-constitution
of an object in its entirety. And this, in turn, seems to render this a case
_not_ of diachronic identity but _instead_ a series of numerically distinct
simulacra. The object seems to be brought about anew, in whole, at each moment
of its existence from a (causally or ontologically prior) state of potential
being into a state of actual being. So I take it that my points in the IJPR
paper do, indeed, constitute a serious worry for the Aristotelian-proof-
understanding-of theistic sustenance **assuming** the second reading.",914
"But what about the first reading? Doesn’t that avoid the problematic
‘continual re-bringing-about of the object from total potential being to total
actual being at each moment’ worry that intuitively undermines diachronic
identity? Yes. I think it probably avoids the problem.",276
"But if the first reading avoids the problem posed for diachronic identity,
then why didn’t I consider it in the paper?",118
"I have two responses. My first response is that I have already said that I
**should** have made this disambiguation between the different readings of the
causal principle in the paper. So I admit that this should have been included.
There are, though, underlying reasons why I only went with the second reading.
That is my second response.",339
"To explicate this second response further, consider that it doesn’t seem that
Feser (2017, ch. 1) anywhere justifies a causal principle to the effect of the
first reading. Instead, Feser defends a causal principle on which every change
— that is, every case where there is indeed some prior state of potential that
is caused to go from that state to a state of actuality — is caused by
something already actual. (Feser does take an existential turn in his proof
and applies the principle to the momentary existence of an object. But that is
compatible with the second reading, since the ‘prior’ in the second reading is
consistent with a **causally** or **ontologically** prior state rather than a
temporal one.)",712
"For another thing — and as I’ve explained at the beginning of Section 3 in [my
lengthier blog post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-
on-schmid-on-the-aristotelian-proof/) — the first reading would
straightforwardly debar the inference to a _purely_ actual being. For suppose
that the unactualized actualizer is simply a _necessary_ but non-purely-actual
being, A. In that cause, it is simply _false_ that there are a range of
potentials when it comes to the very _being_ , _existence_ , or _actuality_ of
A, since A is _necessarily actually existent_. It thus has no potential
pertaining to its very substantial being or existence (e.g., potentials to
cease to exist, to begin to exist, or to be absent from reality altogether).
Thus, if the causal principle at play in the Aristotelian proof _were_ the one
previously articulated, then the Aristotelian proof would be incapable of
justifying the need for a sustaining, actualizing cause of A. (Why? Because
the antecedent of the causal principle is simply false when it comes to A’s
very being or existence — there isn’t a range of potentials concerning A’s
very substantial existence. And so one cannot infer, solely _by means of_ said
causal principle, that A has a cause of its existence.) And if the
Aristotelian proof were incapable of justifying the need for a sustaining,
actualizing cause of A, then it simply couldn’t show that the unactualized
actualizer is _purely_ actual, since — for all the argument shows — _A_ could
be the unactualized actualizer, and A is _not purely actual_.",1567
"I would thereby cast my diachronic identity worry not so much as a worry
_simpliciter_ but rather a dilemma _one of whose disjuncts_ is a worry. Under
the first reading, the above two problems arise. But under the second reading,
it seems one cannot preserve diachronic identity.",279
"Perhaps Feser would say that the first and second readings would represent a
false dichotomy. But, first — and this might be due to my lack of imagination
— it’s difficult for me to see any other plausible rendition or reading of
what Feser’s causal principle amounts to.",271
"[Part of what makes things a little difficult — for me, at least — is that
Feser first defends the causal principle as applied to _change_ , i.e., some
transition from a prior state of potential being to a posterior state of
actual being, and then later in his chapter takes an existential turn and
applies the principle [or a similar principle, or maybe a different
principle?] to the very existence of a substance at a given moment. Maybe he
means for his principle to be a conjunctive one, like: in the case of change,
the _first_ reading is the causal principle; but in the case of existence-at-
a-single moment, the _second_ reading [or something very much like it] is the
causal principle. In any case, you can see why, since publishing my IJPR
article, I want to clarify the passage at hand. Alright, end of digression.]",827
"And, second, even if the dichotomy is not properly exhaustive, it’s going to
be difficult to find another alternative that doesn’t succumb to the problems
afflicting each thus-far-demarcated disjunct. If you make the principle too
change-centered [a la the second reading], you’ll make the Aristotelian proof
incompatible with CT on account of entailing a [causally or ontologically or
else temporally] prior state of potential being [prior to creation, that is].
If you make the principle too cross-world-difference-centered, you’ll fall
into the same problems as earlier [to wit, (i) the fact that Feser doesn’t
justify such cross-world-difference-centered principles in (2017, ch. 1), and
(ii) such principles will undermine the proof’s inference to A’s being
**purely** actual as opposed to necessarily-actually-existent-while-having-
potency-for-accidental-change-or-accidental-cross-world-variance.] This is a
very fine-line to walk along, and I’m skeptical it can be done.",979
"“Here too Schmid trots out the standard analytic philosopher’s hoo-hah – semi-
formal exposition, oddball thought experiments, etc. – developed in the
service of a gigantic red herring. The unwary reader thinks he’s being treated
to a really rigorous critique of my arguments, when in fact he’s being led on
a wild goose chase.”",328
"As I hope the reader can see by now, there is no such wild goose chase. To be
sure, there are some places in the IJPR article where greater clarity is
needed, and as Feser is writing the passage above, he had just finished
talking about one section wherein I do, indeed, need greater clarity. And I
100% take the blame for not adding such clarity into the IJPR article to begin
with. But with the clarification in place, I see no goose chase.",442
"Feser next says: “Now, Schmid does consider the possibility that I might reply
by saying that the previous state of an object at _t_ – 1 _together with_
divine action is what accounts for its existence and state at _t_. But he
objects that “it’s unclear that there is any independent motivation for this
move apart from a prior acceptance that things require sustaining causes of
their existence.”",397
"Well, of course that’s the motivation, but there’s nothing wrong with that.
Again, Schmid’s discussion here falsely supposes that divine conservation is
intended to be an explanation _of diachronic identity_. And in that light, one
might think it a good objection to ask why, if factors intrinsic to a
substance explain diachronic identity, we need to bring in divine
conservation.",381
"But again, divine conservation is _not_ in the first place being brought in to
explain diachronic identity. That application is a figment of Schmid’s
imagination. There are two issues here: what accounts for a thing’s _identity_
over time, and what accounts for its _persistence in being_. Divine
conservation is intended to deal with the second issue; again, the first issue
is dealt with instead in terms of factors like substantial form, designated
matter, etc. (True, God conserves those in being too, like he does everything
else. But the point is that divine conservation is not brought in to explain
diachronic identity _per se_.)”",638
"But I have already explained why Feser is mistaken here. My point was **not**
that the thesis that God sustains things in being is (or was ever proposed as)
an explanation of diachronic identity. It is clear from the paper that what I
**was** arguing is that **once** one accepts an explanation of **persistence**
by appeal to Feser’s-Aristotelian-proof-understanding-of theistic sustenance,
one thereby threatens diachronic identity. I then point out that one way for
the Aristotelian-proof-proponent to _avoid_ this problem is to accept
transtemporal explanatory relations [e.g., causal relations] among the
successive phases of an object’s life, but that this furnishes the _opponent_
of the Aristotelian proof with an undercutting defeater thereof.",752
"The point, then, is that Feser is mistaken in saying that I treat [the
Aristotelian-proof’s-conception-of] divine conservation as wielded to explain
diachronic identity. Of course it’s not. My point, instead, is that the
Aristotelian-proof’s-conception-of divine conservation is, of course, wielded
to explain **persistence** ; but that its explanation of persistence **does
collateral damage** — in particular, it threatens diachronic identity, as
explained above in connection with the second reading of the causal principle.",527
"In Part 7, I will address everything Feser says in ‘An argument against EIT’.",77
"This post is Part 7, which deals with everything Feser says in his section ‘An
argument against EIT’.",101
"After spelling out the argument from the Principle of Proportionate Causality
(PPC), Feser proceeds to address my rejoinders thereof.",133
"Before getting to Feser’s rejoinders, I want to spell out what I have come to
see as the biggest problem for the argument. I don’t think I raised this
problem in the IJPR article, but I take it to be the most serious problem for
the argument.",242
"In particular, I think premise (3) is straightforwardly false, and I have
indirectly explained why throughout this series. Premise (3) says: “Something
has existential inertia if and only if it has of itself [i.e., _intrinsically_
or _internally_ [Fn]] a tendency to persist in existence once it exists.”",304
"[Fn] It is clear from context, it seems to me, that this is what Feser means.
Consider, for instance, that Feser seems to infer that ‘no material substance
has a tendency of itself to persist in existence once it exists’ from the
facts that ‘there are no other internal principles from which such a substance
might derive such a tendency’ and ‘form and matter are internal principles
from neither of which the substance can derive a tendency to persist’. This
inference only seems to work if by ‘of itself’ Feser means ‘intrinsically or
internally’.",549
"The left-to-right side of the biconditional here says that an existential
inertial tendency intrinsic to S is a necessary condition for S’s persisting
inertially. But this is essentially equivalent to what we saw Feser claiming
in [Part 3](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/feser-on-schmid-
on-existential-inertia-part-3/). Therein we saw Feser say, “if EIT is false,
then it is not something intrinsic to the water; and if there is no sustaining
cause, then it will not be something extrinsic to it either.”",523
"But we also saw that this was mistaken. It is false that if there is no
sustaining cause at t [or from (t-1) to t, which I shall hereafter drop], then
the explanation for an object’s existence at t will not be something extrinsic
to the object at t. For there are whole swathes of explanations of an object’s
persistence that do not adduce sustaining causes and yet adduce facts
extrinsic to the object itself at t.",415
"Consider, for instance, one of the explanations I proffered in section 3 of my
[lengthier blog post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-
on-schmid-on-the-aristotelian-proof/) and which I’ll adumbrate here:",225
"For S to **fail** to exist at m despite existing from [m*, m), m* < m, is for
some **change** to occur.[Fn] But a change occurs only if some factor causally
induces said change. Hence, if no factor causally induces a change, then the
change won’t occur. Thus, if no factor causally induces S to fail to exist at
m despite existing from [m*, m), then S exists at m. Once we add that nothing
came along to causally induce this — that is, once we addd that nothing came
along to destroy S from m* to m — it simply follows that S exists at m. [Cf.
Section 4.1 in the [lengthier blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/) for more on this line of thought.]",713
"Here, we seem to have a perfectly respectable, perfectly legitimate
explanation of S’s existence at m — and this explanation adduces facts outside
of or extrinsic to S at m. And the explanation does, indeed, tell us how S
exists at m. That was a straightforward deduction of the explanatory facts
cited [namely, (i) S existed immediately before m, (ii) nothing causally
induced S’s cessation at m [i.e., nothing destroyed S from the immediately
prior moment(s) through m], and (iii) a change occurs only if some factor
causally induces said change]. And so we do, indeed, have sufficient
explanation for S’s existence at m, one that doesn’t adduce some extrinsic
sustaining efficient cause. For me at least, the explanation certainly seems
to remove mystery as to why/how S exists at m. The present explanation
**does** , indeed, tell us how S exists at m. [I discuss and defend EIT-
friendly explanations of persistence that adduce facts extrinsic to S at m

engage with this document if he responds. I include it for those who want to
dig deeper.]",1226

And on and on. Feser’s claim is just false.",672
"To drive home the point, consider again Explanans 1, Explanans 2, and
Explanandum from [Part
5](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/09/feser-on-schmid-on-

"In the case of the transtemporal understanding of the first IJPR account, we
have:",82
"**Explanans 1** : (i) there is an absence of sufficiently causally destructive
factors operative on S from (m-1) to m [where (m-1) is the moment immediately
prior to m], and (ii) the state and/or existence of temporal concrete objects
(or, at least, those within EIT’s quantificational domain) at a given moment
(m-1) at which they exist causally produce their existence at the next moment,
m, provided that no sufficiently causally _destructive_ factors are operative.",469
"In the case of the no-change understanding of the first IJPR account, we have:",78
"**Explanans 2** : (i) S existed immediately before m — that is, at (m-1) —
(ii) if S existed immediately before m but fails to exist at m, then S’s
cessation is (or involves, or entails) some kind of change, (iii) nothing
causally induces S’s cessation at (m-1) or m — that is, nothing destroyed S
from the immediately prior moment, (m-1), through m — and (iv) a change occurs
only if some factor causally induces said change.",426
"Now, neither Explanans 1 nor Explanans 2 cite facts that explain the
Explanandum [S’s existence at m] that are intrinsic to that Explanandum [i.e.,
that are intrinsic to S at m or S’s existence at m]. And yet both of these
scenarios are ones in which S inertially persists. And hence something can
inertially persist [i.e., persist without continuously and concurrently
operative sustenance from without] without this inertial persistence being
derived from [or resultant from or explained by or constituted by] some
intrinsic principle [or tendency or what have you]. (Instead, for each non-
first moment m of S’s life, the explanation of S at m is extrinsic to S at m
but not a concurrently operative extrinsic sustaining efficient cause.[Fn])
Hence, premise (3) is false.",774
"[Fn] Alternatively, if one wants to say — at least with respect to the
transtemporal understanding of the first IJPR account — that the explanation
is intrinsic to S _in the sense that_ the ‘principal explanatory mechanism’ —
transtemporal causal relations that relate the successive phases of S’s life —
is entirely contained within S’s life, that’s fine. Then premise (7) [“there
are no other internal principles from which such a substance might derive such
a tendency”] would be false, since there **is** something intrinsic to S’s
life that accounts for S’s inertial persistence — to wit, transtemporal causal
relations among the successive phases or states of S’s life.",675
"Anyway, I take the above objection targeting premise (3) to be the most
powerful. But, alas, I only came to appreciate its force after writing the
IJPR article. Nevertheless, I’ll proceed with the criticism in mind (being
careful, of course, not to fault Feser for not addressing it).",284
"Feser: “Schmid raises four objections against this argument. First, he
suggests that the defender of EIT could simply reject hylemorphism on the
grounds that, if my argument is correct, hylemorphism would conflict with EIT.
Which is true, but not terribly interesting if I have independent arguments
for hylemorphism – [as, of course, I do](https://www.amazon.com/Scholastic-
Metaphysics-A-Contemporary-
Introduction/dp/3868385444/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1391482601&sr=8-1&keywords=scholastic+metaphysics+a+contemporary+introduction).
But it wouldn’t be reasonable to expect Schmid to present a general critique
of those arguments in a journal article devoted to another topic, so for
present purposes we can put this issue to one side.”",736
"I don’t have much to say about this, apart from the fact that it **is**
important to note that the argument is only an argument against EIT
conditional on the truth of hylemoprhism, and that this need not threaten
those inertialists who reject hylemorphism. (And they’ll have responses to
what Feser has written elsewhere regarding hylemoprhism; and, of course, Feser
will have further responses; and they’ll have further responses; and so on.)",444
"Feser: “Second, Schmid notes that the Principle of Proportionate Causality (of
which premise 1 above is one formulation) allows that there are several ways
in which what is in an effect may preexist in its cause. And he suggests that
a tendency to persist in existence may preexist in a material thing’s
metaphysical constituents in a more subtle way than I consider. In particular,
he suggests that even if neither prime matter nor substantial form by
themselves have a tendency to persist in existence, maybe in combination they
will produce something that does have such a tendency – just as two colorless
chemical constituents might be combined in a way that generates something that
is red.”",696
"This is a good exposition of how I articulated the objection in my IJPR
article; however, we should note that at times in my IJPR article, I spoke of
‘a tendency’ in a metaphysically heavyweight manner, and I have explained why
I would modify this in [Part
4](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-part-4/).",358
"Feser: “One problem with this is that, just left at that, it doesn’t really
amount to much of an objection. For in the case of the chemical constituents,
there are chemical facts we can point to that explain exactly _why_ they will
together generate something red. But Schmid does not tell us _exactly what it
is_ about prime matter and substantial form that would (or indeed _could_ ),
when they are combined, generate a tendency to persist in existence.”",456
"This is **not** how the dialectical context works, though. My objection is an
**undercutting** defeater. I don’t need to _positively justify or spell out_
exactly what it is about prime matter and substantial form that would, when
combined, result in such a tendency. I need only point out that nothing Feser
says in his argument gives any reason for **ruling this out** , and that
ruling this out is what he would **need** to do for his argument to succeed.
In other words, I need only point out that Feser has not given the
hylemorphically-inclined existential ienrtialist who **does** think that the
form and matter, when combined, result in such a tendency **sufficient reason
to** ** _abandon_** **their position**. And so it is irrelevant that I don’t
specify exactly what it is about form and matter that, when combined, results
in such a tendency.",855
"Imagine we live in 1000 BC without any knowledge of the underlying chemistry
of chemical species A, B, and C. I have gone blind recently, but you haven’t.
Before going blind, I interacted a lot with A and B and know that they are
colorless liquids. But neither you nor I have combined A and B together to see
what results. Today, though, that’s gonna change. We combine A and B together
to produce C. You can see that C is a vibrant red liquid. I, of course,
cannot. You tell me it’s vibrant red. I scoff, responding with the following:",536
"“But that’s not possible. The only things from which C could derive such a
feature would be A and B, and neither of them have the feature to grant to C.
They are both colorless. And so there is simply nowhere from which C could
derive this vibrant color. You must therefore either be lying to me, or
playing a trick on me, or your visual apparatus is malfunctioning.”",367
"“But your argument there assumes that there is nothing about A and B such
that, **_when combined_** , they are able to manifest this further feature not
found in either of them individually. Think of it like wine. Wine has a flavor
none of its various constituents individually do.”",282
"“That doesn’t really amount to much of an objection! In the case of the wine,
there are facts we can point to that explain exactly _why_ they will together
generate something with a distinctively wine-like flavor. But you do not tell
us _exactly what it is_ about A and B that would (or indeed _could_ ), when
they are combined, generate this vibrant red color.”",362
"This response is confused. It is irrelevant whether you can point to facts
about A and B that illuminate why they generate redness when combined. _For_
** _I_** _was the one offering a positive argument that A and B cannot
generate redness_. And my argument **assumed** that there **couldn’t** be
anything about A and B that can combinedly manifest some feature not
individually found in either. You then pointed out that my argument **needs**
to assume this in order to succeed, but that absolutely **no** reason was
provided for such an assumption. And you pointed to a case wherein precisely
this ‘manifesting of a feature not individually found in any of the
constituents’ occurs in order to bolster the _in principle legitimacy_ of this
kind of phenomenon. My argument does nothing to rule this out in the case of
A, B, and C, and yet ruling this out is precisely what **needs** to be done
for my argument to work. So, my argument fails. And for the same reason,
Feser’s argument fails. [The case of A, B, and C is structurally identical to
the dialectic with Feser’s PPC argument.]",1087
"Feser: “Another problem is that even if substantial form and prime matter
_would_ together yield something with existential inertia, that would just
leave us with another version of the circularity problem discussed above.
Existential inertia, as a power or property of the whole substance, would
depend for its existence at any moment on the parts of the substance (prime
matter and substantial form) being combined; and the parts of the substance
being combined at any moment would depend on its power or property of
existential inertia. (As I have said before, there really is no way around
this sort of problem for anything that is composed of parts. Only an
absolutely simple or non-composite thing can have existential inertia.)”",735
"But I have already shown in [Part
5](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/09/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-vicious-circularity-and-the-metaphysics-of-eit-part-5/)
why this objection fails, and so it’s clearly false that there is no way
around this problem.",275
"Feser: “Now, toward the end of his paper, Schmid does say something that might
seem to provide a solution to this circularity problem. He says that it is the
parts of a substance _at time t – 1_ that explain the whole’s existence at
_t_. But there would be vicious circularity only if it were the parts _at time
t_ that were claimed to explain the whole’s existence at _t_.",373
"But this simply ignores the sub-argument of the Aristotelian proof, referred
to above, which claims that even considered at time _t_ , the parts of the
water (or of any other physical substance) considered _just qua parts of the
kind they are_ (particles, prime matter and substantial form, essence and
existence, or whatever) are merely potentially water, so that some additional
factor active _at t_ must be brought in to account for why they are actualized
as water at _t_. What happened at an earlier time _t – 1_ is not sufficient to
account for that. But if the additional factor is some other part of the water
itself, then we will be back with the circularity problem.”",677
"But I have already addressed Feser’s argument here in my [lengthier blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/). For one thing, I’ve already explained why the
explanatory facts adduced in each of Explanans 1 and Explanans 2 **do**
suffice to explain Explanandum, i.e., S’s existence at m. And so Feser’s claim
that past things don’t suffice is false. But for those who haven’t read my
lengthier blog post, I do want to address exactly what Feser says in his
Aristotelian proof chapter by way of justifying the explanatory insufficiency
of past things.",612
"In the Aristotelian proof chapter, all we’re offered by way of justifying the
claim that what happened prior to t is insufficient to explain why the water
exists at t, as far as I can tell, is the following passage:",215
"“[I]t is that matter’s potential to exist as _water_ that is being actualized
right now. Why? It is no good to answer that such-and-such a process occurred
at some time in the past so as to combine the hydrogen and oxygen in just the
right way. That tells us how the water _got_ here, but that is not what we are
asking about. It is also no good to point out that nothing has yet come along
to separate out the hydrogen and oxygen. That tells us how the water might
someday go out of existence, but that isn’t what we’re asking about either.
What we’re asking about, again, is what _keeps_ the water in existence at any
instant at which it does in fact exist. ” (2017, p. 26)",675
"But this amounts to simply _asserting_ that the appeal to past things is
insufficient to explain the present existence of the water; it is hardly a
_justification_ for it. The philosopher who thinks that the existence of S at
moment m is adequately explained by the conjunction of |(i) S existed
immediately before m and (ii) nothing destroyed S from then through m| will
simply say: “Au contraire; on my view, these **do** suffice to explain it.
Nothing you say in the quoted passage gives me any reason to think my
proffered explanation is inadequate. You can retort that it’s ‘no good’, but
you need to **show** why it’s no good. My view is _precisely_ one according to
which the conjunction of (i) and (ii) tells us not merely how the water got
here, and not merely how the water might go out of existence, but also _why
the water exists at m_. All you have done is simply asserted that the
conjunction of (i) and (ii) doesn’t tell us why/how the water exists at m.
_But that’s precisely my view_. And merely asserting a denial of my view is
hardly grounds for rejection of said view. And note, moreover, that the onus
in the present dialectical context is **not** on me to positively demonstrate
why (i) and (ii) suffice to explain S’s existence at m; rather, **you** are
the one giving a positive argument here, and hence **you** are the one who
needs to give **me** sufficient reason to think my view is **false**. **I** do
not, in this context, need to _positively justify_ why **my** view is
**true**. I need only point out that **you** haven’t proven it **false**.”

nothing Feser says on behalf of premise (7) gives those who **do** think past
things sufficiently explain the present existence of S sufficient reason to
**abandon** their position.]",578

that, for all I have shown, _existential inertia itself_ might be a further
internal principle of a substance. Hence, he claims, the premise begs the
question.",238

naturalist who argues as follows:",109
"_The physical world consists of nothing more than fermions and bosons and the
laws that govern them. But there is nothing in the nature of fermions and
bosons or the laws that govern them that entails that they have existential
inertia. Hence, there is no such feature in the physical world._",292
"Whatever you think of such an argument, would it beg the question? Not if the
speaker has independent grounds for being a reductive naturalist. Hence, in
response to such a reductive naturalist, a defender of EIT would either have
to give some argument against reductive naturalism, or show that the
conclusion does not follow from the premises. It would not be enough merely to
accuse the speaker of begging the question. But by the same token, my argument
does not beg the question _if_ I have independent grounds for being a
hylemorphist, which I do. Hence, even if Schmid had other good reasons to
reject the argument, accusing step 7 of begging the question is not a good
one.”",682

Feserian fashion, suppose I respond:",108

argument, an atheist would either have to give some argument against theism,

enough merely to accuse me of begging the question.”",360
"This response is confused. And yet it is precisely the response Feser has
given to my charge of question-begging. It is irrelevant whether the
**proponent** of the argument has independent reasons for accepting one of the
premises. What matters, instead, is whether the argument — its premise(s) and
that which is said on their behalf — gives those who **don’t already accept
it** sufficient reason to **abandon** their position. And the job of the
detractor of the argument is **not** to give some argument _against_ the
premise, i.e., some argument positively justifying its denial. Feser’s
response, then, fails.",615
"Feser: “Schmid’s fourth objection to my argument claims that if it succeeded,
it would take down EET as well as EIT. For why would a material substance’s
substantial form and prime matter give it a tendency to _expire_ any more than
they give it a tendency to _persist_? But Schmid’s objection misunderstands
the position of those who reject EIT and endorse EET. Their claim is not that
material substances _have_ an intrinsic tendency to _go out_ of existence.
It’s rather merely that they _lack_ any intrinsic tendency to _continue_ in
existence.",548
"Schmid considers this response, and says in reply that it presupposes that the
falsity of EIT gives us reason to believe EET, which, he claims, it does not.
But I have already explained above why he is wrong about that. The falsity of
EIT _does_ in fact give us reason to endorse EET.”",285

point here.",198

positive intrinsic tendency to go out of existence, then that would be enough
to vindicate EIT. But that doesn’t follow at all. Again, the _lack_ of a
tendency to _persist_ in existence is by itself sufficient to undermine EIT.”",299
"What? This is **NOT** what I suggest. I am genuinely baffled (but not, at this
point, _surprised_ ) at this misrepresentation. (I don’t think it’s
**intentional** misrepresentation. But it’s misrepresentation nonetheless.)
Let’s see what I actually write at this stage of the paper:",282
"Notice what I **actually** claim: “So if Feser claims EET is vindicated by the
absence of a tendency to persist, it will follow that EIT is equally
vindicated by the parallel argument that things have no tendency to expire.”",224

my criticisms of Beaudoin’s account of EIT in the paper was precisely that the
mere absence of a tendency to expire is insufficient for EIT. That is an
explicit denial of what Feser attributes to me. See, for instance:",447
"So, Feser has blatantly misrepresented me yet again. At this point, though,
I’m not surprised.",94
"Finally, I will note, in connection with Feser’s claim that ‘the _lack_ of a
tendency to _persist_ in existence is by itself sufficient to undermine EIT’,
that this is false — I have explained many different accounts of inertial
persistence in this series that don’t ontologically commit to some (intrinsic)
tendency to persist but are still inertialist-friendly. So after
misrepresenting me, Feser made a false claim.",418
"Feser: “(Compare: If there is nothing intrinsic to me that allows me to see as
far as a mile, then I am simply not going to see as far as a mile, unless some
additional factor – such as a telescope – is brought into the picture. The
mere absence of some factor that prevents me from seeing that far – such as a
barrier – is not going to suffice for me to see that far. Similarly, the mere
absence of a positively self-destructive tendency is not going to suffice to
ensure that I continue in existence.”",503
"I had already made the exact same response to Beaudoin. And yet Feser presents
this as if it is a response to what I said. [Indeed, it **is** a response to
the claim Feser **attributed** to me, but ironically I never made that claim
and, indeed, **explicitly denied** that claim in my article.]",294
"Feser: “If there is nothing intrinsic to me that positively ensures that I do
continue in existence, then I am simply not going to continue in existence,
unless some additional factor – an external sustaining cause – is brought into
the picture.)”",247
"I have already explained why this is false. There are whole swathes of
extrinsic, inertialist-friendly explanations of persistence.",131
"Feser: “Yet as we have now seen in two detailed posts, those arguments are
seriously problematic – being sometimes unclear in their formulation, begging
the question, and, in some cases, beholden to straw men and red herrings. But
as I have said, Schmid is an intelligent fellow and he certainly tries to
engage his opponents’ arguments in a serious and civil way, and for that I
thank him.”",391
"As we’ve seen in my first post and in my detailed series of responses to
Feser, my arguments are not problematic. Almost none of Feser’s responses
succeeded, and indeed they were rife with misunderstandings of the dialectical
context, misrepresentations, and missed points. But, of course, Feser is an
intelligent man and he certainly tried to engage my arguments in a serious and
civil way, and for that I thank him.",417

# Feser on Schmid on Existential Inertia: On Length | Part 1,60
"Posted on [July 6,
2021](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/06/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-part-1/ ""10:26 pm"") by  [Majesty Of
Reason](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/author/majestyofreason/ ""View
all posts by Majesty Of Reason"")",258
"Feser has recently [responded](http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2021/07/schmid-
on-existential-inertia.html) to my [IJPR
article](https://philpapers.org/archive/SCHEIA-20.pdf). I will respond to his
post in a series of blog posts. This post is Part 1, which addresses Feser’s
complaints about the length of [my previous blog post
reply](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-
the-aristotelian-proof/) to his first blog post.",453
I have multiple things to say in response to Feser’s complaints.,64
"**First** , on countless occasions, there is a ‘multiple-paragraphs-to-one-
sentence correspondence’ between my response and his blog post. This is
altogether unsurprising: it takes Feser one sentence to mischaracterize one of
my points in my Sophia article as a conditional claim, or to misrepresent the
points I say on behalf of my account of per se chains, or to mistakenly allege
questions begged, or to gesture towards pages in his book where he addresses
things, or to intimate/hint/suggest that I’m behind sock puppetry. [Let me be
loud and clear: I do not claim Feser **intentionally** or **deliberately**
misrepresented me. Feser is a man with integrity, and so I am well-nigh
certain these are **unintentional** and **not deliberate**.] But it takes
multiple paragraphs to explain what’s wrong with each of these. For instance:
(a) in a case of misrepresentation (of which I documented numerous in the
previous blog post — cf. Section 3), I have to spell out exactly why it’s a
misrepresentation, what I actually said, and so on, and this requires multiple
paragraphs; (b) in a case of mistaken allegations of questions begged (of
which I documented many in the previous blog post — cf. Section 3), I have to
explain the dialectical context at hand, who has the onus of justification,
why my response, given the dialectical context, does no such thing, and so on.
Again, this takes multiple paragraphs; (c) in the case of Feser gesturing
towards pages in his book and urging that I need to respond to the arguments
therein, it takes me multiple paragraphs to explain Feser’s arguments on those
pages and then critically assess them; and (d) in the case of sock puppetry, I
have to explain why such a hypothesis is obviously wrong.",1740
"Also, as I pointed out many times in the blog post, I had already made many of
the points in a much briefer manner in my section “Dialectical Context” in the
Sophia article. But that didn’t prevent misunderstandings of the dialectical
context from arising, and so I had to step back and explain things with
concrete examples, like the example of the Even-Number-Quarkist argument.",380
"**Second** , my posts have a multiplicity of purposes. I explained in my blog
post that my aim was not merely to respond to Feser; it was also to make the
post a one-stop-shop for the breadth of criticisms of the Aristotelian proof
I’ve leveled. Different sections signal different purposes — that is well-nigh
universally understood. And I was explicit that I had one section on Feser’s
blog post. The rest were to either set the stage or to facilitate my other aim
of making my post a one-stop-shop of my criticisms of the Aristotelian proof.
Indeed, I repeatedly signal throughout my post a multiplicity of aims, only
one of which was responding to Feser. Not long after uploading the post,
moreover, I added a paragraph explaining this point:",746
"**Finally** , if Feser wants a shorter section to read whose sole aim was to
directly reply to Feser’s blog post, he can read Section 3 of my post. Therein
I point out that none of Feser’s responses to my article succeed.",221
"“Since the notion of existential inertia seems to be at the core of our
disagreement, and since I take it to be a reasonable assumption that this
article contains Schmid’s most rigorous presentation of his views on that
topic (and that his latest blog post presupposes the article in any event), I
take that to be a reasonable way to conclude our exchange for now. Fair
enough?”",378
"**First** : I don’t see this as fair. What’s fair is for Feser to read the
much shorter Section 3 of my blog post [much of which is just quoting Feser’s
blog post — I quote and respond to nearly every sentence/paragraph]. It is not
fair to ignore the fact that Feser misrepresented me on multiple occasions,
clearly misunderstood the dialectical context with his allegations of
question-begging, and so on.",406
"**Second** : It isn’t my most rigorous presentation of my views. Indeed, in my
previous blog post, I pointed out that I’ve considerably developed my views
since that paper and even disagree with [or, perhaps more accurately, would
_modify_ ] some portions of the discussion. I was a baby [well, teenage]
scholar when I wrote that paper — my first ever paper. Naturally, my views
have become much more nuanced, precise, and well-thought-out since then. In
this series, I’ll point out those modifications where and when they may arise.",533
"My most recent and rigorous articulation of my views on EIT are in two papers
under review. I’ve extracted some of the key points in the following
documents, in case anyone is interested. And no, I am not demanding that Feser
read these, and nor am I saying Feser has to read or respond to these in order
to make his case. They’re included because they are far more developed than my
IJPR paper, and they contain my actual — occurrent, present — views about EIT.
They articulate EIT under various different spacetime structures, explore a
whole host of inertialist-friendly explanations of persistence not contained
in my IJPR article, and more.",645
"Metaphysical accounts of inertial persistence are explanations of objects’
persistence that are inertialist-friendly (i.e., under which EIT is or can be
true). Here are documents wherein I develop numerous such metaphysical
accounts: (a) tendency-disposition accounts
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j1xevd_Z8YlOoLj__8nom-

Explaining Inertial Persistence | Part 2",116

"Feser has recently [responded](http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2021/07/schmid-
on-existential-inertia.html) to my [IJPR
article](https://philpapers.org/archive/SCHEIA-20.pdf). I will respond to his
post in a series of blog posts. Check out [Part 1
here](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/06/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-part-1/). This post is Part 2, which deals with some of
Feser’s claims about my characterizations of EIT and EET and more.",465
"“Arguments for God’s existence like the Aristotelian proof I defend in chapter
1 of [_Five Proofs of the Existence of God_](https://www.amazon.com/Five-
Proofs-Existence-Edward-
Feser/dp/1621641333/ref=pd_sim_14_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=JBGA9F0R86NCQBXMT2ZJ)
(and which was discussed in my previous post on Schmid) are concerned in part
to show that EIT is false and EET is true. Now, Schmid writes as if the
falsity of EIT and truth of EET are _presuppositions_ of such arguments. That
is not correct. Rather, a critique of EIT and defense of EET are _parts of_
such arguments, not undefended background _assumptions_ of such arguments.”",643
"**First** , let’s see what I actually said: “an argument one of whose premises
presupposes the falsity of P-EIT and the truth of EET” (p. 203). Here, I point
out that **one of the premises** presupposes the falsity of EIT. And that is
obviously true: premise (7) in Feser’s Aristotelian proof does not **justify**
the negation of EIT but rather merely **assumes** it. To be sure, Feser
attempts, in chapter 1 of his book, to defend this assumption and to justify
premise seven. But nowhere did I deny that. What I said was that one of the
**premises** presupposes the falsity of EIT. And this is straightforward and
obviously true. I did NOT claim that it is an ‘undefended background
assumption of the argument’. I simply said one of the **premises** assumes the
falsity of EIT. This is utterly separate from the question about _whether the
argument as a whole_ — including, of course, that which is said on behalf of
the premises in chapter 1 — unjustifiably assumes this. Thus, Feser is just
wrong and has mischaracterized my claim.",1035
"Here, I point out that one of the **premises** has the presupposition. Yes, in
the next sentence, I say ‘the argument presupposes the falsity’, but I was
intending the second sentence to be read in light of the first wherein I make
the point in a more technical manner. (Moreover, notice what I say in that
second sentence: *if* one can show that the presupposition is not adequately
justified. This shows beyond reasonable doubt that by ‘the argument’s
presupposition’ I do not _simply mean_ ‘unjustified background assumption of
the argument’. For if I did mean that, then the antecedent of the conditional
would be utterly trivial.)",635
"**Second** , ‘presupposition’ can be interpreted either as ‘assumes without
justification’ or else simply ‘requires’. Feser interprets me as saying the
former, but I don’t see any reason we should interpret me saying as much. In
fact, this is an uncharitable assumption. For I quite literally go on in the
article to examine precisely what Feser says, in his chapter and in his 2011
article, by way of justifying premise (7). It would be really strange if I
meant by ‘presupposition’ in my paper ‘an undefended background assumption of
the argument’ given that I go on to point out how the denial of EIT isn’t an
undefended background assumption of the argument. [Now, what I will say is
that I likely _should_ have written ‘requires’ instead of ‘presupposes’, since
the latter can be ambiguous. But that, of course, doesn’t excuse taking the
uncharitable reading. Moreover, the fact that I say ‘if one can show that the
presupposition is not adequately justified’ shows that I mean ‘requirement’ by
‘presupposition’, since if I instead meant ‘assumes without justification, my
antecedent would be trivial. So the uncharitable charge stands.]",1142
"So far, Feser has mischaracterized me and uncharitably read me. Off to a good
start.",84
"**Third** , let us suppose (contrary to what I’ve argued) that both of my
above two points are wrong. That is, let’s suppose that I not only applied
‘presuppose’ to the entire argument and what is said on its behalf but that I
also contradicted myself in the article by using ‘presuppose’ to mean ‘has as
an unjustified background assumption’. **Even still** , I would argue that it
**is** correct to say that the argument unjustifiably assumes the falsity of
EIT. To be sure, there is an _attempt_ at justifying it. But as I explained in
Section 3 [And section 4.1, but that is supplemental] in my [lengthy blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/), the attempt fails and still ultimately rests on a mere
assumption of EIT’s falsity. And so even if my first two points failed, I am
not incorrect, _pace_ Feser.",874
"To see why such attempts still ultimately assume (rather than properly
justify) EIT’s falsity, let’s again have a look at what Feser says in his
chapter on behalf of premise (7).",178
"Consider, for instance, that in the Aristotelian proof chapter, all we’re
offered by way of justifying the claim that what happened prior to t is
insufficient to explain why the water exists at t, as far as I can tell, is
the following passage:",244
"“[I]t is that matter’s potential to exist as _water_ that is being actualized
right now. Why? It is no good to answer that such-and-such a process occurred
at some time in the past so as to combine the hydrogen and oxygen in just the
right way. That tells us how the water _got_ here, but that is not what we are
asking about. It is also no good to point out that nothing has yet come along
to separate out the hydrogen and oxygen. That tells us how the water might
someday go out of existence, but that isn’t what we’re asking about either.
What we’re asking about, again, is what _keeps_ the water in existence at any
instant at which it does in fact exist. ” (2017, p. 26)",675
"But this amounts to simply _asserting_ that the appeal to past things is
insufficient to explain the present existence of the water; it is hardly a
_justification_ for it. The philosopher who thinks that the existence of S at
moment m is adequately explained by the conjunction of |(i) S existed
immediately before m and (ii) nothing destroyed S from then through m| will
simply say: “Au contraire; on my view, these **do** suffice to explain it.
Nothing you say in the quoted passage gives me any reason to think my
proffered explanation is inadequate. You can retort that it’s ‘no good’, but
you need to **show** why it’s no good. My view is _precisely_ one according to
which the conjunction of (i) and (ii) tells us not merely how the water got
here, and not merely how the water might go out of existence, but also _why
the water exists at m_. All you have done is simply asserted that the
conjunction of (i) and (ii) doesn’t tell us why/how the water exists at m.
_But that’s precisely my view_. And merely asserting a denial of my view is
hardly grounds for rejection of said view. And note, moreover, that the onus
in the present dialectical context is **not** on me to positively demonstrate
why (i) and (ii) suffice to explain S’s existence at m; rather, **you** are
the one giving a positive argument here, and hence **you** are the one who
needs to give **me** sufficient reason to think my view is **false**. **I** do
not, in this context, need to _positively justify_ why **my** view is
**true**. I need only point out that **you** haven’t proven it **false**.”
[For a more fleshed out discussion of transtemporal explanatory accounts of
EIT, check out [this document
here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_r4u8vkQ_4D6HwKL-
Mkn20ieJ_i_e13O/view?usp=sharing).]",1774
"Finally — and note that I do not need to do this for my criticism to succeed —
here is a plausible [to my mind at least] _positive justification_ as to why
something like (i) and (ii) **do** suffice to explain S’s existence at m. For
S to **fail** to exist at m despite existing from [m*, m), m* < m, is for some
**change** to occur.[Fn] But a change occurs only if some factor causally
induces said change. Hence, if no factor causally induces a change, then the
change won’t occur. Thus, if no factor causally induces S to fail to exist at
m despite existing from [m*, m), then S exists at m. Once we add that nothing
came along to causally induce this — that is, once we add that nothing came
along to destroy S from m* to m — it simply follows that S exists at m. [Cf.

"Here, we seem to have a perfectly respectable, perfectly legitimate
explanation of S’s existence at m. And this does, indeed, tell us how S exists
at m. That was a straightforward deduction of the explanatory facts cited
[namely, (i) S existed immediately before m, (ii) nothing causally induced S’s
cessation at m [i.e., nothing destroyed S from the immediately prior moment(s)
through m], and (iii) a change occurs only if some factor causally induces
said change]. And so we do, indeed, have sufficient explanation for S’s
existence at m, one that doesn’t adduce some extrinsic sustaining efficient
cause. For me at least, the explanation certainly seems to remove mystery as
to why/how S exists at m. And unlike what allegedly afflicts the explanatory
facts adduced in the quoted passage above from Feser (2017, p. 26), the
present explanation **does** , indeed, tell us how S exists at m. [I discuss
and defend EIT-friendly explanations of persistence along similar lines in

dig deeper.]",1224
"“For example, in the course of developing the Aristotelian proof, I point out
that a substance like the water in question is _composite_ in nature, i.e. it
is made up of parts. There are different ways you could conceive of these
parts – for example, in terms of substantial form and prime matter (if you are
an Aristotelian hylemorphist), or in terms of essence and existence (if you
are a Thomist metaphysician), or in terms of fundamental particles (if you are
a metaphysical naturalist). It doesn’t matter for the specific purposes of the
argument. What matters is only that the parts, considered _just qua parts of
that kind_ at _t_ , are only _potentially_ water at _t_ , and that some
additional factor is therefore needed in order to explain why this potential
is actualized at _t_. That they made up water at _t_ – 1 is irrelevant,
because what matters is why they continue to make up water at _t_ , and again,
nothing about the parts _considered by themselves_ can account for that. Hence
we need to appeal to some additional factor.”",1044
"I have already addressed a well-nigh identical [in semantic/argumentative
content] paragraph in Section 3 of my lengthier blog post. That other
paragraph of Feser’s was:",169
"“The basic idea is this. Consider a collection of particles of type _P_ which
constitute water at time _t_. Though they actually constitute water at _t_ ,
there is nothing in the particles _qua particles of type P_ that suffices to
make them water rather than one of the other alternatives mentioned. Again,
_qua particles of type P_ they have the potential to constitute water, or
separate quantities of hydrogen and oxygen, or some other substance or
aggregate of substances. So, there must at _t_ be something distinct from the
collection which actualizes its potential to be _water_ , specifically.”",603
"Now, as I pointed out in my previous blog post, there are at least three
problems with this.",92
"**First** , the implicit causal principle adduced in this paragraph is simply
not the causal principle articulated and defended in (2017, ch. 1). I actually
addressed a nearly-identical point in my original manuscript for the Sophia
article, but that manuscript was almost 11k words in total, and Sophia was
extremely strict about making the article less than 8k words. Naturally, then,
I chopped stuff, and addressing a nearly-identical point to Feser’s present
point was left on the chopping board. Nevertheless, I saved the portion of the
paper, and I shall articulate right now what I said therein.",602
"One might say that the water’s existence consists in or results from a
reduction of potency to act in the sense that some of the _essential parts_ of
water—its underlying matter, say, or its constituent molecules and atoms and
whatnot— _could be otherwise_ , such that the water _could fail to exist_. If,
for instance, the oxygen and hydrogen atoms were separated, the water wouldn’t
exist. Because the essential parts of water have the potential to be otherwise
(e.g., to make up something other than water, or to be absent from reality
altogether), it follows that the water has some potential to exist which is
realized or actualized as opposed to other potentials that aren’t realized or
actualized.",704
"But, crucially, this is _not_ the kind of ‘potency-to-act-reduction’ that
Feser needs for his argument to get off the ground. _Nowhere_ in Feser (2017,
ch. 1) does Feser justify a causal principle to the effect that ‘if there are
a range of potentials p1, p2, … pn, only one of which can be actual[ized] (at
a given time), and one of them, pi, is actual[ized] (at a given time), then
there is some (sustaining) cause which makes pi actual (at a given time).’",458
"One reason this couldn’t be the causal principle at play in the Aristotelian
proof is that it would straightforwardly debar the inference to a _purely_
actual being. For suppose that the unactualized actualizer is simply a
_necessary_ but non-purely-actual being, A. In that case, it is simply _false_
that there are a range of potentials when it comes to the very _being_ ,
_existence_ , or _actuality_ of A, since A is _necessarily actually existent_.
It thus has no potential pertaining to its very substantial being or existence
(e.g., potentials to cease to exist, to begin to exist, or to be absent from
reality altogether). Thus, if the causal principle at play in the Aristotelian
proof _were_ the one previously articulated, then the Aristotelian proof would
be incapable of justifying the need for a sustaining, actualizing cause of A.
(Why? Because the antecedent of the causal principle is simply false when it
comes to A’s very being or existence—there isn’t a range of potentials
concerning A’s very substantial existence. And so one cannot infer, solely _by
means of_ said causal principle, that A has a cause of its existence.) And if
the Aristotelian proof were incapable of justifying the need for a sustaining,
actualizing cause of A, then it simply couldn’t show that the unactualized
actualizer is _purely_ actual, since—for all the argument shows— _A_ could be
the unactualized actualizer, and A is _not purely actual_.",1441
"A second reason the aforementioned causal principle couldn’t be the one at
play in the Aristotelian proof is that it is simply not one that Feser
articulates or defends in his (2017, ch. 1). Instead, Feser argues that _any
change—any actualization of potential or reduction from potency to
act—requires a causal actualizer_ (2017, pp. 19-22). But this is crucially
different from the earlier causal principle, since the earlier makes no
reference to _change_ but instead merely to _cross-world difference_ : if one
possibility among a range of incompatible possibilities is actual, then there
must be some cause that explains why the actual possibility is, well,
_actual_. This is a stronger principle than the principle that _changes_
require causes.",751
"**Second** , the inference to the claim captured in “So…” is a non-sequitur.
[Granted, Feser is giving a _basic idea_ and so not intending to justify or
fully flesh out the relevant inferences contained therein. But registering the
problems afflicting the basic idea illustrates the work that needs to be done
in a more fleshed out formulation.] Merely from the facts that the collection
_as such_ ( _qua_ collection) does not suffice for the collection’s actually
constituting water at t, the only thing that follows is that there must be
some _other_ sufficient condition(s) for the collection’s constituting water
at t. What _doesn’t_ follow is that this other sufficient condition(s) is a
_sustaining/conserving actualizing cause_. I would argue that the only thing
needed as the other sufficient condition(s) is simply an _explanation_ of why
the collection constitutes water at t. But there are whole swathes of
explanations of why the collection constitutes water at t that don’t adduce
some outside sustaining or conserving efficient cause. I alluded to one of
them in [Part 1](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/06/feser-on-
schmid-on-existential-inertia-part-1/) based on causally inducing changes of
state, but in case you’re curious, here’s a summary of some other explanatory
avenues:",1308

EIT).",459
"To be sure, there are more besides. I’m simply giving you a flavor of the
explanations on offer that make no appeal to conserving or sustaining causes.

_needs_ to do this or _should_ do this if he wants to respond to me further.
They’re included for those who want to dig deeper into inertialist-friendly
explanations of persistence.]",411
"**Third** — and this is kinda double counting, but I deem it important enough
to separate as a distinct objection in its own right — the very causal
principle Feser implicitly adduces in the relevant passage seems to undermine
the Aristotelian proof. For the causal principle at hand — to reiterate what I
said above — would straightforwardly debar the inference to a _purely_ actual
being. For suppose that the unactualized actualizer is simply a _necessary_
but non-purely-actual being, A. In that cause, it is simply _false_ that there
are a range of potentials when it comes to the very _being_ , _existence_ , or
_actuality_ of A, since A is _necessarily actually existent_. It thus has no
potential pertaining to its very substantial being or existence (e.g.,
potentials to cease to exist, to begin to exist, or to be absent from reality
altogether). Thus, if the causal principle at play in the Aristotelian proof
_were_ the one Feser seems implicitly to adduce in the quoted passage, then
the Aristotelian proof would be incapable of justifying the need for a
sustaining, actualizing cause of A. (Why? Because the antecedent of the causal
principle is simply false when it comes to A’s very being or existence—there
isn’t a range of potentials concerning A’s very substantial existence. And so
one cannot infer, solely _by means of_ said causal principle, that A has a
cause of its existence.) And if the Aristotelian proof were incapable of
justifying the need for a sustaining, actualizing cause of A, then it simply
couldn’t show that the unactualized actualizer is _purely_ actual, since—for
all the argument shows— _A_ could be the unactualized actualizer, and A is
_not purely actual_.",1699
"Think about it this way. It was _precisely because_ the collection ( _qua_
collection) did not suffice for the collection’s actually constituting water
that — by Feser’s lights — there must be some sustaining or actualizing cause
[apart from the collection itself] of the collection’s actually existing as
[constituting] water. But this motivation for a sustaining cause is simply
irrelevant if there _is_ some fact about the entity in question ( _qua_ that
entity) that suffices for its existence. And this is precisely what I and a
whole host of other non-classical-theists [both non-theists and non-classical
theists] think is the case: the foundation of reality is one or more
fundamental, _necessarily existent_ entities with potentials for accidental
[though obviously not substantial] change. It is simply false, of such
entities, that no fact about them suffices for their existence. This is unlike
the case of the collection. Thus, even granting that the collection needs a
sustaining or conserving cause, the very motivation that led Feser to _demand_
such a sustaining cause undercuts his inference to the _pure_ actuality of the
unactualized being.",1160

there seems to be a difference between potentialities in the sense relevant to
change (potentialities across time) and the “potentialities” Feser needs to
make an argument against Existential Inertia (potentialities in the way
something could be right now, at a specific point in time, *rather than* the
future). But that’s something I’ll be coy about for now since I’m writing a
bit on the topic 😉 With that said, I read your linked Google Drive paper and
it seems like if Feser doesn’t agree with you, he certainly ought to give
Benocci a look. I know Feser responds to Beaudoin in his article in Neo-
Scholastic Essays, but Benocci’s essay was written well after NSE was
published, and seems to argue for the doctrine of Existential Inertia from a
‘dispositions’ perspective that’s pretty similar to Feser’s Aristotelianism,

*changing into* something, but simply a negation of its existence (at the
respective time). If change is the realisation of some perfection (actuality)

"Interesting. While this does deserve some deeper consideration, my initial
response is that it simply doesn’t pass the smell test. When things go out of
existence, everyone thinks a change has occurred some way or another. Imagine
you’re at a party with a bunch of people, and then the lights go out. When
they come back on, someone is dead (a la the _Clue movie). It would be absurd
if everyone just stood around saying, “huh, nothing’s changed at all!
Everything is just like it was before the lights went out. No mystery here!”
If Feser, or any other Aristotelian, would deny that destruction, or passing
out of existence, is a sort of change, they need a much stronger argument
because that premise is so odious to common sense._",733

"The point is that Feser’s analysis of change as the transition from
potentiality to actuality (which is *granted* by Schmid here) excludes ceasing
to exist as being a change, since non-being (the term of this “change”) is not
a state of actuality. Sure, you can object that this is metaphysically
pedantic and based on a controversial metaphysic. But common sense does not
*define* change as the actualisation of a potential.",425
"But, even apart from that, it’s not clear that common sense views ceasing to
exist as a change. Common sense would certainly claim that a change involves
changing from A to B. If B, though, doesn’t exist (as non-being doesn’t) then
can something change from A to B (can you go from New York to Narnia?). And if
it can’t, how can going from A – B be a *change*?",360
"Moreover, the examples of ceasing to exist which common sense would regard as
changes are examples where the matter of a prior substance becomes the matter
of a new substance (death of a living thing, for example). On an Aristotelian
view, that is an example of *substantial change*; the change involved here is
not a substance S going from being to non-being, but rather than matter going
from ‘having such-and-such a form’ to ‘having such-and-such other form’.",462

can’t go from New York to a nonexistent place, but that’s a change in
location. What about other types of change? Say you have two apples in your
bag, and I steal them both. In other words, the number of apples has gone from
2 to 0, and obviously, 0 means zilch, nada, nothing, no apples exist in the
bag, *your apples are nonexistent* because I stole them. But that’s obviously
a change, you wouldn’t believe me if I said, my face stuffed with my ill-
gotten gains, that a numerical change from 2 to zero isn’t actually a change
at all, so your bag is in the exact same state it was before I helped myself

"# Feser on Schmid on Existential Inertia: EIT, Entailment, and Extrinsic
Explanation | Part 3",93
"Posted on [July 7,
2021](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-part-3/ ""11:32 am"") by  [Majesty Of
Reason](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/author/majestyofreason/ ""View

"Feser has recently [responded](http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2021/07/schmid-
on-existential-inertia.html) to my [IJPR
article](https://philpapers.org/archive/SCHEIA-20.pdf). I will respond to his
post in a series of blog posts. Check out [Part
1](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/06/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-part-1/) and [Part
2](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/06/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-part-2/). This post is Part 3, which deals again with
Feser’s false (and misrepresentative, and uncharitable) claim that I claim
that his Aristotelian proof assumes, without justification, the falsity of
EIT. It also deals with the entailments of EIT.",700
"“You may or may not agree with this argument. (In my previous post on Schmid,
I defend it against an objection he raises against it.)”",134
"And in Section 3 of [my lengthier blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/), I argued that Feser’s defense fails.",176
"Feser: “But it is precisely an _argument against EIT and for EET_. For it
entails that the water will not continue to exist from _t_ – 1 to _t_ unless
something acts to keep it in existence. Hence Schmid is wrong to say that the
Aristotelian proof (of which this argument is a component part) merely assumes
EET.”",313
"But I am not wrong here, because **that’s not what I claimed.** I showed in
Part 2 that Feser has both mischaracterized me and read me uncharitably here.
And I also explained that even if (as is contrary to fact) he neither
mischaracterized me nor uncharitably read me, my claim is still correct. See
[Part 2](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/06/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-part-2/).",408
"Feser: “(Moreover, the whole point of my _ACPQ_ article [“Existential Inertia
and the Five
Ways”](https://www.pdcnet.org/scholarpdf/show?id=acpq_2011_0085_0002_0237_0267&pdfname=acpq_2011_0085_0002_0237_0267.pdf&file_type=pdf)
is to show that, properly understood, Aquinas’s Five Ways – the first of which
is a version of the Aristotelian proof – are _arguments against EIT_. Schmid
cites this article in his own paper, which makes it is especially odd for him
to write as if my arguments simply _assume_ the falsity of EIT.)”",526
"I have already explained why I did not claim that Feser’s arguments simply
_assume_ (without justification) the falsity of EIT. And this is obviously
true when one inspects what I actually wrote in my IJPR paper, as I explained
in [Part 2](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/06/feser-on-schmid-
on-existential-inertia-part-2/). This makes it especially odd for Feser to
write as if I claimed, in my IJPR paper, that Feser’s arguments simply
_assume_ (without justification) the falsity of EIT.",504
"Feser: “Schmid also claims that the rejection of EIT does not entail accepting
EET. Consider again the example of the water. If we reject EIT, Schmid thinks,
all that follows is that the water _will not of necessity continue to exist_
without a sustaining cause. But it doesn’t follow that it _will of necessity
go out of existence_ without one. It might simply _happen_ to carry on without
one.",395
"Feser is incorrect here. For it is demonstrable that the mere negation of
P-EIT does not entail the truth of EET as I spelled them out in my paper.
Let’s see why.",162
"The negation of P-EIT says that it is not necessarily the case that objects
persist in the absence of destruction.",114
"It is simply a fact of logic that the negation of P-EIT is consistent with the
following claim:",95
"CLAIM: It is possibly the case that objects persist in the absence of
destruction.",82
"If we let ‘objects persist in the absence of destruction [i.e., the absence of
destruction is by itself sufficient for objects’ persistence]’ be ‘p’, then we
have:",163
"The logical form of ~P-EIT is: ~□p, which is equivalent to ◊~p",62
"Now, it is, again, simply a fact of logic that ◊~p and ◊p are consistent.",73
"But CLAIM is not consistent with EET. CLAIM says that, possibly, the absence
of destruction is by itself sufficient for persistence. According to EET,
however, it is necessarily the case that objects cease in the absence of
sustenance, in which case it is necessarily true that the absence of
destruction is not by itself sufficient for persistence (since the object
needs to be _sustained_ in addition). This has the form of □~p. Since CLAIM
says that, possibly, the absence of destruction is by itself sufficient for
persistence, CLAIM is equivalent to: it is not necessarily the case that the
absence of destruction is not by itself sufficient for persistence. So, CLAIM
is equivalent to ~□~p. Hence, EET is □~p whereas CLAIM is ~□~p. That’s
inconsistent. Hence, CLAIM is not consistent with EET.",799
"Hence, ~P-EIT is consistent with CLAIM, but CLAIM is inconsistent with EET.
But it is a simple fact of logic that if **q is consistent r** and **r is
inconsistent with s** , then **q does not entail s**. For suppose the
antecedent of that conditional is true. Now suppose, for reductio, that q
entails s. Since s is inconsistent with r, s entails ~r. So, q entails ~r (by
transitivity of entailment). But this is to say that q and r are not
consistent. But we are supposing that q is consistent with r. Contradiction.
Hence, our assumption for reductio is false. So, q does not entail s. Hence,
from the truth of the antecedent we derived the truth of the consequent.
Hence, the conditional claim is true. Hence, if **q is consistent r** and **r
is inconsistent with s** , then **q does not entail s**.",802
"But it was shown above that ~P-EIT is consistent with CLAIM whereas CLAIM is
inconsistent with EET. So, ~P-EIT does not entail EET.",131
"So, I’ve shown that ~P-EIT does not entail EET. But Feser claimed I was wrong
in making this claim. So, Feser is wrong.",119
"This shows that what Feser goes on to say after ‘this too is not correct’, in
connection with justifying this claim, is moot (to quote Feser). But,
nevertheless, let’s consider it.",180
"Feser: “If the water continues to exist from _t_ – 1 to _t_ , then something
must account for this fact, and it will have to be something either intrinsic
to the water or extrinsic to it.”",188
"What? The claim Feser is supposed to be evaluating is my claim that **~P-EIT
does not entail EET**. Feser is here adding an **auxiliary thesis** — that
something must explain the fact that the water continues to exist. But Feser
is **NOT** supposed to be evaluating the claim that the **conjunction** of
(~P-EIT & <something must explain the fact that objects persist>) does not
entail EET. **I never claimed anything about this conjunction**. It is trivial
that you can add auxiliary theses to ~P-EIT to entail EET. No one denied that.
My claim was, instead, that **~P-EIT** does not entail EET. Feser can add an
auxiliary thesis to ~P-EIT to derive EET if he wants, but then he is obviously
not targeting my claim. And yet that is precisely what he was supposed to be
doing — he is supposed to be explaining why **my claim** is “not correct”.",844
"Feser: “Now, if EIT is false, then it is not something intrinsic to the water;
and if there is no sustaining cause, then it will not be something extrinsic
to it either.”",170
"This is false. It is false that if there is no sustaining cause at t [or from
(t-1) to t, which I shall hereafter drop], then the explanation for an
object’s existence at t will not be something extrinsic to the object at t.
For there are whole swathes of explanations of an object’s persistence that do
not adduce sustaining causes and yet adduce facts extrinsic to the object
itself at t.",390
"Consider, for instance, one of the explanations I proffered in section 3 of my
[lengthier blog post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-
on-schmid-on-the-aristotelian-proof/) and which I adumbrated in the previous
post:",239
"For S to **fail** to exist at m despite existing from [m*, m), m* < m, is for
some **change** to occur.[Fn] But a change occurs only if some factor causally
induces said change. Hence, if no factor causally induces a change, then the
change won’t occur. Thus, if no factor causally induces S to fail to exist at
m despite existing from [m*, m), then S exists at m. Once we add that nothing
came along to causally induce this — that is, once we addd that nothing came
along to destroy S from m* to m — it simply follows that S exists at m. [Cf.
Section 4.1 in the [lengthier blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/) for more on this line of thought.]",713
"Here, we seem to have a perfectly respectable, perfectly legitimate
explanation of S’s existence at m — and this explanation adduces facts outside
of or extrinsic to S at m. And the explanation does, indeed, tell us how S
exists at m. That was a straightforward deduction of the explanatory facts
cited [namely, (i) S existed immediately before m, (ii) nothing causally
induced S’s cessation at m [i.e., nothing destroyed S from the immediately
prior moment(s) through m], and (iii) a change occurs only if some factor
causally induces said change]. And so we do, indeed, have sufficient
explanation for S’s existence at m, one that doesn’t adduce some extrinsic
sustaining efficient cause. For me at least, the explanation certainly seems
to remove mystery as to why/how S exists at m. The present explanation
**does** , indeed, tell us how S exists at m. [I discuss and defend EIT-
friendly explanations of persistence that adduce facts extrinsic to S at m
along similar lines in [this document
here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VJylrJ-8olSgbUUf6m0FOeSP-
RrrJJO_/view?usp=sharing) on no-change accounts. And again, Feser need not
engage with this document if he responds. I include it for those who want to
dig deeper.]",1226
"Or consider inertialist-friendly explanations based on [laws of
nature](https://drive.google.com/file/d/186uxfg9LzO_DuZFHjn1qjN828KzJhKsW/view?usp=sharing),
which adduce facts extrinsic to S at m. Or consider inertialist-friendly
explanations based on [transtemporal explanatory
relations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_r4u8vkQ_4D6HwKL-
Mkn20ieJ_i_e13O/view?usp=sharing), which adduce facts extrinsic to S at m. Or
consider an explanation by appeal to the de dicto necessity of the inertial
thesis (à la [propositional necessity
accounts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XBxLyZNpKyvXHyJ8e91C_OrER3Wn60N-/view?usp=sharing)).
And on and on. Feser’s claim is just false.",672
"Feser: “But then there will be nothing to account for its continuing to exist
from _t_ – 1 to _t_ , in which case it will not continue to exist. Which is
precisely what EET claims. So, if we reject EIT, then we must indeed affirm
EET.”",235
"But we’ve already seen that (i) Feser has added an auxiliary thesis to ~P-EIT
to derive EET, and hence he has NOT shown that ~P-EIT by itself entails EET
(which was the claim he is **supposed** to be evaluating), and that (ii) his
derivation contains a false claim, to wit, the false claim that if there is no
sustaining cause at t, then the explanation for an object’s existence at t
will not be something extrinsic to the object at t.",436
"Feser: “A critic might respond that this presupposes the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR). Well, since I think PSR is true and have defended it
at length in several places, I hardly think that is a problem. But in fact the
argument does not presuppose PSR – or to be more precise, it doesn’t
presuppose PSR any more than any other explanation does. Homicide detectives,
insurance investigators, and forensic engineers never take seriously the
suggestion “Maybe it just happened for no reason!” when considering the
phenomena they are trying to understand, and that is so whether or not they
are committed to the principle that absolutely _everything_ has an
explanation. Similarly, we needn’t appeal to such a principle in order to
judge that the rejection of EIT should lead us to embrace EET.”",799
"But the criticism that I’ve leveled, at least, is not that the argument merely
presupposes the PSR or something like it. The criticism instead is that Feser
was **supposed** to be addressing my claim that ~P-EIT does not entail EET.
But then to address this claim, he only argued that **adding an auxiliary
hypothesis** to ~P-EIT entails EET. That wasn’t my claim, and I never denied
the trivial fact that one can add an auxiliary thesis to ~P-EIT to entail EET.",462
"One might object: isn’t your post here just pedantic and irrelevant logic-
chopping? How does any of this matter?",113
"I see it as neither pedantic nor irrelevant or insignificant. There is a
purpose behind it, and I take the purpose to be obviously significant. What is
that purpose? I’ll spell it out briefly.",192
"Remember my point: the mere fact of denying P-EIT doesn’t deliver (i.e., allow
us to derive or establish or logically infer the truth of) EET. This means
that it is not enough merely to deny P-EIT if we want to deliver or establish
EET. Feser wants to deliver or establish EET. So it is not enough for Feser
merely to deny P-EIT. So if Feser wants to succeed in delivering or
establishing EET, he must adduce and defend some philosophically substantive
auxiliary thesis or theses added to the denial of P-EIT. This is quite clearly
a significant result, one that some may not have seen originally and one that
some may have thought unnecessary. [Some may have thought it would be enough
merely to reject P-EIT.]",711
"And this discovery especially helps us focus precisely on those substantive
auxiliary theses and whether or not they are true/defensible. And that’s
precisely what I went on to do with Feser’s proffered auxiliary theses: one of
Feser’s theses was a PSR or PSR-like explanatory principle, which I accept;
but another one of his theses was that if there is no sustaining cause, then
there is no extrinsic explanation. And I argued against this. Nothing is
pedantic or irrelevant here. It is a significant point that some
philosophically substantive auxiliary thesis or theses needs to be conjoined
to a mere denial of P-EIT to deliver EET. It helps us see connections between
ideas, clears up the dialectical context [i.e., helps us see what one needs to
do if one wants to establish EET], allows us to identify the dialectical role
the auxiliary theses play and what they need to add to ~P-EIT to deliver EET,
and finally sets the stage for and facilitates our focus on such auxiliary
theses. Nothing pedantic or irrelevant here.",1028
"In Part 4 of this series, I’ll address the next part of Feser’s post.",69
"[Fn] I addressed an objection to this argument based on the claim that
cessation isn’t a change in [Section 4.1.2 of my lengthier blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-

(not sure if I posted my comment correctly previously so I try again),69
"You have characterised Existential Inertia Thesis (EIT) in your journal paper
this way:",87
"“Necessarily, concrete objects (i) persist in existence (once in existence)
without requiring a continuously concurrent sus- taining cause of their
existence and (ii) cease to exist only if caused to do so.”  
[equivalence: (ii)… if caused to cease existence.”]",261
"If we look at the above statement carefully, it appears to be semantically
equivalent to its rival thesis Existential Expiration Thesis (EET)!!!",144
"Therefore even if the above EIT is true, it seems to support Prof Feser’s
Aristotelian Proof, or at least on the part about EET. Let me explain.",144
"A wooden table’s continuation in existence is CONTINUOUSLY conditional on the
presence of many conditions, such as the existence of space (space cannot be
taken for granted; around 13.7 billion years ago the available space was not
enough even for a molecule to exist in) and the existence of suitable
temperature around the table (if the surrounding temperature is too high the
wooden table would cease existing; it would then become burnt charcoal).",451
"So a table’s continuation in existence obviously requires the CONTINUOUS
presence of various conditions.",104
"Remove any one of the necessary conditions, and the wooden table would cease
existing as a wooden table.",104
"If one says that the removal any of the necessary conditions is equivalent to
the table being “caused to cease existence”, then I would suggest that the
EIT’s qualifying phrase “unless caused to cease existence” seems to be
semantically equivalent to “unless any of the sustaining conditions ceases to
be present to sustain the existence” of the table.",352
"It appears to be a matter of EIT and EET using different expressions to
describe the SAME UNDERLYING PHENOMENON.",112
"This means EIT is ultimately equivalent to its supposed rival EET (Existential
Expiration Thesis): the table’s continuation in existence CONTINUOUSLY
requires the CONTINUOUS presence of various conditions.  
[we can even include “not being caused to cease existence” as one of the
conditions]",292
"If we are not bewitched by the labels “EIT” and “EET” but to look at the
substance behind the labels, then the key issue is expressed by this more
neutral expression: whether a wooden table’s ability to persist in existence
is CONTINUOUSLY conditional on the presence of various conditions.",290
"I doubt anyone can rationally deny the empirical fact that a wooden table’s
existence continuously requires the continuous presence of various conditions.  
(It does not matter if one calls the removal/absence of any such conditions as
“causing it to cease existence” or “ceasing to sustain its existence”)",306
"I would further suggest that to say “a wooden table’s persistence in existence
continuously requires the continuous presence of various conditions” is
equivalent to saying “a wooden table’s persistence in existence continuously
requires the continuous actualisation of the relevant potentiality of the
wood”.  
[“continuous presence of all necessary conditions” is equivalent to
“continuous actualisation of the relevant potentiality”]",435
"If the above is correct, then:  
A wooden table’s act of persisting in existence is conditional on the
CONTINUOUS actualisation of the underlying wood’s potentiality of existing as
a wooden table.",196
"In summary, the key underlying issue behind the EET/EIT seems to be whether or
not a wooden table’s ability to continue existing  
(a) is absolutely unconditional  
or  
(b) is continuously conditional on the presence of various conditions.",240
"Feser proof partly depends on (b) being true. And (b) seems to be empirically
true.",83

dialectical context. In particular, P-EIT and EET reveal that Feser’s premise
seven is not adequately justifed solely by rejecting P-EIT. For the denial of
P-EIT simply amounts to its not being necessary that temporal objects persist
without causal sustenance. But this neither means nor entails EET. All it
means is that it is possibly false that temporal objects persist of their own
accord—and this doesn’t entail that things of necessity will be instantly
annihilated in the absence of existential causal sustenance.”",591
"If we pay attention to the reasoning here, as well as the careful
italicization of the modal operators in the original article, we can see that
I was simply making a point about the modal operators of possibility and
necessity not allowing us to infer EET from the negation of P-EIT. I obviously
wouldn’t deny that one can add an auxiliary thesis to ~P-EIT to derive EET.

the substance of your argument getting lost in a sea of irrelevant, pedantic
nonsense. Anyhoo! If you wanted to be able to justifiably claim the right to
bluster on about the triviality of Feser’s objection in light of the
dialectical context, maybe here’s what you should have said:",439
"“Let’s turn now to the second point of emphasis concerning the dialectical
context. In particular, P-EIT and EET reveal that Feser’s premise seven is not
adequately justifed solely by rejecting P-EIT, AT LEAST IN THE FOLLOWING
NARROWLY LOGICAL SENSE. For the denial of P-EIT, FROM A NARROW, STRICTLY
LOGICAL STANDPOINT (I.E., LOGICAL NEGATION), simply amounts to its not being
necessary that temporal objects persist without causal sustenance. But this
KIND OF NARROW STRICTLY LOGICAL NEGATION OF P-EIT neither means nor entails
EET (NOT THAT THIS PEDANTIC POINT ABOUT THE RESULT OF LOGICAL NEGATION IS AT
ALL GERMANE TO THE ACTUAL PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUE IN QUESTION). All it (I.E., MERE
LOGICAL NEGATION) means is that it is possibly false that temporal objects
persist of their own accord—and this doesn’t entail that things of necessity
will be instantly annihilated in the absence of existential causal
sustenance.”",916
"To which Feser would presumably have responded something like: “So what? I
have no dispute with you or anyone else the general nature of logical
entailments from negations. But the substantive philosophical issue is not
about the strictly logical negation of P-EIT, and the entailments of that
negation (why would it be??); it’s about a philosophically substantive
rejection of P-EIT that entails — so I argue — the truth of EET.”",430

"First, I am happy to admit that I could have added greater clarity to the
relevant paragraph when writing the article that I was talking about logical
entailment.",162
"But, second, given that this was not done, I take it to be reasonably obvious
that I was making a point about logical entailment. After all, ‘entails’ has a
pretty standard meaning in philosophy, and this standard meaning is precisely
logical entailment. (Or so it seems to me having read countless philosophical
works that employ the word and unanimously mean ‘logical entailment’ by it.)
Moreover, I was keen to italicize (and, hence, emphasize) the modal operators,
and I informally talked through a logical derivation. This quite decisively
shows that I was talking about logical entailment.",595
"And, third, it is false that this is pedantic or not germane to the
philosophical issue in question. It shows that merely arguing against P-EIT,
one doesn’t thereby establish EET. One would have to add some philosophically
interesting auxiliary thesis. This is obviously not a pedantic point, and it
is obviously germane to the philosophical issue in question.",360

"Dude, you can be as bloody-minded about it as you want, the fact remains that
no matter how many times you’ve read the word ‘entail’ in contexts where it
refers to strict logical entailment, the word ‘entail’ per se flat out does
not mean ‘strict logical entailment’ — it just means entail (and go ahead
consult a good dictionary if you need the details spelled out)! So again, this
kind of pedantic quibbling is irrelevant, a distraction, and a waste of time.
But have at it, if that’s how you wanna roll!",506
"So here’s a challenge for you: I claim this argument simply misses the target,
it is irrelevant. So here’s a way to test that claim, instead of just being
bloody-minded about it: Go on over to Feser’s blog and make this one narrow
point there. I’ll bet he responds, and then we’ll see what traction your point
has. Maybe it turns out you’re right, maybe not; but I think you’re much more
likely to learn something from the exchange rather than carrying on with the
pedantic grandeur (is that fair? — maybe, maybe not) of your lengthy
monologues. In a way I think you’re a high-minded fellow, and maybe you think
it’s enough to win your arguments in the world of forms; but try bringing them
down to the world of dialogue, where you have to test them step by step
against the competing arguments and rebuttals of other intelligent people, who
are just as interested as you in the world of forms and might actually also be
able to help you to arrive there yourself in an effective, expeditious
fashion.",1000

"If you want to think it’s irrelevant or pedantic, I can’t stop you. But I see
it as neither. There is a purpose behind it, and I take the purpose to be
obviously significant. What is that purpose? I’ll spell it out briefly.
Remember my point: the mere fact of denying P-EIT doesn’t deliver (i.e., allow
us to derive or establish the truth of) EET. This means that it is not enough
merely to deny P-EIT if we want to deliver or establish EET. Feser wants to
deliver or establish EET. So it is not enough for Feser merely to deny P-EIT.
So if Feser wants to succeed in delivering or establishing EET, he must adduce
and defend some philosophically substantive auxiliary thesis or theses added
to the denial of P-EIT. This is quite clearly a significant result, one that
some may not have seen originally and one that some may have thought
unnecessary [some may have thought it would be enough merely to reject P-EIT].
And this discovery especially helps us focus precisely on those substantive
auxiliary theses and whether or not they are true/defensible. And that’s
precisely what I went on to do with Feser’s proffered auxiliary theses: one of
Feser’s theses was a PSR or PSR-like explanatory principle, which I accept;
but another one of his theses was that if there is no sustaining cause, then
there is no extrinsic explanation. And I argued against this. Nothing is
pedantic or irrelevant here. It is a significant point that some
philosophically substantive auxiliary thesis or theses needs to be conjoined
to a mere denial of P-EIT to deliver EET. It helps us see connections between
ideas, clears up the dialectical context [i.e., helps them see what they need
to do if they want to establish EET], allows us to identify the dialectical
role the auxiliary theses play and what they need to add to ~P-EIT to deliver
EET, and finally sets the stage for and facilitates our focus on such
auxiliary theses. Nothing pedantic or irrelevant here.",1946

"I think I agree with almost all of that, except for your claim that it isn’t
irrelevant or pedantic. So what divides us, apparently, is our respective
criteria for irrelevant pedantry. So maybe you’d like to say something about
that. My take is this: Just as I agree with all of the obvious general points
about logic and dialectical context that you make, so, I believe, would your
primary interlocutor (Feser). Or do you think otherwise?? As I say, try him!
So unless I am mistaken about Feser, your rehearsing all of these obvious
general points on which you and your interlocutor already agree is pointless,
pedantic, and irrelevant. It does nothing to advance the discussion, because
it has nothing to do with the real point of contention between you. And if you
doubt what I say, again: TRY him! Dare to enter into a real dialogue with the
man on the point. Just this one point. Then you can get back to your
monologuing. (I’ll add that I don’t agree with your general position, but I’m
not really comfortable with Feser’s response to it either, so I’d sincerely
like to see the both of you, highly intelligent and well-informed as you both
are, get together and engage in some actually constructive back-and-forth.)

"Feser has recently [responded](http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2021/07/schmid-

article](https://philpapers.org/archive/SCHEIA-20.pdf). I will respond to his

3](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-part-3/). This post is Part 4, which deals with the prior
or intrinsic probability of P-EIT and EET as well as Feser’s summary of my
paper’s stage-setting.",713
"Feser: “A third claim Schmid makes about EIT and EET is that neither has a
presumption in its favor, so that we ought initially to be agnostic about
which is correct. _A priori_ , they are evenly matched.”",205
"This is one part of my paper that I have come to disagree with. For I now
think EIT is **far better** than EET when it comes to prior or intrinsic
probability [or _a priori plausibility_ , to use Feser’s phrase — one I’m
happy to use]. One key determinant of prior/intrinsic probability is
simplicity. And unless I have overlooked something, it is clearly true that
EIT is simpler than EET. For one thing, EET requires a categorically different
kind of causation in our ontology [namely, sustaining causation]. EIT does not
by itself require this. For another thing, EET is going to require a
categorically different kind of being in our ontology [assuming, as I take to
be innocuous in this dialectical context, the impossibility of infinitely
descending per se chains of causal dependence]. In particular, EET is going to
require there to be at least one timeless being that sustains temporal things
in existence. EET is thus committed not only to all the temporal entities EIT
is committed to, but it also includes more entities (a timeless entity), more
kinds of causation (sustenance or conservation from without, as well as
timeless-to-temporal causation), and more fundamental [i.e. not-reducible-to-
other] kinds of entities (reality is fundamentally divided at least into
timeless/immutable concrete things and temporal/immutable concrete things),
and so on. This makes EET much more complex than EIT and hence much less
intrinsically probable. [Fn]",1458
"I also want to pinpoint another way in which I would modify the IJPR paper. In
particular, I say therein that “Consider again P-EIT and EET. In particular,
notice that they exactly parallel one another. Their ontological commitments
are exactly parallel (each committed to a particular kind of tendency within
temporal objects)”. This, I don’t think, is right. First, I seem to speak in
this passage as if a ‘tendency’ is some metaphysically heavyweight thing, such
as a dispositional property of something. But that is a commitment of neither
P-EIT nor EET. In particular, they can both be read in ways that don’t
ontologically commit to some ‘tendency’ — this can be read in a metaphysically
lightweight way. [For those interested, cf. my discussion of [tendency-
disposition accounts
here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j1xevd_Z8YlOoLj__8nom-
dgaObTnRV8/view?usp=sharing) for more on this.] Second, it is wrong that the
two theses have the same commitments. As I showed in the previous paragraph,
_EET has many, many more commitments_. In any case, my
modifications/corrections only strengthen my paper’s case.",1116
"[Fn] Note that when philosophers speak of fundamental kinds of things in the
context of theoretical virtue comparison, they simply mean kinds of things
that are not analyzable in terms of or reducible to other kinds of things.
This is a separate issue from one such fundamental kind of thing [e.g.
temporal things] standing in a causal dependence relation to another such
fundamental kind of thing [e.g., a timeless thing or things].",433
"But Feser thinks I’m mistaken for another reason, and I will argue that he is
mistaken in this regard.",102
"Feser: “This too, I would argue, is mistaken. To take an example I have often
used, suppose you explain, to someone who has never heard of them before (a
young child, say), the nature or essence of a lion, of a Tyrannosaurus Rex,
and of a unicorn. Then you tell him that, of these three animals, one exists,
one used to exist but has gone extinct, and the other never existed and is
fictional. You ask him to tell you, based on his new knowledge of the essences
of each, which is which. Naturally, he couldn’t tell you. For there is nothing
in the essence or nature of these things that could, by itself, tell you
whether or not it exists. Existence is something _additional to_ the essence
of a contingent thing. It doesn’t follow from such a thing’s essence.”",761
"Suppose I grant this. All the child should conclude is that — precisely
because there is nothing about a contingent thing [or its nature] that tells
us whether it exists — there must be some other factor that explains why the
contingent thing exists. In other words, we need some reason why the
contingent thing is in reality at all. But this, of course, is an entirely
separate question from why, _once in existence_ , the thing _continues to
exist_.",451
"And, indeed, I would argue that the _a priori_ considerations strongly favor
EIT. Consider this dialogue between me and the child from earlier.",143
"**Joe** : Suppose something S exists immediately before a given moment m. Now,
for S to fail to exist at m despite existing immediately before m is for some
kind of change to occur. Of course, it’s not as though S undergoes some change
in this process, since S doesn’t become something different. But still, there
is some kind of change here, whether in the ontological inventory of what
there is, or whether in the incorporation of what were previously S’s parts
into parts of something else, or whether in the passing away of a state, or
whatever. [See Section 4.1.2
[here](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-
the-aristotelian-proof/) for more on this objection.]",698
"**Joe** : But changes of state (i.e., cases where some new state comes to be
or some old state passes away) plausibly require some cause. It’s not as
though a raging tiger could just spring into existence in this room right now;
that would require some cause.",259
"**Joe** : So, if there is no cause that induces the relevant change of state,
then there won’t be such a change.",112
"**Joe** : So, if there is no cause that induces S to cease to exist at m —
that is, if there is nothing that comes along to destroy S — then S will not
cease to exist at m. And in that case, S will persist to m. For you granted
earlier that S’s failing to exist m despite existing before m constitutes some
kind of change. In particular, it’s a change of state in the sense of an old
state passing away. And in that case, we get the conclusion that so long as
nothing destroys S from immediately before m through m, then S will exist at
m. We derived this in a manner that removes mystery as to why and how S exists
at m.",621
"In this (obviously gerrymandered) conversation, we have a seemingly perfectly
illuminating inertialist-friendly explanation of why S exists at m once S is
in existence. The explanation tells us precisely how and why S exists at m.
And whether or not existence follows from what a contingent thing is is not
relevant to this point.",330
"Feser: “This is, of course, an argument Aquinas gives for the Thomistic
doctrine of the real distinction between essence and existence (which I
develop and defend in chapter 4 of _Five Proofs_ ). The point for the moment
is this. If nothing about the essence or nature of a thing entails that it
_exists at all_ in the first place, then it is hard to see how anything about
its essence or nature could entail that will _persist in existence_ once it
does exist.”",462
"Maybe so. But nothing in the exchange above, for instance, assumes that it was
something about the essence or nature of the contingent thing which explains
why the object persists. Totally separate explanatory facts were cited. And so
this point doesn’t support the denial of EIT, which is what it would need to
do in order for Feser to substantiate his claim that EET is better off than
EIT in terms of their ‘a priori matchup’ (as it were).",442
"Feser: “In short, the very nature of a contingent thing qua contingent makes
it implausible to attribute to it a feature like existential inertia. In which
case, EET is, contra Schmid, _a priori_ more plausible than EIT.”",221
"I have already shown why this is mistaken. First, none of the explanatory
facts cited in my conversation with the child involved facts about the essence
or nature of a contingent thing explaining why it persists. And there are
whole swathes of inertialist-friendly explanations of persistence, as we saw
in previous posts in this series, that likewise make no appeal to the nature
of contingent things. I have also already explained why existential inertia
isn’t a ‘feature’ or ‘attribute’ of things in Section 3 of [my lengthier blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/). (And even those who accept a tendency-based account of
EIT where things have the tendency by nature [cf. [some tendency-disposition
accounts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j1xevd_Z8YlOoLj__8nom-
dgaObTnRV8/view?usp=sharing)] should not be convinced by what Feser says. They
will simply say ‘if you leave off a tendency to persist in your description of
their essences, then you have simply given the child an incomplete
description’.)",1073
"Finally, suppose — contrary to what I argued — that Feser did show or render
plausible the claim that contingent things do not enjoy existential inertia.
As I point out in a footnote of my IJPR paper and explain in more detail in
Section 4.1 of [my lengthier blog
pos](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/)t, in principle EIT (or _an_ EIT) can quantify over a
_subset_ of temporal concrete objects. And so the inertialist may very well
hold that contingent things uniformly fail to enjoy inertial persistence, but
that there is nevertheless some foundational necessarily existent temporal
concrete object or objects upon which non-foundational contingent concrete
objects depend. (Theist-friendly examples include the neo-classical or
panentheistic temporal God, while non-theist-friendly examples include one or
more foundational quantum fields, or a spatiotemporal wavefunction [cf.
Section 4.3.8 of [my lengthier blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/)], or a collection of fundamental particles, what have
you.] In this case, it is _false_ that nothing about the necessary foundation
demands its existence or its persistence; indeed, the opposite is true. Hence,
even if — contrary to what I argued — Feser’s argument succeeds, the
inertialist can still maintain a version of EIT. (To be sure, Feser might try
to adduce other arguments claiming that only the classical theistic God could
be necessarily existent. But that is a separate argument from the one under
present consideration, and my sole purpose here is to point out that the the
argument under present consideration need not move an inertialist to abandon
their position. And there’s also the fact that there are responses to such
arguments that, by my lights at least, succeed.)",1866
"Feser: “In summary, then, in the first, stage-setting part of his paper,
Schmid makes three dubious claims: that the falsity of EIT and truth of EET
are simply taken for granted by the Aristotelian proof (not true);”",216
"Let’s also summarize: in Feser’s assessment of the stage-setting part of my
paper, he both mischaracterized and read uncharitably what I said about the
presupposition of EIT, and even if he didn’t, my point still stands [cf. [Part
2](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/06/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-part-2/)]. So his first point here is simply false.",374
"Feser: “that the falsity of EIT does not give us reason to believe EET (not
true);”",83
"And I already addressed Feser’s allegations in this regard in [Part
3](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-part-3/), showing that they don’t work. Hence, Feser is
wrong to claim that what I said here is false.",262
"(I am assuming that by ‘does not give us reason’, Feser means ‘does not give
us **adequate** reason’ (instead of meaning ‘does not give us **any**
reason’), since nowhere did I say that the negation of P-EIT does not give us
**any** reason to believe EET.)",256
Feser: “and that EIT and EET are equally plausible _a priori_ (not true).”,74
"I have already shown why Feser’s responses to my claim here fail. See the
paragraphs above. But Feser is (accidentally) right here — my claim that
they’re equally plausible _a priori_ is not true. As I explained above, EIT is
_much more plausible_ than EET _a priori_!",268
"Feser: “So unpromising a beginning does not portend well for the rest of the
paper, and indeed further serious problems with it arise immediately.”",147
"And an unpromising beginning to Feser’s blog post, rife as it was with false
claims and misrepresentation, does not portend well for the rest of his blog
post, and indeed further serious problems with it arise immediately — problems
to which I will turn in Part 5 of this series.",279

"I doubt there are too many kid’s who’d be able to make sense of this, lol. I
know ‘ontological inventory’ wasn’t in my vocabulary before I hit puberty, and
for quite a while afterwards.",185
"Still, jokes aside, I get what you’re saying, and IMO it is a fatal or neat-
fatal blow to the Doctrine of Divine Conservation that Thomists haven’t really
grappled with. I brought up pretty much the same point to grenjib earlier, if
you noticed:",246
"Like he said, “For S to cease to exist is not the same as S *changing into*
something, but simply a negation of its existence (at the respective time).”
But like I said, this simply doesn’t seem to be how most people regard change.
As my lighthearted reply alluded to, if someone “went out of existence” (i.e
died) at a party, we’d certainly say a change occurred, and we’d certainly
want an explanation for that change. Now, grenjib responded by saying that was
an example of substantial change–a person turning into a corpse (so to speak),
not nothing at all. But as I also responded, referring to yet another comment
from Johannes, Thomists seem to think of those kinds of substantial changes as
the original thing passing out of existence. As he implied, if a table
undergoes a substantial change into a pile of charcoal, we take it as the
table having passed out of existence, no longer being here, and so on.",914
"If I were to put it in as simple a (VERY informal) syllogism as I could, I’d
say this: The Aristotelian account of change implies inertia of actuality,
which thus implies existential inertia. I’m 99% sure this is the point you’re
reaching at, so I hope you find this useful 🙂",275
"1: Any potentiality something has MUST be actualized by something else that’s
already actual.  
2: If something exists right now, it has the potentiality to not exist.  
3: Thus, going from premise one, something’s potentiality to not exist MUST be
actualized by something else.",278
"A whimsical example to show this: I’m actually alive right now, and my
potentiality to be dead (i.e to go out of existence) must be actualized by an
actual, real threat. I could be killed by an actual bullet or an actual
nuclear bomb or an actual bolt of lightning, but in any case, my potentiality
to not exist (since in actuality I exist right now) needs to be actualized by
something else with a capability of killing me.",424
"But all this seems to imply another axiom: Something that is actual (in some
way or another) will remain actual in that way unless something else actual
does something to change that, namely actualize one of its other
potentialities.",233
"This is apparent when we unpack premise 1 above a little more. Potentialities
are grounded in actualities–for instance, if a red ball has the *potentiality*
to be blue in the future, it must first actually exist AND it must first
actually be red. But if its potentiality to be blue needs something else to
actualize it, that implies the ball’s actuality of being red has a sort of
inertia–the ball won’t just become blue for no reason, it’ll remain red unless
something changes it–i.e I actualize its potentiality to be blue by painting
it.",540
"But if this is so, we have a perfect argument for existential inertia.
Something that exists will continue to exist because its “potentiality to not
exist” must be actualized by something else–namely an active destructive
cause, like you mention. QED. Thanks, Aristotle!",270

"EIT and EET seems to be simply two different ways of describing the SAME
UNDERLYING PHENOMENON: the ability of a conditionally existing entity such as
a wooden table (or a cup of coffee beverage, or a hardcopy book ) to
persist/continue in existence is CONTINUOUSLY conditional on the presence of
various CONCURRENT conditions.  
[eg CONCURRENT conditions such as the continuation in: (a) the presence of
space, (b) the presence of correct range of surrounding temperature, (c) the
presence of appropriately bonded atoms, and so on.]",533
"To the EIT proponent, the removal of one of these conditions is described as
“causing that entity to cease existence”.",118
"To the EET proponent, the SAME removal of one of these conditions is described
as “ceasing to sustain that entity’s existence”.",127
"Ultimately, Prof Feser’s type of Aristotelian proof (or some other
cosmological proofs that start from the empirical fact that a conditionally
existing entity’s existence is CONTINUOUS LY conditional on some CONCURRENT
conditions) does not seem to depend on whether EIT or EET is true, because
both EIT and EET are describing the same underlying phenomenon.",357
"As long as the underlying phenomenon is true, the issue of EIT vs EET does not
seem to obstruct or defeat such cosmological proofs.",131

"Thanks for your reply. The problem with this “concurrent conditions” argument
is that it flatly doesn’t work for the more fundamental “components” of
reality you speak of. It makes sense to say that the existence of a man or an
ice cube or a table is “actualized” by concurrent conditions because the
nature of all those physical things entails they can only exist *under
specific conditions*–it is the nature of a man to require oxygen (for
instance), the nature of water to become liquid or gas at higher temperatures,
the nature of a table to require a specific gravity to avoid being smushed (a
wooden table would be smashed into noexistence on Jupiter, for instance), and
so on.",683
"You’ll notice that in all of those examples I made it clear that *specific
external conditions* were responsible for existence or destruction of these
particular things. I never attributed their contingency to something as vague
as “the distinction between their essence and existence,” which is what Feser
needs to get his argument against existential inertia off the ground. It’s
easy to see why a table or something might be “contingent” *upon* the
existence of space or temperature or whatnot. But what, precisely, are space
or temperature contingent on? How could one destroy those things? Temperature,
for instance, is “contingent” on atomic motion, and atoms are “contingent” on
quarks, I suppose. But what are quarks contingent on? As far as I know
nobody’s ever shown them to be destroyed under any circumstances, which means
they must possess existential inertia of some sort. The only thing the Thomist
can say is that “oh, quarks are ~*composites*~ of act and potency and/or
essence and existence” or something like that, but this doesn’t convince me
that existential inertia is false, it just convinces me that there is
something very, very suspicious about the Thomistic account of composition and
the definition of existence–but that would be a far longer topic so I shall
stop here.",1298

that the above series of conditions is currently fulfilled at this moment.
This fulfillment of all the conditions in the above series entails that the
above series of conditions is not endless but ends in a last condition
Condition N. (An endless series of conditions is impossible to be fulfilled
and this would then mean the coffee beverage is impossible to exist now which
clearly contradicts the empirical fact of the existing coffee beverage.)",526
"[Another reason why there exists a last member in the above series: The above
series is an essentially ordered dependency series and every essentially
ordered dependency series has a last member.]",196
"Since Condition N is the last member of the series, this means Condition N’s
existence is not conditional on any condition (otherwise it would not be the
last member in the series). Hence Condition N exists unconditionally as an
Unconditionally Existing Entity. This is a rough idea of my Premise 3:",299

Therefore at least one Unconditionally Existing Entity exists extra-mentally.",98
"If my above three premises are true and if the implicit reasoning structures
are valid deductive structures, then the “Part 1 Conclusion” is impossible to
be false. In that case, the rest of the tasks would be to analyse the nature
of this Unconditionally Existing Entity to see if there is one and only one
such entity, and if it is indeed the Sustainer of everything else that exists

conjoining of “unconditional existence” and feature X. UEE would then NOT be
existing unconditional upon any condition. But from our earlier 1st
conclusion, UEE’s existence is NOT conditional on any condition at all.

of describing what is equivalent to, or else what entails from, “unconditional
existence”.",314
"UEE is unconditional on or unconstrained/unconditioned by anything means UEE
is not constrained or conditioned by space. UEE is not existing in space. UEE
is not located at this spatial location or that spatial location. UEE just
exists.  
(No condition attached.)",264
"UEE is also not constrained by time. It does not exist in this or that
temporal location or any temporal location. UEE just exists.  
(No condition attached.)",158
"UEE is not constrained to exist with this kind, or that kind, or any kind of
matter/energy/physicality. UEE is non-physical. *UEE just exists.*  
(No condition attached.)",170
"For there to be two or more UEEs, there must be a difference between them. In
other words, some conditions must exist that differentiates one UEE from
another UEE, such as this UEE is located at this spatial/temporal location
while the other UEE is located at at least a slightly different
spatial/temporal location, or there is at least a slight difference in shape.
colour, size or physicality/energy/matter between one UEE and another. Or this
UEE is “unconditional existence + feature X” while the other UEE is
“unconditional existence without any feature X”.",563
"But UEE exists without any qualifying condition so there is in principle no
difference at all between two or more hypothetical different UEEs. UEE is
simply “unconditional existence without any second feature and without any
constraining factor be it space, time, matter/energy or anything at all” and
another hypothetically second UEE is also “unconditional existence without any
second feature and without any constraining factor be it space, time,
matter/energy or anything at all”.",485
"So no difference can exist between the hypothetical two UEEs. The hypothetical
two UEEs are the same “single” UEE. Therefore given the nature of UEE, there
can only be one UEE in the whole of reality.",200
"3rd Conclusion:  
There exists, and can exist, one and only one UEE. There is only one entity
that is existing unconditionally.",127
"Given that there exists one, and can exist only one, unconditionally existing
entity, this means all other entities is impossible to exist unconditionally.
So all other entities can exist only conditionally on one or more conditions.",233
"4th Conclusion:  
Except for UEE, all other entities exists conditionally.",74
"Since all other entities exists conditionally, every other entity’s existence
is continuously conditional on one or more series of conditions. Ultimately
EVERY such series of conditions would terminated in the same one and only UEE.
Hence the same one and only UEE enables or sustains the existence of all other
entities.",321
"5th Conclusion:  
Ultimately the one and only one UEE CONTINUOUSLY enables or sustains the
existence of all other entities. There exists one Enabler or Sustainer of all
other entities.",184
"[BTW notice also this:  
Except for UEE, all other entities at best possess only Conditional
Existential Inertia. Only UEE has Unconditional Existential Inertia, in the
sense that Unconditional Existential Inertia is another way of describing
UEE’s feature of “unconditional existence”.",286
"Given all that is said so far, quarks cannot be that one and only one UEE.
(Quarks comes in and out of existence, and that there are different quarks
conditioned in different spatial and temporal locations.)",207

annihilation and corruption of particles… If proponents of existential inertia
were to propose that a particle has more than one inherent tendency, either
the tendency to exist or to cease to exist, then the question becomes why it
selects one over the other at any given moment in time. This reason cannot be
internal to the particle; since then one or other of the options would be
forced. Neither could it be external to the particle without denying
existential inertia. The only option remaining is that there is no reason, and
that the universe is fundamentally irrational; an proposition that I think all
scientists would find objectionable… In a quantum world, then existential
inertia seems to a have problem, while divine conservation is fully consistent
with it. One cannot postulate that things have an inherent tendency to
continue to exist in the same state when they don’t always continue to exist
in the same state, even when there is no physical interaction. There are,
however, various ways in which the advocate of existential inertia might try
to avoid this. The only one that seems plausible to me (that there is an
external non-physical cause for the change) is functionally equivalent to
divine conservation.”

enough, fulfill more than a few of your requirements for having existential

everywhere (omnipresent), as far as I know nobody’s ever seen it going out of
existence and it seems to have been here forever, it’s not really divisible,
and so on, and so forth. That would leave only the question of whether it’s

"as “the quantum fluctuation of spacetime.” In that case, spacetime itself
could be considered the fundamental Being on which everything else depends,
which has existential inertia. This is what Richard Carrier brought up in his
review of Five Proofs. Yes, yes, as Feser said, ” Space-time, for all Carrier
has shown, is contingent. Accordingly, its essence is distinct from its
existence, it is by itself merely potential unless actualized, and thus it
requires a cause distinct from it. Since it is extended, it is also in the
relevant sense material (contrary to what Carrier asserts) and is composite
rather than simple (contrary to what Carrier asserts),” but Carrier (and I)
would contest all that and argue that properly conceived, spacetime is purely
actual in the metaphysical sense required for an atheistic sort of pantheism

article](https://philpapers.org/archive/SCHEIA-20.pdf). I will respond to his

4](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-part-4/). This post is Part 5, which deals with everything
Feser says on the metaphysics of existential inertia. There are only two more
installments of the series left: Part 6, which deals with everything Feser
says in his section “Theoretical vices”, and Part 7, which addresses
everything Feser says in his section ‘An argument against EIT’.",1010
"Feser writes: “Schmid next considers two possible ways of spelling out EIT.
The first account goes like this: Consider the water in our earlier example.
Its existence at some time _t_ is sufficiently explained by (a) the state and
existence of the water at an immediately preceding time _t_ – 1 together with
(b) the absence of anything acting to destroy the water.”",366
"This first account of EIT is another aspect of the paper I would modify. When
I wrote the paper, I wanted to leave this first account open between (what I
have more recently termed) ‘[transtemporal
accounts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_r4u8vkQ_4D6HwKL-
Mkn20ieJ_i_e13O/view?usp=sharing)’ and ‘[no-change
accounts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VJylrJ-8olSgbUUf6m0FOeSP-
RrrJJO_/view?usp=sharing)’ (cf. those links for more detailed
characterization). Both of these accounts cite at least one fact about past
things to explain the present existence of the water. Naturally, then, I
thought they could both fall under my first account in the IJPR paper, since
they both — at least under one way to articulate them — appeal to the moment
immediately before the present moment as part of the explanation of the
present existence of an object. But I have now come to see that this was a
mistake, since transtemporal and no-change accounts of EIT — while unified by
such an appeal — are nevertheless fundamentally different kinds of
explanations. The result is that my IJPR’s first account can be read in either
transtemporal-account terms or no-change-account terms, and this makes things
difficult (as all ambiguities do). So, let me tease out these two different
ways of understanding the first IJPR account.",1314
"On a transtemporal understanding of the first IJPR account, some kind of
transtemporal relation(s) to explain persistence. In the paper, I leave open
the precise nature of the relevant transtemporal explanatory relation,
allowing the relation to be either causal or non-causal. According to this
understanding of the first IJPR account, then, temporal concrete object S’s
persistence is explained by (i) the absence of sufficiently causally
destructive factors operative on S, plus (ii) transtemporal explanatory
relations (causal or otherwise) obtaining between the temporally successive
states of S’s life (so to speak).",622
"Now, for the sake of concreteness, let’s stipulate that the relation at play
is causation. Moreover — again for the sake of concreteness — let’s stipulate
that time is discrete and so composed of smallest units. Let’s call these
smallest units of time _moments_. Thus, a transtemporal understanding of the
first IJPR account says that S’s existence at moment m is explained by (i) the
absence of sufficiently causally destructive factors operative on S from (m-1)
to m [where (m-1) is the moment immediately prior to m], plus (ii) S’s state
and/or existence at (m-1) causally producing S’s existence at m (and perhaps
state at m). An explanation for S’s persistence _simpliciter_ through a series
of moments will come by way of the application of this explanatory schema to
each non-first moment m of S’s existence in the series of moments.",840
"That, then, is the transtemporal understanding of the first IJPR account that
we’ll work with. Now let’s consider the no-change understanding of the first
IJPR account.",168
"In general, no-change accounts of EIT view persistence as an absence of change
and take this fact to be central to their inertialist-friendly explanation of
persistence. The no-change account we’ll consider here is one I’ve mentioned
both in this series of responses to Feser and in Section 3 of my [lengthier
response to Feser](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-
schmid-on-the-aristotelian-proof/). Here’s how it goes.",443
"For S to **fail** to exist at m despite existing at (m-1) is for some
**change** to occur.[Fn] But a change occurs only if some factor causally
induces said change. Hence, if no factor causally induces a change, then the
change won’t occur. Thus, if no factor causally induces S to fail to exist at
m despite existing at (m-1), then S exists at m. Once we add that nothing came
along to causally induce this — that is, once we add that nothing came along
to destroy S from (m-1) to m — it simply follows that S exists at m. [Cf.
Section 4.1 in the[ lengthier blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/) for those interested in pursuing this line of thought
even further.]",732
"Here, we seem to have a perfectly respectable, perfectly legitimate
explanation of S’s existence at m — and the explanation does, indeed, tell us
how S exists at m. That was a straightforward deduction of the explanatory
facts cited [namely, (i) S existed immediately before m [to wit, at (m-1)],
(ii) nothing causally induced S’s cessation at (m-1) or m [i.e., nothing
destroyed S from the immediately prior moment, (m-1), through m], and (iii) a
change occurs only if some factor causally induces said change]. And so we do,
indeed, have sufficient explanation for S’s existence at m. For me at least,
the explanation certainly seems to remove mystery as to why/how S exists at m.
The present explanation **does** , indeed, tell us how S exists at m.",752
"[Fn] I addressed an objection to this argument [or, rather, _explanatory
schema_ ] based on the claim that cessation isn’t a change in [Section 4.1.2
of my lengthier blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-

search “4.1.2”.",340
"To be sure, the disambiguation above — that between transtemporal and no-
change understandings of the first IJPR account — is not found in the IJPR
article. That’s why I said, at the beginning, that this is an aspect of the
IJPR paper I would _modify_. Of course, Feser is not responsible (and nor will
I take him to be, as we proceed in this post) for ignoring this
disambiguation. But given that this disambiguation represents my current,
actual views on the IJPR paper, I will proceed in my analysis of what Feser
says with the disambiguation in mind. (It would be unreasonable, of course,
for one to demand that I defend the non-disambiguated-version from the IJPR
paper if I _disagree_ with its being non-disambiguated in the manner it was!)",747
"Let’s pick back up, then, with what Feser says: “Now, an objection that might
be raised against existential inertia thus understood (and one I have raised
in my exchanges with Graham Oppy and in my previous reply to Schmid) is that
it is viciously circular. Existential inertia would be a property or power of
the water. So, the water’s persistence from _t_ – 1 to _t_ would, on this
account, depend on this property or power. But properties and powers depend
for their reality on the substances that possess them. So, we seem to have a
situation where the water’s persistence depends on that of a property or power
which in turn depends on the persistence of the water.”",671
"I have responded to this circularity objection in Section 3 of my [lengthier
blog post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-
on-the-aristotelian-proof/), but I will also address it here.",215
"First, neither my transtemporal understanding nor my no-change understanding
of the first IJPR account entail that inertial persistence is a property or
power. Both of the accounts could, for instance, be perfectly acceptable to
philosophers of an anti-realist bent who think there are no such things as
properties or powers. There is simply nothing in the articulations above that
entail EI’s being a property or power.",420
"Second, in order for Feser’s circularity argument to work, the two
articulations must cite explanatory facts that presuppose the (explanatorily
or ontologically) prior obtaining the relevant explanandum. But that is simply
untrue, as I will now show.",250
"In the case of the transtemporal understanding of the first IJPR account, we
have:",82
"**Explanans 1** : (i) there is an absence of sufficiently causally destructive
factors operative on S from (m-1) to m [where (m-1) is the moment immediately
prior to m], and (ii) the state and/or existence of temporal concrete objects
(or, at least, those within EIT’s quantificational domain) at a given moment
(m-1) at which they exist causally produce their existence at the next moment,
m, provided that no sufficiently causally _destructive_ factors are operative.",469
"In the case of the no-change understanding of the first IJPR account, we have:",78
"**Explanans 2** : (i) S existed immediately before m — that is, at (m-1) —
(ii) if S existed immediately before m but fails to exist at m, then S’s
cessation is (or involves, or entails) some kind of change, (iii) nothing
causally induces S’s cessation at (m-1) or m — that is, nothing destroyed S
from the immediately prior moment, (m-1), through m — and (iv) a change occurs
only if some factor causally induces said change.",426
"Now, I think it’s quite clear that neither Explanans 1 nor Explanans 2
presuppose the prior reality or obtaining of Explanandum. In other words, none
of the explanatory facts adduced in Explanans 1 or Explanans 2 are dependent
upon the fact cited in the Explanandum. And in that case, Feser’s allegation
of viciously circular (explanatory) dependence has no teeth against the
transtemporal and no-change understandings of the first IJPR account. It is
simply false, of both of these understandings, that there is some property or
power that both _explains_ and is explained _by_ some fact.",589
"[Keep in mind, moreover, that there are many more inertialist-friendly
explanations besides, and that these, too, do not fall prey to charges of
vicious circularity. Cf. the various documents I linked in Section 2.2 of my
[lengthier blog post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-
on-schmid-on-the-aristotelian-proof/).]",339
"So far I’ve offered two responses to the vicious circularity charge. First,
neither of the understandings of the first IJPR account treat (or entail that)
inertial persistence is a property or power. Second, the explanations
proffered in neither of the understandings are viciously circular. Here’s a
third response to the vicious circularity charge. Suppose — contrary to what I
believe — that existential inertia were a property. This would only be
problematic if we accepted the controversial thesis that properties ground
character — that is, it is in virtue of possessing/exemplifying/instantiating
(say) the property _redness_ that something is red. But suppose we reject this
thesis and adopt its opposite: it is rather in virtue of being red that
something possesses/etc. the property _redness_. Under this anti-character-
grounding view, it is simply false — _pace_ Feser — that existential inertia’s
being a property entails that the water exists at m [or persists from (m-1) to
m] because it has the property of existential inertia. Rather, the substance
has the property of existential inertia because it exists at m [or persists
from (m-1) to m] in an inertial fashion. So _even if_ existential inertia were
a property [it’s not], Feser’s argument still won’t work.",1278
"One of my friends [Luiz] suggested to me a fourth response to Feser’s
argument. Luiz argues that it is _false_ that all properties of a substance
inhere in the substance and have an asymmetric dependence relation to the
substance. And in that case, one of Feser’s key claims — that properties
depend for their reality on the substances that possess them — is false. (Or,
at least, I assume Feser is saying that this applies to _all_ properties. For
if it only applies to _some_ properties, then his argument would be invalid
[this is invalid: (1) EI is a property; (2) _some_ properties depend on
substances [i.e., the substances that have them]; (3) Therefore, EI depends on
substances.)",688
"Luiz gives examples of properties of substances that don’t depend thereon.
(Or, at least, examples that would be kosher by the lights of our
Aristotelian-Thomistic friends.) These include what Aristotle calls secondary
substances (species, genera) and specific differences (essential properties)
as well as transcendental properties (being, unity, goodness, truth) which
cannot depend upon the substance that possesses them in the same asymmetric
way an accident is.",466
"In any case, I’m still reflecting on Luiz’s argument as a fourth response. I
offer it here because I see value in it and because you might too.",143
"Feser: “Schmid considers something like this “circularity” objection (though
his exposition of it seems to me to be quite murky, so it is possible that he
has something else in mind). In response to it, he says that if the objection
had any force, it would have force against _any_ account of the persistence of
the water, including an account that attributes its persistence to God. For if
we suppose that God causes the water to persist from _t_ – 1 to _t_ , then we
will be _presupposing_ that it is possible for it to persist from _t_ – 1 to
_t_ , and thus won’t be giving a non-circular _explanation_ of how it is
possible for it to do so. And if the theist replies that God gives the water
the ability to persist, then this will only push the problem back a stage
insofar as it will presuppose that God has the ability to do so.”",835
"I find this to be a very odd response, and I confess that I’m not sure I even
understand what Schmid is going on about. The circularity objection has
nothing do with presupposing that it is possible for something to persist, or
with presupposing that things have abilities, or anything like whatever Schmid
is talking about. Rather, it has to do with the fact that properties and
powers are ontologically dependent on substances, so that substances cannot
without circularity be said to be ontologically dependent on properties or
powers.",538
"Again, perhaps that is _not_ the objection Schmid is talking about. But if it
isn’t, then I’m not sure what he _is_ talking about. Certainly he doesn’t seem
to be talking about (a) an objection that any critic of EIT has actually
given, or (b) an objection that is interesting.”",278
"Oddly, Feser says “Certainly [Schmid] doesn’t seem to be talking about (a) an
objection that any critic of EIT has actually given, or (b) an objection that
is interesting.”",172
"First, I never claimed any critic of EIT has given this in the literature. But
I **did** receive _precisely this objection_ from those critical of the
account in question. (I wrote the paper years ago, and so I don’t remember who
precisely raised the objection to me. In all probability, it was an anonymous
referee.) And Feser’s finding it uninteresting is itself uninteresting and
irrelevant, since it was an objection I received and needed to deal with.",456
"Moreover, I don’t find the objection I was considering in the paper murky at
all, and nor did the reviewers of the paper or other philosophers [e.g. Josh
Rasmussen] I’ve discussed it with. But I guess I can try to explain it in a
clearer way here for Feser and those who find it murky.",285
"For starters, the objection I was considering is _not_ the circularity
objection Feser raises in the blog post and to which I responded above, and so
it is irrelevant for Feser to point out that the objection I was considering
‘has nothing do’ with his objection. The correct response is ‘And? I wasn’t
addressing your objection here.’",335
"To get a better sense of the objection, let’s have a look at the paper:",71
"The objection is that the explanans [the immediately temporally prior state
and existence of O plus nothing intervening between that prior moment and the
present moment] cannot _explain_ the present existence of O ( _pace_ the
account) — that is, it cannot _explain_ the persistence of O from that
immediately prior moment to the present moment — since it merely presupposes
that O has the ability to persist from that prior state to the present state.
But surely it was precisely this ability to persist that was trying to be
explained!",537
"My response was that it is **not** ( _pace_ the objection) the _ability_ of O
to persist that was trying to be explained. Rather, it is _O’s actually
persisting_ that is trying to be explained. So my response was that the
objection under consideration mischaracterizes the explanandum. I then went on
to circumvent an objection that was next leveled to me [after making the above
response]: but doesn’t O’s _actually_ persisting _itself_ presuppose O’s
_ability_ to persist, i.e., the _possibility_ that O persists? To circumvent
this, I pointed out that _any_ explanation of persistence will, of course,
presuppose the _possibility_ that O persists — after all, if it’s impossible
that O persist, then clearly there won’t be any true explanation of O’s
persistence. So yes, my account does presuppose the possibility that O
persists, but this is not a problem for the account. What matters is whether
or not the account presupposes the _actual_ persistence of O. And I proceeded
to point out that it _doesn’t_ ; instead, it provides a _means by which_ such
actual persistence is secured.",1088
"I don’t see anything murky here. It’s a perfectly natural dialectic, with a
clear objection and rejoinder, responding to a natural-but-ultimately-
misguided objection I had received.",182
"Feser: “Anyway, Schmid goes on to discuss a further possible objection to this
first way of spelling out EIT, one grounded in a presentist theory of time.
The objection would be that what happens at _t_ – 1 cannot explain what
happens at the present moment t, because (according to presentism) past
moments like _t_ – 1 no longer exist, and what does not exist cannot be the
explanation of anything. Schmid responds to this possible objection by setting
out several arguments in defense of the claim that past events can play a role
in explaining present ones.",560
"Schmid does not attribute this objection to anyone, and as he rightly notes,
presentists in fact do _not_ in general claim in the first place that past
events play no role in explaining the present. So what is the point of
devoting several pages to an argument no presentist has given or is likely to
give? I’m not sure, and I don’t myself have anything to add to what Schmid
says in response to it.”",400
"It’s not hard to think of an obvious purpose that justifies its inclusion:
_maybe I received the objection from someone critical of the account_. And
that is precisely what happened. (Once more, I don’t remember who it was, as
this all happened years ago. But once more, in all probability, it was an
anonymous referee.)",320
"Feser: “Certainly the fact that the past is relevant to explaining the present
gives (contrary to what Schmid seems to think) no support to EIT.”",145
"This is odd. To my knowledge, nowhere do I claim in the article that the
explanatory efficacy of past things _supports_ EIT. My goal in sketching the
account, there, is to point out that _one metaphysical account_ of EIT says
that past things _are_ sufficient to explain present things. I wasn’t trying
to _support_ [i.e., positively justify] the account in talking about the
explanatory efficacy of past things. Rather, I was first and foremost
responding to an objection I had received that denied this, and secondly I was
using it to set up my **_undercutting_** defeater for premise (7) of the
Aristotelian proof.",617
"‘All I need to do is point out that _nothing in premise (7) or that which is
said on its behalf_ gives those who **do** think past things suffice to
explain present things sufficient reason to _abandon_ their position. I do not
need to _positively justify_ why past things **do** suffice to explain present
things. I need only point out that nothing said in premise (7) or on its
behalf gives those who accept the explanatory sufficiency of past things
adequate reason to abandon their position. And here’s something that seems to
bolster this undercutting defeater: we know that past things can and do
legitimately explain, at least in part, present things. Given this, why should
someone who thinks this **suffices** be moved to postulate something _in
addition_?’",766
What I write about this in the article is as follows:,53
"In fairness to those who think <Joe claims that the arguments Joe gives
_positively justify or support_ the thesis that past things _suffice_ to
explain present things>, in the passage above I did not distinguish between
‘sufficiently explain’ and ‘explain at least in part’, and I certainly
**should** have. For I am intending here to point out that past things can and
do legitimately explain, _at least in part_ , present things. For purposes of
clarity, I should have included this. But it is still true that I reference,
in the sentence, ‘the above arguments’. And so my conclusion here — a
conclusion of those arguments — is supposed to be drawn precisely from those
arguments. And as we inspect the arguments, it is clear that I mean that past
things can and do explain, at least in (large) part, present things. E.g., I
say therein that “although our _experience_ of an object temporally lags
behind the object itself, the object itself nevertheless _explains_ our
experience. And this, in turn, entails that earlier states explain later
states.” But here I clearly don’t mean that the object _sufficiently_ explains
our experience. A _sufficient_ explanation of my experience also clearly needs
to cite a functioning visual and neurophysiological apparatus, and so on.",1277
"Feser: “For what is at issue in the debate over EIT and EET is not whether
what happens at _t_ – 1 is _part of_ the explanation of what is true of the
water at _t_ , but rather whether it is by itself _sufficient_ to explain what
is true of it at _t_.”",252
"It is true that this is part of what’s at issue in the debate over EIT and
EET, but we also have to be clear about the burden of proof in the present
dialectical context. In particular, we must remember that in the dialectical
context of the IJPR paper [namely, the Aristotelian proof and whether one can
“sufficiently **undercut** the argument” (p. 203 of my paper, emphasis added)
by showing that its rejection of EIT “is not adequately justified” (ibid.)],
**Feser** is the one offering a _positive argument_ one of whose premises
requires that what happened prior to t is **not** sufficient to explain the
water’s existence at t. By contrast, in spelling out my first account of EIT
and in leveling my overarching EIT-based **undercutting** defeater of premise
(7), I do **not** take a stance on whether or not what happened prior to t is
by itself sufficient to explain the water’s existence at t. [Yes, _according
to the first account_ , it **is** sufficient to explain it. But I don’t
positively claim, in the article, that the first account is true. I sketched
it to facilitate the overarching EIT-based undercutting defeater of the
Aristotelian proof.] Rather, my aim is to point out that nothing in premise
(7) or what Feser says on its behalf gives those who **do** think ‘what
happened prior to t is sufficient to explain the water’s existence at t’ —
that is, those who **do** accept the first IJPR account — sufficient reason to
_abandon_ their view. The onus is thus not on _me_ to give _positive reasons_
for thinking what happened prior to t _is_ sufficient to explain the water’s
existence at t. Rather, all I need to do is point out that (i) in order for
Feser’s proof to succeed, he needs to positively show that what happened prior
to t is _not_ sufficient for the water to exist at t, and that (ii) he has not
succeeded in showing this. And so we must keep in mind that it is no mark
against my paper or my case that I don’t positively justify the first IJPR
account, i.e., that I don’t positively justify that past things **do** suffice
to explain the present existence of something.",2106
"[Fn] To be sure, I **do** go on to mount some reasons favoring EIT in the
theoretical virtues section of the paper. But this is simply meant to bolster
and strengthen my EIT-based undercutting defeater. I had already explained the
undercutting nature of my overall thesis in the stage-setting bit of my paper
[e.g., I was seeking to “sufficiently **undercut** the argument” (p. 20e,
emphasis added) by arguing that its rejection of EIT “is not adequately
justified” (ibid.).",474
"In short, I want us all to keep in mind the dialectical context: detractors of
the Aristotelian proof **don’t need** to _positively justify or establish_
that what happened prior to t **is** sufficient to explain the water’s
existence at t. They only need to point out that the **Aristotelian proof**
fails to justify why they **aren’t** sufficient.",349
"I have argued in this blog post, Section 3 of my [lengthier blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/), and [Part
2](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/06/feser-on-schmid-on-
existential-inertia-part-2/) that at least with the no-change understanding of
the first IJPR account, the explanatory facts adduced **are** , indeed,
**sufficient**. Indeed, if by ‘sufficient explanation’ we mean an explanation
citing facts that remove mystery as to why the explanandum obtains, then I
confess that — by my lights — the no-change understanding certainly removes
mystery [for me, at least] as to why and how S exists at m. The explanandum
was simply derived from the explanatory facts cited, and to me at least, they
illuminate precisely why S exists at m. And I also confess that the same is
true [again, by my lights] with the transtemporal understanding of the first
IJPR account. By examining Explanans 1 from earlier, once more S’s existence
at m is simply derived from the explanatory facts adduced. And those facts
certainly do seem, to me, to remove mystery as to why S exists at m.",1155
"To be sure, there might be the further question about why some of those
explanatory facts _themselves_ obtain. For instance, there might be the
question as to why reality is so constituted that the successive stages in an
object’s life are related by causal relations. But this is a _separate
question_ from why S exists at m. And, plausibly, it won’t be all that
difficult to provide plausible stories for the former question. [Indeed, it’s
not clear why explaining it would be any more difficult than explaining why
reality is so constituted so as to have any causal relations at all (ever), or
is so constituted so as to have causal relations other than those relating the
successive stages of an object’s life, or what have you.] Finally, to quote
Beaudoin, “it is not a condition on legitimate explanation that a deeper
explanation for every statement in the explanans always be ready to hand, or
even that it exist at all” (2007, p. 89).",943
"Feser: “(I have to say that I wonder what kind of rhetorical effect this kind
of stuff has on Schmid’s readers, some of whom – judging from my combox – seem
very impressed by it. Schmid’s discussion of this first interpretation of EIT
occupies almost five pages of analysis, with the standard bells and whistles
that we analytic philosophers pick up in grad school and from reading academic
journal articles – semi-formal formulations, the entertaining of various
hypotheticals, and so on. Other things Schmid has written, such as the article
addressed in my previous post on Schmid, have a similar character. Untutored
readers, especially those whose knowledge of philosophy is largely drawn from
blog posts, Reddit discussions, and the like, are bound to think: “Wow, this
is so technical and rigorous!” Yet in fact the analysis is sometimes not
terribly clear, and in this case it is devoted to criticizing claims that _no
critic of EIT has actually made or is likely to make in the first place!_ So
it seems to me that some of the rigor is specious.)”",1055
"I have already addressed the allegation that the analysis is not terribly
clear. To be sure, I can’t stop Feser from finding it murky. But I can at
least report that neither I myself, nor the referees of the paper, nor
philosophers and other colleagues I’ve conversed with about the matter, found
it murky. I have also already addressed Feser’s claim that “no critic of EIT
has actually made” these criticisms “or is likely to make [them] in the first
place”. Apparently addressing actual criticisms I received [in all
probability, from reviewers] hasn’t crossed Feser’s mind as a plausible
explanation of why it’s included. And so I take his allegations here to be
specious.",675
"Feser: “Schmid considers a second possible account of EIT, according to which
existential inertia is simply a basic or primitive feature of reality. He
suggests that one way of reading this claim, in turn, is that it is a
_necessary_ feature of reality that things have existential inertia. But there
are two obvious problems with this. The first is that there is no reason to
believe it. (I’ll come back to that.)”",415
"But there are many obvious problems with Feser’s response here. First, the
purpose of spelling out the metaphysical accounts of EIT is _not_ to provide
positive reasons for accepting them. Rather, the purpose is to _flesh out_ the
inertial thesis, to pinpoint that _in virtue of which_ it is true _if it is
true at all_.",320
"Second, in the present dialectical context, I do _not_ need to give _positive
reasons_ to believe this account of EIT. Once again — and this is a point I
made repeatedly in Section 3 of my [lengthier blog
post](https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/2021/07/04/feser-on-schmid-on-the-
aristotelian-proof/) — in the present dialectical context of Feser’s
Aristotelian proof, the onus is **not** on _detractors_ to **positively
justify** this account of EIT. They need only point out that (i) nothing in
premise (7) or that which Feser says on its behalf adequately justify
**denying** the account, and that (ii) justifying such a denial is precisely
what would **need** to be done for the proof to work. In other words, the
account need only be proffered as an **undercutting** defeater, and one need
only point out that nothing that Feser says in his chapter gives those who
**do** accept the account sufficient reason to abandon their position.",944
"Third, it’s false that ‘there is no reason to believe it’. You may not _agree_
with the following line of reasoning, but it’s obvious that it at least
represents a reason to believe this account of EIT: Suppose we have reason to
think presentism is true. Suppose we have reason to think that if presentism
is true, then the facts or truths [about temporal realities, like ‘dinosaurs
exist’] change. Suppose we have reason to think that if the facts or truths
themselves change, then any omniscient being’s knowledge likewise changes
[since knowledge is factive, and hence if the facts or truths _themselves_
change, the knowledge couldn’t remain _unchanged_ ]. Suppose we think that if
a being’s knowledge changes, it’s not timeless. Then we have reason to think
that any omniscient being isn’t timeless. Suppose, then, that we have reason
to think that if there is a timeless sustaining cause of temporal things, then
this timeless sustaining cause would be an omniscient God. Since we have
reason to think that no omniscient being is timeless, we thereby have reason
to think that there is no timeless sustaining cause of temporal things. We
thereby have reason to think that at least some temporal things [debarring
infinitely descending chains of per se causal dependence] persist in the
absence of sustenance from without. We thereby have reason to think (a version
of) EIT is true. And as I argued in the stage-setting portion of my IJPR
paper, EET or EIT would be necessarily true if true at all. So we have reason
to think EIT is necessarily true. This alone could justifiably raise one’s
credence in the present account of EIT and thereby constitute some reason to
accept it.",1684
"To be sure, I’m not here claiming that the above argument succeeds in
demonstrating EIT or the second IJPR account under consideration. I’m simply
pointing out that it’s just false — _pace_ Feser — to say that ‘there is no
reason’ to accept the account in question. Even if you don’t think the reason
is adequate, or don’t think some step in the line of argument works, to say
there is _no reason here at all_ just strikes me as obviously wrong.",445
"For these three reasons, Feser’s first “obvious” problem for the second IJPR
account ‘obviously’ fails.",103
"Before turning to what Feser says next, I once more want to flag that the
second IJPR account is another element of the IJPR paper I would slightly
modify if I could. In particular, I think it needs some clarification about
what, precisely — if anything — is doing the explanatory heavy-lifting here.",300
"In subsequent work, I’ve come to call this account a ‘propositional necessity
account’ of EIT, and I wish to add greater clarity to the account from the
IJPR paper. Henceforth, I’ll call this the propositional necessity
understanding of the second IJPR account. To be sure, not everything I’m about
to say is found in the IJPR article. That’s why I said that this is an aspect
of the IJPR paper I would _modify_. Of course, Feser is not responsible (and
nor will I take him to be, as we proceed in this post) for ignoring these
clarifications. But given that such clarifications represent my current,
actual views on the IJPR paper, I will proceed in my analysis of what Feser
says with the clarification in mind.",713
"_Propositional necessity accounts_ explain the truth of EIT in terms of its
_necessary_ truth. Such accounts therefore adduce the necessary truth of the
_proposition_ reporting EIT as an explanation of the proposition’s truth. Why
does O (for each O within EIT’s quantificational domain) persist, according to
such accounts? Simply because (i) _it is a metaphysically necessary truth_
that, if O exists, O persists unless and until positively destroyed, and (ii)
O has not (yet) been subjected to sufficiently destructive factors.",530
"According to this propositional necessity understanding of the second IJPR
account, inertial persistence is “a basic, primitive, foundational feature of
reality”, by which the paper means that it neither analyzes into nor
“obtain[s] in virtue of more fundamental/basic facts” (2021, p. 209). By
‘necessary feature of reality’, it is clear from context that the IJPR paper
means that _EIT itself_ —that is, the existential inertia _thesis_ —is simply
a metaphysically necessary truth.[1] The _truth_ of EIT, then, is explained by
the _metaphysical necessity_ thereof; and its metaphysical necessity is not
explained in terms of any more basic or fundamental truths.",664
"Does this account accrue a theoretical cost by ending in a primitive or
unexplained necessity? It’s not clear that it does. The proposition for which
we seek an explanation is that temporal concrete objects persist. Let this
proposition be _p_. Now, the chain of explanations of _p_ is either finite or
infinite. If it’s infinite, then it’s unclear that we actually have an
adequate explanation of _p_ , after all. If _p_ obtains in virtue of _q 1_,
and _q 1_ obtains in virtue of _q 2_, and so on _ad infinitum_ , arguably we
have simply infinitely _deferred_ an adequate explanation of _p_. This kind of
infinite dependence regress, in many philosophers’ eyes, is vicious. So
suppose that the chain of explanations of _p_ is finite. In that case, the
chain ends in something that is _not further explained_ —that is, it ends in
something primitive.[2] In that case, though, it is surely no mark against the
propositional necessity understanding of the second IJPR account that _it_ ,
too, ends in something primitive, since _every_ explanation of _p_ —if the
aforementioned reasoning holds—must likewise end in something primitive.[3]",1136
"But perhaps someone will object that this propositional necessity account
stops the explanatory buck too early. For there are _further explanations
available_ —ones that are viable and illuminating. All else being equal, if we
have a viable, readily-available, illuminating explanation for _x_ , then we
shouldn’t adopt a view on which _x_ is simply brute. We should, instead,
explain things as far as we can. Schmid’s propositional necessity account
violates this. It explains persistence ultimately by appeal to metaphysical
necessity, which in turn is taken to be a brute or primitive necessity. But
there is a viable, readily-available, illuminating explanation of persistence
in terms of the sustaining activity of something timeless. Yes, this
explanation will eventually bottom out in some primitive metaphysical
necessity; but _unlike_ Schmid’s account, it doesn’t fall afoul of stopping
the explanatory buck too early.",927
"I have two responses. First, even if the alternative account adducing timeless
sustenance has an explanatory advantage over the propositional necessity
account, the latter is far more _parsimonious_ than the former in terms of
both quantitative simplicity (the number of entities postulated) and
qualitative simplicity (the number of irreducible _kinds_ of entities
postulated). For the former posits not only more _entities_ (namely, timeless
concreta in addition to temporal concreta, as well as relations obtaining
between the two) but also more _kinds_ of entities (namely, the new category
of _timeless concreta_ ). Thus, even _granting_ an explanatory advantage to
the timeless sustenance view, it’s not at all clear that it is superior to the
propositional necessity account _all things considered_.",806
"Second, it’s not at all clear that the timeless sustenance view enjoys an
explanatory advantage. For it only seems to _multiply_ rather than _reduce_
mystery. What, for instance, does the timeless-to-temporal explanatory
relation consist in? How can something timeless cause (or ground, or realize,
or whatever) temporal things? If a dynamic view of time is correct, wouldn’t
the timeless cause change at least in its relational properties, thereby
entailing _succession_ in its life (and, hence, temporality)?[4] Moreover, why
does the timeless cause seem to make a concerted effort to ensure that objects
only cease to exist once they are positively destroyed? This harkens back to
an observation made in Oderberg (2014): we witness things ceasing to exist
_when and only when_ they are subjected to destructive forces. But this seems
wholly mysterious if there is an altogether separate way for such objects to
cease to exist (namely, a withdrawal of timeless sustaining activity). If the
timeless sustainer genuinely _could_ remove its sustaining activity at any
moment of an object’s life, it becomes a mystery why this _never_ seems to
occur for objects ( _except_ when and only when the objects are subject to
destructive forces—but even in these cases, it is surely the _destructive
factors_ , not the withdrawal of timeless sustenance, that explain the
object’s cessation).[5] (I note that this problem is compounded even further
for **classical** theism, since absolutely nothing about God himself varies
across worlds in which he timelessly sustains O from t* to t (t* < t) versus
worlds in which God withdraws his timeless sustenance at any point between t*
and t — in which case, we cannot point to any fact about God that varies or
differs across such worlds to account for why, in one world, O persists from
t* to t as opposed to being annihilated at some point therebetween. (Is
‘therebetween’ a word? IT IS NOW!!!!) And I add, moreover, that there are
many, many more worlds of the latter kind than the former, given how many
moments there are in the typical object’s life.]",2091
"Obviously, none of the aforementioned questions amount to _objections_. My
purpose in posing them is to illustrate that the timeless sustenance account
seems merely to _raise_ more questions than it answers. It only seems to
_multiply_ rather than _reduce_ mystery when it comes to explaining
persistence. _This_ is why I say it’s not at all clear that the timeless
sustenance account enjoys an explanatory advantage over my propositional
necessity account.",457
"[1] The paper describes the account, for instance, as one according to which
EIT is “a primitive necessity” (2021, p. 210). The account is thus clearly a
_propositional_ necessity account.",188
"[2] One might think that the terminus of the chain of explanations—while not
explained by any _further_ proposition—is nevertheless _self-explanatory_. I
have two responses. First, I find it plausible that nothing can explain or
account for why it _itself_ is true (or obtains, or exists) at all. For in
order to have any explanatory power in the first place, it would ‘already’ (as
it were) have to be true (obtain, exist). (‘Already’ expresses not temporal
but ontological priority.) Plausibly, one cannot merely _presuppose_ the very
thing for which one sought illumination. (Also, just imagine: if we ask why
_q_ is true, it’s no use responding ‘because _q_ is true’. Surely, I say, this
explains nothing!) But suppose I’m wrong about the impossibility of self-
explanation. Suppose, in other words, that some propositions can explain their
own truth. Presumably, this will involve the proposition having a kind of
‘intrinsic intelligibility’—once the proposition is grasped, there is no
mystery concerning why it is true. This brings us to my second response:
plausibly, _no_ explanation of persistence will be self-explanatory—in which
case, each explanation of persistence will end in an unexplained primitive.
And in that case, the fact that my propositional necessity account ends in an
unexplained primitive is not a mark against it as an explanation of
persistence. Consider explanations of persistence that deny EIT. Such
explanations either adduce one or more _atemporal_ concrete objects that
sustain temporal objects or else an infinitely descending chain of more
fundamental temporal concrete objects sustaining or conserving less
fundamental temporal concrete objects (of which the former aren’t parts). But
surely neither the proposition <there is such an atemporal concrete object>
nor <there is such an infinitely descending chain> are self-explanatory.",1873
"[3] We could go further: this primitive is either contingent or necessary. But
contingent propositions—precisely because they _genuinely could have been
false_ —seem to call out for further explanations of why they are true. (Cf.
Pruss (2006) for an extended defense of the thesis that every contingent
proposition has an explanation.) Plausibly, then, the primitive must be
_necessary_. But then _any_ explanation of _p_ terminates in a primitive
necessity, and so surely it’s no mark against my propositional necessity
account that its explanation of _p_ terminates in a primitive necessity.",593
"[4] For example, assuming that _x_ is causally sustained by the timeless
cause, the timeless cause will arguably _acquire_ a relational (causal)
property once _x_ begins to exist and lose a relational (causal) property once
_x_ ceases to exist. To be sure, such changes need not be _intrinsic_ to the
timeless thing. There are plenty of cases where a subject gains or loses some
_relational_ property without undergoing _intrinsic_ change. (A father might
become shorter than his son solely because _his son has grown_.) But even in
such cases, the subject of the extrinsically relational change is _temporal_ ,
since it can only gain or lose the relational property if there are distinct
moments _m_ and _m*_ of its life at which the relational property is had and
then lacked (or vice versa). Much, much more can be said here on both sides of
the issue, but this suffices for a footnote.",889
"[5] One might say that the timeless sustainer is _necessitated_ to engage in
such sustaining activity. But why would that be? Is this just a brute or
primitive necessity? Going this route will similarly multiply mysteries, it
seems. (Detractors of EIT of a _theist_ stripe will likely resist this
response, too, as it seems to remove the timeless God’s _freedom_.)",364
"Feser: “The second is that there is positive reason to _dis_ believe it.
Again, with lions, Tyrannosauruses, water, etc., there is simply nothing about
their natures or essences that entails that they exist _at all_. So how could
it be just a _basic and necessary_ feature of a world comprised of such things
that they _persist_ in existence?”",343
"There isn’t much I can evaluate here, since Feser just asks a question and, in
doing so, perhaps supposes that his audience shares his intuition that the
following conditional claim is true:",190
"CONDITIONAL: If O’s _existing at all_ is not a basic and necessary fact, then
O’s _persisting (once in existence)_ is not a basic and necessary fact.",149
"I don’t find CONDITIONAL _implausible_ , but I also don’t quite find it
_plausible_. Someone who accepts the propositional necessity account will
presumably just say: ‘CONDITIONAL amounts to a mere denial of my view. Why,
then, should I _accept_ it?’.",251
"Feser next says: “Schmid also suggests that the thesis that it is a necessary
feature of reality that lions, water, etc. have existential inertia is no less
plausible a terminus of explanation than the thesis that God, qua pure
actuality, exists of necessity. Both theses, he claims, posit something
“primitive,” but EIT is more parsimonious.”",343
"I do suggest this in the paper, but I would modify the second IJPR account to
include the clarifications above about what, precisely, is doing the
explanatory heavy-lifting and how, precisely, the account compares with a
rival timeless sustenance account. Next Feser says:",272
"“But this is quite absurd. As I argue in _Five Proofs_ and in my article on
existential inertia (both of which Schmid purports to be responding to in the
present article), the _reason_ contingent things are contingent is that they
are composed of parts, and in particular that they have potentialities as well
as actualities.”",326
"But it is quite absurd to say that the reason contingent things are contingent
is that they are composed of parts, and in particular that they have
potentialities and actualities. Consider the number two. The number two has
various properties, such as the property of being even. But anything with
various properties is a composite thing, by the lights of those who accept a
broadly classical theistic understanding of parthood. (This is one reason they
deny that God has a multiplicity of properties — that would, by their lights,
entail that God has parts, whereas God is simple.) So the number two is a
composite thing. But the number two is not a contingent thing. It’s not like
the number two just happens to exist in some worlds and not others. So surely
the reason why something is contingent is **not** that it is composed of
parts. Or consider a view of God on which God is timeless, immutable,
impassible, necessarily existent, but nevertheless has some potential for
cross-world variance [say, God has potential to have timelessly performed an
act of creation that is numerically distinct from his actual act of creation,
or God has potential to have different intrinsic knowledge states (timelessly)
across worlds, or whatever). It is obvious that nothing about God (so
construed) having some potential for cross-world variance compromises God’s
being metaphysically necessarily existent. And so surely the reason why
something is contingent is **not** that it has potentialities as well as
actualities.",1515
"Again, whether or not you think the number two exists, or whether or not you
accept this model of God, that’s irrelevant, since we are concerned with _in
principle counter-examples_ to the claim that the reason something is
contingent is because it is composite, or that it has potentialities as well
as actualities.",316
"I don’t think, then, that we should be sanguine about what Feser says in the
quoted passage.",92
"Feser: “So, when we say that God is absolutely simple rather than composite
and that he is pure actuality devoid of potentiality, we have given an
_explanation_ of his lacking contingency – that is, of his existing of
necessity.”",229
"But that isn’t the point I was getting at. The point I was getting at is that
even if you have an explanation of the necessity, we can equally well ask, of
your explanation, _why is_ ** _that_** _the case_? What explains God’s being
purely actual and non-composite? [Side note to some: I am not here asking
about what _justifies believing_ that God is purely actual or simple. I’m
asking about what _explains_ why this is so.] And as I argued above in
connection with the propositional necessity understanding of the second IJPR
account, it will ultimately be a primitive or basic fact — a necessary one, to
be sure — that there is this simple, purely actual thing. One cannot appeal to
its simplicity or its pure actuality to explain its simplicity or pure
actuality, for that is circular. And one cannot appeal to its necessity to
explain its simplicity or its pure actuality, since Feser appealed to its
simplicity and/or pure actuality precisely to explain its _necessity_. And so
both accounts end in some primitive fact. Feser might argue that his account
is more illuminating, or that my account stops the explanatory buck too early.
But then I will simply raise the same responses I leveled earlier in comparing
the propositional necessity account to the timeless sustenance account.",1291
"Feser: “By contrast, Schmid’s proposal is that the world is made up of things
that are contingent, composite, and have potentialities as well as actualities
– and yet for all that it is still somehow just a necessary fact about the
world that these things have existential inertia!”",282
"Feser isn’t to blame for this, but — importantly — nothing Feser says here
does anything to target the earlier comparison of the timeless sustenance
account with the propositional necessity understanding of the second IJPR
account. I argued therein that not only is the latter **far** simpler [and,
hence, even if I granted that Feser has an explanatory advantage over this
specific account, it’s an open question whether this sufficiently outweighs
the cost in complexity], but also that the timeless sustenance account raises
more questions than it answers and more mysteries than it resolves, and hence
it is far from obvious whether it is explanatorily superior to the
propositional necessity account in the first place.",724
"Feser: “This is not a case of being presented with a choice between two
alternative possible ultimate explanations, the Thomist’s and Schmid’s.
Rather, it is a case of being presented with a choice between an explanation
and an unexplained and indeed counterintuitive brute fact.”",280
"I have already addressed the reasons Feser proffered on behalf of his
conclusion here, and so I have nothing to add except for the fact that Feser
has not at all successfully done away with the propositional necessity
understanding of the second IJPR account.",259
"For those who want to explore different metaphysical accounts of EIT even

"_For S to fail to exist at m despite existing at (m-1) is for some change to
occur.[Fn] But a change occurs only if some factor causally induces said
change. Hence, if no factor causally induces a change, then the change won’t
occur. Thus, if no factor causally induces S to fail to exist at m despite
existing at (m-1), then S exists at m. Once we add that nothing came along to
causally induce this — that is, once we add that nothing came along to destroy
S from (m-1) to m — it simply follows that S exists at m. [Cf. Section 4.1 in

Existence is something “added” to an essence, and if God stops adding

if we say the passing out of existence isn’t a change in the chair, it is a
change in the room, as the room’s potentiality to be empty has been
actualized. So we need a cause or explanation for that, which entails that a

otherwise we wouldn’t need an explanation for the room suddenly becoming
empty.",604
