As St. Dionysius the Areopagite beautifully wrote ""the being punished is not
an evil, but the becoming worthy of punishment; nor the being deservedly
expelled from Holy things, but the becoming accursed of God, and unholy and
unfit for things un-defiled."" (D.N. 4.22).  
  
God Almighty created nothing ""worthy of punishment"" or ""accursed"", and,
contrary to your claim, the only man that He created was Adam, who has been
redeemed by the New Adam. As St. John of Damascus wrote in Disputatio Saraceni
et Christiani:  
  
""I find nowhere in Scripture that after the first week of making the world God
formed or created anything. If he disputes this, then let him show you the
form or creation made by God after the first week. There is nothing to show.
All visible created things came to be in that week. God made man in the first
week. He ordered him to go forth and multiply. Since man was living with a
living seed, he sowed this seed in his wife. So he generated man, as the
Scripture says: 'Adam generated Seth. Seth generated Enos. Enos generated
Cainan. And Cainan generated Malaleel. Malaleel generated Jared. Jared
generated Enoch.' It does not say that God formed Seth or Enoch, or anyone
else. This we acknowledge, that only Adam was formed by God. All those after
him have and still are generated.""",1323

You neither have disputed any of my arguments nor presented any ""alternative""

rebelled, the fall happened. Did they had horrific consequences? Sure enough.
Did something good happened because of it that would not have happened
otherwise? Definitely yes, namely, you and I are here. More importantly, the
incarnation and the resurrection and the Blessed Virgin mother and the whole

God create Satan if he knew that this devil would lead a rebellion with such

I do not know what you mean by ""Christian theodicy""; as far as the question
itself, yes I did answered. On the other hand, if you mean something like
finding a *moral justification* for God's actions, you are correct that I did

the sense of an entire universe with a different history altogether), worlds
where the fall did not happen or Satan qua Satan does not exist. What I did
and do dispute is that such an alternative world is better, or even better in
some qualified sense. (1) We cannot possibly ascertain such things, because we
have neither the criteria nor the knowledge. (2) Good things happened because
of the rebellion and the fall happened, good things that would not have
happened otherwise and (3) preferring an alternative world where I do not

difficulty for Christianity – as if Christian doctrine would lead us to expect
little or no suffering, so that its adherents should be flummoxed by
suffering’s prevalence. As I have discussed in previous articles, this is the
reverse of the truth. The Catholic faith teaches that suffering [is the
inexorable consequence](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2021/09/the-first-

essential part](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2022/05/nietzsche-and-christ-

overcoming sinful habits of thought and action. It is the inevitable
concomitant of the persecution Christians must face for preaching the Gospel
and condemning the world’s wickedness. It is an inescapable punishment for
sin, which we must embrace in a penitential spirit. By way of suffering we pay
both our own temporal debt and that of others for whom we might offer up our
suffering. By way of it we most closely unite ourselves to Christ’s Passion.
The extent and depth of human suffering thus _confirms_ rather than
disconfirms the claims of Christianity.",1233

Catholic is evidence that I don’t think it’s a problem. It’s of course a very
difficult thing, and the argument is not in any way whatsoever that we should
just ignore suffering in others, to be indifferent to it. Quite the opposite,
doing the small bit we can to help those suffering in their different ways is
part of what we are asked to do. This is why I describe it as a necessary part
of our complete creation, and not as a good in itself. Of course us normal
Catholics don’t envy the suffering in others. However those who have the
deepest relationship with God do often become keen to suffer themselves, so
that they can ‘take up their cross’ and share in the sacrifice of God
incarnate.

We can of course only see that very dimly indeed, but it’s clear that the “new

because of theodicy issues would expect of a good God. No more working in
vain, no more pain of witnessing your children's misfortune. The wolf and the
lamb eat together, even the lion no longer eats other creatures. So it seems
clear to me from revelation that these things are a necessary phase of
creation. When God creates he says it’s “good”, even though He knew it would
contain elements that would not be part of the second creation. Once we were
consciously able to choose between Him and not-Him, we often chose the latter.
However it’s in making this choice correctly when it’s not obvious or easy
that we ‘grow up’, as in we become as our Father intended.  
  
Now I agree with you that we can imagine universes where we would be free and
where we could easily see what is right, where there is no suffering of us or
others to make us ‘loose heart’, and where there are no bright and shiny false
lights with temporary excitement and pleasure. However, like the vines planted
in good, loamy soil, which produce great big bunches of grapes but poor wine,
there is clearly a need for us to struggle a bit in an apparently sub optimal
environment for the creation process to have a successful end point. How God
knows that, we cannot know. Did He tune creation like a quantum experiment,
with all possible realities happening, and from eternity selected the one that
worked best? Or did He just know, because He is infinite and absolute in all
things? I suspect the latter, but the point is that we see a very small part
of the creation process. The people who have the most issue with it nearly
always think the process is complete, and that is their downfall.",1902

a wrong definition of good"". I suppose that this is why you say that
apologists are changing the definition if goodness.  
  
On the christian view, God can be said to do good to us not only in giving us
the chance of Heaven but even in creating we as imperfect as we are. Even
existing badly is better that not existing for being is intrinsically good.
Now, the zoo example and your vegetarianism* show that you disagree with this,
i suppose that being is not good to you on every situation or case and, living
on a world were suffering is so prevalescent, i can see were this come from,
it is a judgment impossible to never make at least for a moment while living
under the sun.  
  
So i think that i see the source of the disagreement here: you and the
christian tradition have diferent views on goodness that change the perception
of this world and the judgment of Goodness Itself making it. To agree with the
christian message you would need a radical change on value that the christian
tradition(at least on your view) need way more evidence to justify.  
  
Anyway, i hope that at least i could make the christian response i'am
defending appear less ad hoc, for i do see it as being internally coherent.

Yes, I know some very spoilt children, and that actually proves my point. In
_this_ world (mild) suffering helps us cope with more suffering but that's
only because _this_ world isn't an ideal world. In an ideal world, no
suffering would be required, just as in an ideal world without fires, no fire
brigade is required.  
  
And even if some mild form of suffering would be good for us, it is still a
very big leap to the amounts of grave suffering we see around us.  
  
Instead of referring to Angels, neither of us knows enough about to draw any
conclysions, let's instead look at people.  
Do the majority of people envy the vast suffering of others? Do you eny that.  
Do the majority of people, including most Christians and Catholics try to
relieve the suffering of others or do they say, ""Well, in the end, it will
turn out good for them""?  
  
That's why suffering , contrary to what Ed claims, is a huge problem for
Christians. And Christians, deep down, know this, but when they put on their
apologetic hats, they explain it away.",1053
"""For my part, I think it's best to honestly acknowledge that some evil in this
world is indeed gratuitous and senseless, and that there are some dark
recesses of the human psyche which God Himself cannot reach: He can console us
while we're in pain, but not while we're in agony, as that severs the
communication channels. In some cases, then, we meet God only on the other
side.""  
  
That seems to severely limit omnipotence, and just the divine power in
general. How is it that God cannot help these people in desperate need?
Especially since he's still the creator of all and has to maintain everything
going, to suggest that he cannot stop a torturer in any way or talk to someone
in their moment of agony seems ridiculous.  
  
Even worse, some people are capable of helping those in need and comforting
them in death. But God can't? I can do something that this God can't, like
that? This is not God, this is some type of friendly alien-parent I have no
intention to worship (although I would be interested in still being friends
with him, more as equals)  
  
And if God cannot help these people at that time of need, how could we even
trust him to be able to help them AFTER death? If anything it just makes it
less likely. He wasn't able to do anything when people were alive, now
suddenly he's gonna be able to help them after death? That seems implausible.  
  
What we need is full-blooded rationalist theodicy coupled with skeptical
theism. There are some morally sufficient reasons for why God allows so many
horrors for a finite time here, and they may well be beyond our understanding.
But God must have his reasons, and he also is capable of compensating for
everything in (perhaps) heaven, an infinite afterlife, etc.  
  
Having to hold that there are morally sufficient reasons for all the evil is
certainly a bad cost, but it's still the best cost (at least in my judgment).
Better than limiting God so much or embracing atheism (both seem more
problematic to me)",1985

Exactly! The problem in the end seems* one of faith, of trusting that God
knows what He is doing even when we dont. He can and does take the good out of
evil, we just do not know how this is so and that is okay.  
  
As St. Augustine shows,we can have some idea of how the bad things are
necessary to the goods on a general sense, but, as he does admit on the book,
how bad things individually have their part only God knows, so in the end we
need to trust.  
  
Walking this path is showing me that a large part of the dificult is exactly
on one relation with God: someone who sees Him as distant or as a idea is more
prone to not being okay with trusting. Bring that together with a focus only
on this life and one will find very dificult to see how God can choose this
world.

I don't agree that existing badly is better than not existing. You are arguing

So, Quark the Ferengi Bartender is a fictional character, but, if we take your
view, He will actually exist some day, because, existing badly is better than
not existing. And that holds for every possible creature.  
Notive also how Jesus says that it would have been better for them if they
hadn't been born.  
That much for intrenal consistency.  
  
On a final note, it is not a christian view that God has the right to kill
just because he is God. The whole idea behind the Fall Theodicy was that only
the guilty die and we are all guilty because of the Fall.

butlets look at this hypothetical scenario, God would not have killed anybody
and everybody would be in His presence without fear.  ",1055
"Vincent, why some people are in anguish and despair when tortured, while
others find themselves in the same state although enjoying all the pleasures
the earth has to offer, is the drama that is human life. It's well-known that
many early Christians gave up the faith when threatened with persecution but
this doesn't detract from the greatness of the sacrifice of so many others. If
one cannot put up a coherent case against the Christian understanding of
suffering, original sin and Redemption, it does not do much good to think
forever and gloomily about suffering. The effort would be better spent
thinking about heaven.  
  
Evil is not ""natural"" or part of the divine plan. Men deprived of the benefits
of original justice are not in a merely natural state, according to St.
Thomas:  
  
(Ia IIae 109): ""We may speak of man in two ways: first, in the state of
perfect nature [state of nature]; secondly, in the state of corrupted nature.
Now in the state of perfect nature, man, without habitual grace, could avoid
sinning either mortally or venially; since to sin is nothing else than to
stray from what is according to our nature - and in the state of perfect
nature man could avoid this... But in the state of corrupt nature man needs
grace to heal his nature in order that he may entirely abstain from sin"".",1317

growth, knowledge, and virtue. But a perfect human is still a _creature_ , and
what is perfect to a creature is not the absolute perfection of God. A perfect

lesser good over a greater good, because of being by design a limited

There is no reason why creatures who do not suffer cannot participate in the
Trinity. In fcat, according to the Fall theodicy, if Adam or Eve (or whoever)
hadn't fallen, they would have partcipated in the Trinity.  
And creatures who do not suffer are not robots and neither are creatures that
do not make evil choices. It's not because I cannot fly all by myself that I
am not a free being.  
And if it is simp;ky a matter of choice, then God could give every creature a
free choice whether or not to participate in the Trinity. No suffering needed
for this.  
  
Repeating a bad theodicy for centuries doesn't make it a good one.

It just a matter of consistency. Unless something is logically impossible, God
can do it. That's what ""omnipotence"" means, unless you are going to redefine
that concept as well.

"The theodicy problem is meaningless because it is based on contradictory
premises. God is not omnipotent in a potential sense, but in an actual sense:
nothing can exist without him. But because of the incomprehensibility of God
it is not possible to draw any conclusions from analogous statements about
God, how the world has to be or what may happen in it. And God's goodness does
not have its measure in our earthly well-being, but consists in the fact that
we are taken up into the love of the Father for the Son, which is the Holy
Spirit. No power of the world can separate us from God. Thus, faith changes

"I think people sometimes take original sin too much like a theory of physics.
Once you do that it can lead to misunderstandings. Perhaps think of it instead
as God creating nature with a telos, in fact a hierarchy of teloi, with
everything drawn towards his divine idea(l)s (using Augustines terms). What
the fall represents is us starting to choose our own sub-teloi, of having
“knowledge” of what is “good” for us. Once we do the conscious choosing, we
generally do a pretty bad job of it, as can be seen immediately with Cain, and
that has consequences that ripple across everything. Like a stone thrown into
a calm pond.  
  
In order to recover our correct place in nature so that we can become
participants in God’s original creation, working with him rather that towards
our own faulty choice of sub-telos, we have to aim towards God’s original
idea(l) of man.  
  
Fortunately He has helped us hugely here. The incarnation was not just(!) the
sacrifice that gained the reconciliation of the consequences of our bad
choices, it also gave us the perfect example of the divine ideal we were
created to be. So in choosing to be more like him, as far as we can in our
puny efforts, we become participants in God’s great act of creation that is
this universe (and we get help in this). On this path even the delights of the
world become good, and we can have life to the full (though not without
suffering yet).  
  
If we don’t - but rather continue to create our own sub-teloi - then even good
intentions can lead us away from completion, away from union with the creator.
For those whose chosen teloi, their highest good and highest desires, are the
base pleasures of the world, it is them who are choosing eternal torment. We
are made to rest in Him, not in base things which will always bring their own
suffering.  
  
I think God spells this all out very clearly in Deuteronomy 30, say verse 11
to the end of the page/chapter.",1934
"""If the tree of life was necessary for Adam and Eve to live forever, one might
reasonably ask, did animals have access to the tree of life? The answer seems
to be no.  
  
If the tree of life was unique, it might have been enough for Adam and Eve to
eat from, but it would never have been enough for all of the animals of the
world to eat from. This may be another sign that the animals were not
understood to have the tree of life for their food. If so, then the text of
Genesis itself would suggest that, while man was meant to be immortal, animals
were not. That would support the idea, based on St. Paul’s statement, that it
was human death that entered the world through the Fall, not animal death.  
  
Furthermore, we should note that giving “every green plant” to animals as food
does not mean that some of them weren’t also carnivores. It’s not as if,
before original sin, lions ate dandelions and toadstools and only afterward
did they begin picking on poor old wildebeest. This is something Thomas
Aquinas wrote about in his Summa Theologica:  
  
In the opinion of some, those animals which now are fierce and kill others,
would, in that state, have been tame, not only in regard to man, but also in
regard to other animals. But this is quite unreasonable. For the nature of
animals was not changed by man’s sin, as if those whose nature now it is to
devour the flesh of others, would then have lived on herbs, as the lion and
falcon.

in the face of modern evolutionary theory, that Thomas wrote these words
nearly 550 years prior to the birth of Charles Darwin.)""",1659

A few of the comments above have brought up the problem of ""animal pain.""
While I understand the standard response to that to be something along the
lines of ""necessity justified in view of the perfection of creation,"" I'm
wondering if there is not a richer answer hidden in the back of our tradition.
Specificly, I'm wondering about the role of angels in all this.  
  
Think of something like Tolkien's cosmology - physical evil and disorder
entered into creation when the principalities and powers of the world (The
Valar and Maiar) entered into conflict with each other, one desiring to
fullfill the creators plan to make a habitation for the ""children of
illuvitar"" (rational life), and others, out to make a dominion for themselves.
As proper ""sub-creators,"" God, in his secondary causality, had given spiritual
beings the duties of care and creation in the physical world, and the flaws,
imperfections, and downright violence of creation were due to the infidelity
of some of the powers intrusted to their care. If we hold the standard line
that fallen angels fell in the first instant of their creation, and, further,
that they had been, nevertheless, been given dominion over certain parts or
aspects of creation, then Johanine language about the ""lord of this world,""
and Pauline language about the ""princes of the powers of the air,"" makes a lot
more sense, and can even be joined to an evolutionary cosmology.  
  
The universe is an odd place, and the creation of the conditions for life, let
alone rational life, in an odd, (physically fallen?) cosmos could be seen as
the fruit of angelic conquest over malign forces. Furthermore, evolution
itself might be seen as being helped along or guided by forces trying to bring
about God's will in creation.

Do i not? One of the classical responses a theist make to the problem of evil
is to say ""there are certain goods that could only be gained in a world like

Well, the christian does have the example of the saints, whose suffering and
hardships make their lifes noble and interesting* not only to us but even to
themselves. To a christian, suffering is supposed to be seen not as a crappy
thing, but as a way of uniting with Christ and climbing the latter to being
similar to Him.  
  
Not only on they but on normal people, perhaps even on your case, you can see
people who look at terrible times they had and see their better situation as
enobled or even justified by the bad times. This even on totally secular
contexts, not considering the beatific vision(who would turn everything
acceptable to the receiver).  
  
This actually seems probably a very alien thinking to a modern unbeliever,
except that Nietzsche did get there, so read eventually the start of the City
of God, the part that Dr. Feser is quoting, slowly and trying to see things
like St. Augustine. Perhaps it help. Likely not, for it is quite a jump.  
  
And remember: this is not a way to us to see this world as justified, but a
way to trying to see how God could see things that way. The same God that do a
lot of things we humans cant do, like kill people and all that.

“ No, suffering is not a necessary part of our creation unless your claim is
that the fall was necessary.  
The point of the Fall is that man and not God is responsible for the Fall, but
nobody can be responsible for a necessary truth. that would be like saying you
are responsible for why 1 + 1 = 2.”  
  
Again, I think this is treating spiritual truth a bit like Newton’s laws of
motion. The fall is a spiritual fall, it’s when spiritual death first
appeared. Death can be seen as disintegration, but the modern, protestant,
literalist mind always assumes this to be physical. Do you really think no
creatures died before Adam and Eve ate the fruit?  
  
Remember also that Lucifer fell from heaven before Adams fall. There is a far
larger canvas here than just Adam and Eve eating something. Creating free,
rational beings seems to inevitably result in at least some of them failing in
terms if pride, and therefore obedience. If it’s not inevitable, it’s at least
the case in Gods perfect plan for creation.  
  
I do however also think that the fall was necessary at some point. We are each
created unique. Some of us are like the prodigal son, and some more like his
brother. There are lessons the Father wants both types to learn as part of the
process of our creation that is this life. Without the ‘fall’ of the prodigal
son, there is no opportunity for either brother to make the right choice to
align with the father. Just as the creation of our bodies was via a process of
ongoing refinement through suffering, our reconciliation with God is a
partaking in the redemptive suffering of God as son of man. It’s of course
true that man caused our fall. But God’s plan, from a perspective we can’t
even imagine yet, is perfect. Nothing has gone wrong. Bizarre as that may seem
to us at times in the middle of it, I believe this to be true.

"Talmid  
  
I do not necessarily reject the idea that being and goodness are the same, but
if that's so, being should be good and not be bad in any way. It doesn't
suffice that every being has ""some"" good, no, being ""is"" good.  
Hence, there cannot be anything bad. And that's the crux of the problem and
that's why the Classical Theism isn't consistent.  
To say that even bad things should exist is simply logically impossible ""if""
being is good. That's a straightforward contradiction.  
  
Sure, if an infinite multiverse exists, then somewhere, Quark the Ferengi
exists. That may not be an insane idea, but it is not the standard Christian
view, which is that God could have chosen not to create anything at all.  
Your claim about qualitative and quantitative maximization is interesting
here, because it contradicts what you claimed before, namely that ""being is
intrinsically good"". if being is intrinsically good, then not being is
intrinsically bad, so Quark the Ferengi not existing would be intrinsically
bad. Whether my ""type"" of goodness exists in someone else doesn't make my non-
existence a good thing.  
  
BTW, Abraham and Isaac came after the Fall, so Isaac was not innocent. Neither
is any foetus in the womb, because they have all  
inherited Original Sin.  
I do not really care about how many Chrurch Fathers agree of disagree with me,
actually. A bad argument is bad, no matter how many Chruch fathers or other
people present it.

suffering is a huge problem for Christianity. And I have explained why.

"There are many horrendous evils that a loving father God should prevent/stop,
and should be able to. For example, many cases of horrendous suffering caused
by some diseases; sexual abuse and torture; etc. The list could go on and on.
And Christians do believe that God does, in fact, sometimes prevent or stop
said evils through (for example) miracles or providence. So it is a problem
why there are still so many of these evils going on and our loving Father does
nothing about it - not even when people desperately or earnestly pray and beg
him for help.  
  
""And how could God prevent the evils in the world without also preventing the
wonderful goods that accidentally give rise to them or to which by Divine
mercy they lead?""  
  
I do not know with certainty that God could do that. But it does seem like
there are many cases of seemingly gratuitous, horrible evil - which God should
therefore prevent or stop. And again, Christians do believe that God does that
in some cases, too (either through miracle or providence). So the problem
seems pressing to me.  
  
I believe in God, so in the end I do think that there is some greater good
that is achieved with God not-intervening, or allowing this universe to just
be full of suffering and horror for some time, etc. I hope there is a morally
sufficient reason for it all and that the Form of the Good (God) is not so
distant from our love, hopes and needs. But this is a serious epistemic cost -
because when I look at the world, it does seem like there are purely
gratuitous horrendous evils, or that God should be doing better, and so on.
It's a bad epistemic cost, one that I wish I could avoid, and it makes me
think that some people truly are reasonable in their position of atheism. I
personally just happen to find theism to be harder to deny, rationally
speaking, so I think it offsets the problem of evil in the end. But I think
it's a serious problem and we don't have a simple solution to it either in
philosophy or religion.

as the ground of being (as all real believers do), versus considering Him as
“a being” (as most atheists do) affects so much of your perspective. It’s not
a fact among other facts. The reality is more like our understanding is a
wall, with boxed up bricks of conclusions. As humans we find it difficult to
look at the contents of more than one brick at a time. From an evolutionary
perspective this is understandable. When you need food, or there is a lion at
the cave entrance, you don’t want to be thinking about ways to make clothes,
how the sun moves through the sky etc. In the modern world the foundations of
the wall tend to be physics, chemistry, maths, geology, economics, politics
etc, which themselves have foundations built on a reduction to small things
(pebbles). Once you believe in God, that is always the foundation stone. To me
this is why literalist, fundamentalist protestants have such a problem with

wicked men. The Christian must also _criticize them_ for their wickedness, and
try to get them to repent of it. To be sure, Augustine goes on to acknowledge
that there may be occasions where one might justifiably opt to postpone such
criticism until an opportune moment, or refrain from it out of a reasonable
fear of doing more harm than good. But he teaches here that it is _not_
justifiable to refrain from such criticism merely because it is difficult, or
because we fear causing offense and losing friends, or because we don’t want
to risk losing status or other worldly goods. For the wicked are in danger _of
damnation_ if they do not repent, and we “wickedly blind ourselves” if we
shirk our duty to encourage them to do so. Even if we avoid damnation
ourselves, we will justly suffer alongside them when divine providence visits

The little logic puzzles that you are setting are tricks that you are playing
on yourself.  
  
""If logic is contingent, so is God, because the proposition 'God exists' is,
in that case, a contingent truth.""  
  
Contingent logic and contingent truth are not the same thing. Logic is a
procedure that, properly used, takes us from one truth to another. Contingent
truth is not absolute truth. ""It takes an hour to swim across the lake"",
depends on the lake, the person swimming, and other contingent factors. God
knows all the contingencies. They are in the infinite sequence which is
contingent to us, but not to God, who is absolute truth. Furthermore, the
infinite sequence is an _image_ of God, a Divine Idea, meaning that God knows
it. But an image of God is not God any more than the pixels in your digital
photo of a tree are the tree. You cannot say that the tree does not have sap
because the photo does not have sap. Similarly, you cannot say that God is
contingent from the entertainment of an image of God. The image does not show
what God is, but it shows what you cannot say that God is not. Because people,
made in the image of God, can be stupid does not imply that God is stupid.  
  
God has no procedure of using logic. God knows the procedure of logic that you
use. He created it. That procedure, properly used, is whatever God wills it to
be. Whatever he wills it to be, it still allows humans to reason from one
contingent truth to another within the composite contingent truths that humans
understand.

even suffer and die. Now, is these beings existence good enough that they are
desirable?  
  
You answer ""not necessarily"" for, from what i remember, you reject the ur-
platonist view that being and goodness are the same, so your criteria of what
a good thing is probably(i can only supose) tied to happiness in a way that
unhappiness in a large level is not the type of thing that should be desirable
at all.  
  
By contrast, someone like Aquinas would argue that even beings so fragile are
desirable for their existence allow for a major variety of good things and
even their decay and corruption is in a sense, and only in a sense, desirable
for the corruption of one material thing aways result in other things(even if
not usually living) and so ad variety.  
  
Remember that later pagans and ancient and medieval christians took effort to
argue against the gnostic view that the material world is bad because of the
inevitable corruption and decay its existence creates, which seems alive on
today antinatalists, so the view i'am defending does argue that even beings
that can and do suffer and die are good. The realism on universals, evil as

point all along. From the beginning, contrary to what Ed claims, suffering was
a problem and hence, from the beginning, there was a a need for theodicies.  
God may be good in only an analogous way, but an analogy has something in
common with what it is compared to, and your definition of goodness is
contrary to what is generally understood by goodness. What is more important
is that I think you are a good person and that in everyday life you use the
same definition of goodness that I do.  
And on that definition of goodness, every possibilty of evil would be ruled
out if that were possible. But yiurb definition of god's goodness is simply
circular ""Good is what God does and whatever god does is good"".  
  
It is indeed so that the Christian good is not all good in any meaningful

You write:  
  
As Augustine says, there isn’t “any evil [that] happens to the faithful and
godly which cannot be turned to profit,” so that, with St. Paul, “we know that
all things work together for good to them that love God” (Romans 8:28).  
  
I have to say that Augustine's remark sounds very Pollyanna-ish. There are
some evils which can only be described as soul-breaking, rather than soul-
making. Three which come to mind are rape, mutilation and torture. These are
horrendous sufferings which serve no ""greater good,"" and which can destroy
even a good individual's faith, as the following account of the 17th century
""torture in the pit"" illustrates:  
  
https://sspx.org/en/news-events/news/real-life-silences-character  
  
There were priests, many of them good men, who apostasized. What good was
served?  
  
You also cite Augustine to support the following claim: ""We cannot achieve
happiness in the world to come if we become too attached to the world that is,
and suffering is a means of preventing the latter.""  
  
This might explain some of the suffering that befalls adults, but it fails to
explain the death and suffering of a child, who has no worldly attachments.  
  
Finally, original sin (or the fall of Adam) is said to be the ultimate
explanation for why humans are permitted to suffer and die, rather than
enjoying immortality and bliss. I am not persuaded that a dumb choice by a
distant ancestor makes it fair for us to be allowed to suffer soul-breaking
evils of the sort described above, but let that pass. What original sin cannot
explain is the fact that people (e.g. political prisoners, psychiatric
patients) have been beaten or tortured to death, while screaming for Divine
deliverance or at least some Divine consolation (i.e. a sense of ""I am with
you"") at the moment of death, and in many cases, it never arrives: they die in
agony and desolation. Spiritual abandonment at the hour of death is the most
difficult evil of all to make sense of, and if you can make any sense of it,
Ed, you're a better man than I.  
  
For my part, I think it's best to honestly acknowledge that some evil in this
world is indeed gratuitous and senseless, and that there are some dark
recesses of the human psyche which God Himself cannot reach: He can console us
while we're in pain, but not while we're in agony, as that severs the

to the same anguish, virtue and vice are not the same thing. For as the same
fire causes gold to glow brightly, and chaff to smoke… so the same violence of
affliction proves, purges, clarifies the good, but damns, ruins, exterminates
the wicked. And thus it is that in the same affliction the wicked detest God

it make, not what ills are suffered, but what kind of man suffers them_.",752

well as the wicked, though not equally with them, love this present life;
while they ought to hold it cheap, that the wicked, being admonished and
reformed by their example, might lay hold of life eternal... For so long as
they live, it remains uncertain whether they may not come to a better mind.

""it is possible to inevitably choose something?""  
  
Yes Walter. In the temporal paradise nothing would end it except a voluntary
exit (freely choosing to turn away from the presence of God). So an infinitude
of time was available, unmarred by fear, aging, or death.  
  
Now let us look at the simple model of human free will in time (in the
temporal paradise) - an infinite sequence of unbiased bits, in which lies all
possible intelligible choices encoded one way or other (you, Walter, can
choose any encoding method subject to finite computation).  
  
To be unbiased, the infinite sequence would have to contain, as a subsequence,
the choice to turn away from God (exit paradise). If the infinite sequence did
not contain the choice as a subsequence, the infinite sequence would not be an
unbiased random sequence and it would not be simple but would be complex.  
  
So the free choice to turn from God, given endless time, is inevitable.

Original sin was the fall of creation and suffering was the consequence of
this fall. We are all in this fallen creation. No one is being ""punished"", not
even Adam and Eve. They just inevitably chose sin given free will and time.
Human free will can also be modelled by an infinite unbiased random binary
sequence so all choices exist in it somewhere (as simple a model as you are
likely to find). Adam and Eve, in time, chose to leave temporal paradise and
enter the fallen creation. Knowledge of good and evil meant a return to
temporal paradise was gone without the intervention of God to bring them to
the new creation, the eternal (outside of time) paradise with God.  
  
This is where we are, all of us, people, babies, good people, bad people,
dogs, ticks, mosquitos, and viruses. There is only one creation (simplicity
again). We are all in it together. God did not cause multiple worlds for each
to choose, and by the choice define right and wrong (for you are the one
claiming to redefine things, not me). As a human with an infinite component to
your mind, since you are free, you can always choose your own way to stay
separate from God. In eternity (outside of time), when the new creation
replaces this one, choosing will no longer be possible, so if you have elected
to be separate from God, you will stay separate from God.  
  
The world we live in is not so by necessity. It could have been anything
(modelled by the random sequence). It could have been a world in which 1+ 1 is
3 and the rules of logic could have been anything. But the world we live in is
the way it is because of love. Love, not necessity. Love is why after
inevitably (given endless time) exiting temporal paradise, there is still
Salvation if you freely choose it. The innocent, even mosquitos (which are
actually rather beautiful) will have an appropriate room in God's eternal
mansion, where the leopard lies down with the kid and the suckling child plays

God’s presence. They just couldn’t even stand. Peter, James and John collapsed
at the transfiguration. Paul collapsed on the road to Damascus. It is clearly
something inexpressibly overwhelming, such greatness that it inspires an awe
and fear that is well beyond normal human experience. That’s just being in His
presence. We’re talking about consciously participating in His being. This is
of course beyond our imagination, even those who have experienced something of
it cannot describe anything at all of it. So to assume that it’s just like you

I see what you are saying. Just a correction: on the view i'am defending God
is beyond what we usually mean by good, for He has no essence separate from
His essence that He must be a great exemplar of, but is THE good that we all
recept a fraction, you could say. It is not a case of the voluntaristic view
were God chooses things to be good for no reason so i dont see much
circularity. The name ""good"" that we use to Him mean only that He has no lack,
but it has little to do with our virtues.  
  
Now, could this Being, beyond our good but also its cause, choose something
that we would not choose? I would say that we just cant know much of this
answer a priori. Since God has no nature that we can separate from Him and say
""His nature is to choose such and such"" them there is a sense were, while He
can by no means be evil*, He is sure hard to predict.  
  
Notice that the monotheistic-or-close pagans, that had no Bible, normally did
not really treat God as much similar to us. This because pure reason cant
really show much of how He thinks, only that He cant be bad(and what i
mentioned below). This world, revelation, the Incarnation, these are all
suprises that say a bit more of who He is but only say so much.

these cases most children don’t understand the end good. A few children may
trust their parents, and so for them (and there parents!) it’s not really a

Where suffering of animals is as part of nature, we must trust that to God.
Life could not have evolved without suffering, and we must trust that the rich
tapestry of dark and light is perfectly rounded in the end. “All is well” as
He told Julian of Norwich. This is just faith in God’s goodness, and I have
confidence that the great suffering of animals in nature will make be a
necessary part of a perfect plan when we see things as they are.  
  
Where it’s caused by humans, we are responsible. We each are called to play
our part in reducing the suffering of others, as far as we are able. I can’t
judge a poor person who overworks a donkey to build a house, or buys factory
farmed meat, but those who can afford to support better welfare and always
choose the cheapest/cruelest must be at least partly responsible for the
cruelty.  
  
It’s similar with children. We can’t see God’s full plan, but we know that
life is short for all of us next to eternity. We can only play our part in
reducing it where we can, and trust the rest to God.  
  
As Augustine alludes to, some who have suffered the most can become the
purest, most loving people you could meet. Others become hard and cruel. God
is refining us like “silver in the furnace”. If we go with the process as he
asks us to, and most of the saints actually welcome suffering in themselves,
we have good reason to believe that it’s to our benefit in the long run. Most
difficult of course is when it’s others suffering, especially those we love.
But it’s exactly the same in that we can do what we can to help (including
righteous anger in the very rare cases where that is the right response), but
must do all we can to avoid becoming hard and cruel ourselves in response.
Difficult as it may be, we must trust. We must try to see that what is sharp
and apparently meaningless in the moment, is very different from the widest
perspective.

created order. The created order is good (not even Satan wants to destroy it
to the point of non-existence which is what you are arguing entails, rather he

""since he was the one who put the sequence there in the first place, He knew
exactly what was going to happen and when it was going to happen""  
  
The sequence is just a model of unpredictable simplicity. It is not an
ordering of creation.  
  
""Adam, just like the rest of us, was always doomed and has always been in need
of redemption. There was no fall, Human beings were created fallen right from

This awe and fear of being in God’s presence is not something he inspires,
it’s His infinite greatness perceived by a finite creature. It’s the shock of
reality unveiled. From behind the veil, at times He spills over such that we
can experience a diluted form of His presence where words like gentle, tender,
love, peace etc are used. For now we only see dimly, our perception is
naturally tuned to dim reality, and so it’s in this diluted form that most of
us can distinguish anything other than infinite ‘brightness’.  
  
In general you take a position that conflicts with everything revealed in
scripture. So where do you get your information on what God is, what God could
do and couldn’t do? If it’s just reason, then what makes you think you can
understand the timeless and the infinite? We can’t even think without time. If
you ignore revelation, what makes you think humans are able to understand such
things any more than ants can understand Special Relativity?  
  
When Jesus Bar Joseph was convicted, Pilate gave the people the option to
choose between him and Jesus Barabbas (“son of the father”). Two messianic
figures representing two different human perspectives, one human, one divine.
Peter originally saw Jesus as the human version, and Jesus responded with “Get
thee behind me Satan”.  
  
This is made clearer by the three temptations that Jesus was given in the
desert. Satan did not ask for worship, as he is more sly than that. He
presented different versions of this human perspective, which relate to
suffering, power, and image (being liked or admired). Satan even quotes
scripture, the master theologian using scripture to sell the human
perspective.  
  
This is what spiritual discernment is all about. You can use Ignatian
exercises to help with this, you can go on silent retreat (even into the
desert). You can go to weekly mass and a weekly holy hour in silence. Where
you almost certainly won’t ‘get’ why your reasoning doesn’t resonate with
people who trust God is in theology or philosophy books, or internet forums
(interesting as they may be).",2095
"There is no obligation to give correction if you have a confidence it won't be
heeded. That likelihood of no good being accomplished may make it prudent to
not give the correction, especially in the face of tremendous harm caused by
losing your job.  
  
But I think it would be worth keeping an eye towards how could you situate
things so that the correction would be better received (establish goodwill and
trust in the relationship and being thoughtful about how you go about with the
correction) and/or make the harms more manageable (diversify your income)
and/or less likely to occur (be irreplaceable at your job).",621

""The main point is whether we could call a being who wants a world of
suffering ""good.""  
  
Well, we can't. I do call Him Goodness Itself and other cool names, though.  
  
A essencial part of this christian theodicy* is that God has a relation with
morality totally diferent than our own, see for instance the fact that He can
judge people, can kill people, can pester people until they want to do His
thing(see Jonah) etc. The Book of Job lets this clear when God finally
appears, for Job is trying to tread God as a equal the whole time, who needs
to explain His actions to him and all that, and when He finally appears He
makes very clear that Job treatment of Him as how we would do a normal person
is completely ridiculous.  
  
So the idea that God is good yes but on a more analogical than univocal way is
not a clever apologetical invention but is there on the religions of the book
since the beginning. It just sounds bizarre to me to see someone argue
otherwise, specially when the ""the names Scripture uses to talk of God should
not be understood as exactly what they mean in us"" is a thing since the church
fathers.  
  
This is important, for if God goodness is not exactly our own them His
priorities can be diferent. And, well, on the christian worldview the struggle
a believer has to be become holy, the life and struggles of the animals etc
are goods that let the universe better.  
  
Notice that even we can see value in something that requires suffering. For
instance, would you rather we, suppose we could, put all savage animals in
zoos and other controlated environments and make the ecosistems that exist now
stay functioning artificially or you would want to also let places were there
are animals living like they do and only interfere to not let extinctions and
things like that happen?

explanation must posit the existence of something which is absolutely _un_

the source of all other reality – it would possess “the _highest_ causality…

notion of causality, he argues, applies only _within_ the phenomenal world,

"Splendid! Finally an actual argument.  
  
Let’s recap: your initial claim is that the logical problem of evil provides
good philosophical reasons not to believe in the God of classical theism
because it shows there is no way to reconcile the bad things that happen to
people with “Omni” attributes we want to affirm about God.  
  
A response to this claim was then given that one possible “out” that can
preserve these divine attributes by hypothesizing that God could make
restitution to the wronged parties in the next life.  
  
You then made a bunch of irrelevant remarks about how everyone who disagrees
with you on this topic is stupid, and most people probably gave up on the
conversation. But now we actually have a non-trivial and non-circular
response! An immortal soul cannot exist that survives after death because we
don’t know how a soul interacts with the brain, so it is therefore impossible
for God to offer restitution to a person after death.  
  
Now that we have that all our of the way, ready for the philosophy? You sure?
Ok here it is:  
  
I reject your premise. An unsolved question is not a demonstration that two
concepts are incompatible.  
  
This is further justified by the arguments that Dr. Feser has made here (and
others have made elsewhere) that the mind cannot be wholly materially
determinate, and that there must be an immaterial component to our thoughts
(which is positive evidence for the soul).  
  
I conclude that the above theodicy has not been rebutted, and therefore the
problem of evil fails to demonstrate what you want to claim.",1582

What do ""stripped of all its properties"" means? Even if you take away all of a
being visible characteristics there would still be the potentials, the thing
being a composite of essence and existence, the thing having started to be

Besides, I'am against conceivability arguments in general. Aunt May sure can
conceive of a Spiderman that is not Peter Parker, this is what she does, but
he is still the Spider. But this is the less important point, for the argument
is not the normal conceivability argument.  
  
On top of that, our cognition starts by a thing characteristics, we only know
the substance latter, and we classify things according to the characteristics
it has, so it is should not suprise us that we cant conceive of it with no
characteristics.  
  
I mean, a human is a rational animal, the essence is separated by its
characteristics. The diference between one essence and another is the
essencial characteristics any has, so it is no wonder that we cant
diferentiate one from another once we take the essencial characteristics away.

too simple to read Hume as a mere skeptic, full stop. True, he does try to
undermine traditional metaphysical views about substance, causation, the self,
moral value, etc. But he also emphasizes that the hold such notions have over
common sense cannot be shaken by philosophical skepticism, since they are too
deeply rooted in human psychology. And for purposes of “common life,” they are
indispensable. Hume’s aim is merely to clip the wings of highfalutin

"Moreover, as I have argued, if you do accept these background views, then to
be consistent you’d have to draw other conclusions that most New Atheist types
would not want to draw. Again, if you accept a Humean critique of natural
theology, then to be consistent you should also be skeptical about the claims
of natural science and ethics to tell us anything about objective reality. And
if you accept a Kantian critique of natural theology, then while you can
consistently take natural science and ethics to have a rational basis, you
cannot consistently treat theology with the contempt that Dawkins and Co.
typically do. Hence the lessons so many have drawn from Hume’s and Kant’s
critiques is not the one either of those critiques actually supports.",752
"All the same, Kant’s critique of natural theology did not stem from the view
that it is an irrational enterprise.  Quite the contrary. The New Atheist
supposes that all theology reflects an insufficient respect for reason. Kant
argues, by contrast, that in fact natural theology reflects an _excessive
confidence_ in the power of reason. In particular, it reflects the conviction
that ultimate explanation is possible, that the world can be made intelligible
through and through. Nor did Kant suppose that natural theology looked for
such explanation in the crudely anthropomorphic “sky daddy” of New Atheist
caricature. Here is how he describes the basic impulse behind philosophical
theism in the _Critique of Pure Reason_ :",726
"Again, in Kant’s view, it is not the abandonment of reason, but rather the
attempt to fulfill reason’s ultimate ambitions, that yields natural theology.
And reason will remain frustrated even in the face of Kantian attempts to show
that this ambition cannot be fulfilled. It is “quite beyond our utmost efforts
to _satisfy_ our understanding in this matter” but “equally unavailing are all
attempts to induce it to acquiesce in its incapacity” (p. 513).",453
"Dr. Feser,  
  
How do you think Kant's nominalism played into his abandonment of metaphysical
proofs for God's existence? Michael Oberst recently wrote an article in
History of Phil Quarterly (2015) where he notes that while Kant says little
explicitly about universals, his recent interpreters agree that he ""rejected
universals."" Oberst agrees with some nuance (trying to situate Kant in some
middle ground between nominalism and realism).  
  
Without getting into exegesis of Kant on this point, do you think nominalism
might account for his denial of metaphysical proofs? It seems to me that his
nominalism would account for this and for his epistemology as well (with
nominalism understood as the denial of universal, extra mental form). Any

"WCB, this is a philosophy blog. We do philosophy here. If logical
demonstrations don’t qualify as “hard evidence” for you, you can go back to
Matt Dillihunty et al.  
  
The problem of evil (or at least the logical version of the problem of evil
that you keep harping on about), is a philosophical demonstration that the
existence of evil is inconsistent with God’s attributes of goodness,
omnipotence, etc. If Plato’s good work an argument provides a potential “out”
then the argument in the problem of evil fails because the conclusion does not
follow from the premises.  
  
Notice how in the thousands of words that Dr. Feser has devoted to the topic
of existential inertia, he has never once asked “where is the hard evidence
for existential inertia?” Because it doesn’t matter if you have independent
reasons to think such a thing exists. If the mere possibility of it’s
existence is consistent with the metaphysical premises of the classical
theists, then (most) cosmological arguments fail.

“The history of Immanuel Kant's life is difficult to portray, for he had
neither life nor history. He led a mechanical, regular, almost abstract
bachelor existence in a little retired street of Königsberg, an old town on
the north-eastern frontier of Germany. I do not believe that the great clock
of the cathedral performed in a more passionless and methodical manner its
daily routine than did its townsman, Immanuel Kant. Rising in the morning,
coffee-drinking, writing, reading lectures, dining, walking, everything had
its appointed time, and the neighbors knew that it was exactly half-past three
o'clock when Kant stepped forth from his house in his grey, tight-fitting
coat, with his Spanish cane in his hand, and betook himself to the little
linden avenue called after him to this day the ""Philosopher's Walk."" Summer
and winter he walked up and down it eight times, and when the weather was dull
or heavy clouds prognosticated rain, the townspeople beheld his servant, the
old Lampe, trudging anxiously behind Kant with a big umbrella under his arm,
like an image of Providence.  
  
What a strange contrast did this man's outward life present to his
destructive, world-annihilating thoughts! In sooth, had the citizens of
Königsberg had the least presentiment of the full significance of his ideas,
they would have felt far more awful dread at the presence of this man than at
the sight of an executioner, who can but kill the body. But the worthy folk
saw in him nothing more than a Professor of Philosophy, and as he passed at
his customary hour, they greeted him in a friendly manner and set their
watches by him.”

Its been a while since i read The Laws, but in there Plato argues for:  
  
\- the existence of gods, with his cosmological argument that leads to the
existence of souls  
\- self movers - that started all other movement.  
  
\- That the gods care about us, by pointing out that a better caretaker cares
about the details of his works, so the gods do care about everything.  
  
If these arguments come before Book X, i dont remember, them the Good Workman
Argument does sound reasonable to one who accept these premises. Like Kant
moral argument, hard to dismiss if you agree with the initial premises, it is
just that atheists do not.  
  
About the problem of evil, i dont remember Plato adressing it at all*, but he
believed that:  
  
\- the soul is living in a innatural condition when stuck in the body  
  
\- that the soul is only happy when it goes to the intellectual goods, which
every soul has the potential to do.  
  
\- that after death the soul just goes eventually to another body  
  
It seems that these premises do help developing a response to the problem of
evil. Proclus,probably the best neoplatonist, did make a interesting little
book on it, worth a reading.  
  
*makes sense that the hebrews would know it(see the Torah and Job) before him, the gods that the atheists/agnostics of his time were discussing were the greek ones, so it would not come from they, and Plato was not only a elitist but also probably a ascetic, hardly the guy to care about lower people not having material goods",1528

Danny's soul that is intellectually deficient? Or does his deficient brain
throttle his soul's itellect? How about Hiram? Is his soul's real IQ 200?
Could it be we are all deficient as to our brains and withou that, we would
all have IQs of 200?""  
  
It will depend on the school, but most dualists i can think of can account for
this.  
  
Take for instance the more platonic/dharmic/spiritist view that the soul is a
substance whose nature is other than the body and that not only has no
necessary conection with it but is actually weakened by being stuck with it.
This is pretty straightfoward here: the soul is stuck with the body
limitations and so its natural capacities will be worser on a crappier body.  
  
Take now the cartesian view were the soul is a substance whose nature is other
than the body but is made to function with the body. Here the sould and the
body must function together to it to work well, so a bad body will make the
soul less capable of functioning.  
  
Now take the thomistic view were the soul is the form of the body. Here things
also work well, for the body is responsable for sense data, memory and
imagination and the intellect(that the soul is responsable for) needs sense
data everytime it needs to function*, so if the body do not work well, them
the sould is screwed.  
  
So it seems that the forms of dualism defended by philosophers, at least with
a religious mindset, can work well on this case. The only type of dualism i
can't see explaining it is the one you see on most fiction with superhumans or
magic were someone can turn into a fly or a bird, say, and still think. If the
soul can work well on these situations, brain damage should be easy.

Well, Kant starts with the humean thesis that sense data can only generate
contigent knowledge. He quickly realized that empiricism is dumb, for we do
have necessary knowledge, so he was a sort of rationalist early. Necessary
knowledge comes from reason.  
  
But them Kant understood that sense data is pretty much how we have
information about reality, so if our necessary knowledge does not come from
the senses them it either:  
  
1\. Has no basis on reality and is mere play with definitions(which smart
empiricists do defend).  
  
2\. Come from something else.  
  
The prussian argued that at least mathematics is a sort of necessary knowledge
that is not created by language, so 2 won. His answer was that we can know
some truths about how we happen to organize sense data by analysing the
necessary conditions to our experience to it to be how it is. For instance,
every experience we have is in time, it has a sucession and all that, so we
can derive several truths about that(inded, mathematics would have his origin
on the forms of time and space).  
  
And so, by knowing this structure we could show that every possible experience
we could have need to obey a certain structure and so gather several truths
about how things appear to us. This method is worthless to know things we cant
empirically know, though.",1531

thinks metaphysical principles (e.g. every event must have a cause) can only
be justified in virtue of their expressing conditions of the possibility of
experience, viz. the conditions objects must satisfy in order to be objects of
experience _for us_. But this suggests the need to distinguish between two
says of considering objects, namely in relation to subjects with our forms of
cognition (things as they appear to us) and independently of such relations
(things as they are in themselves).

satisfactory, but I hope this brief summary shows it isn't some misguided
attempt to undermine natural theology.",954
"Kant was one of the world's greatest thinkers. He phillosophy foresaw quantum
mechanics.  
  
Kant did not view things-in-themselves as containing the sum of all
possibilities, and phenomena all actualities; but this duality is conformable
to Kant's metaphysics as to none other. As a contribution to the metaphysics
of possibility, the quantum mechanical wave function can easily be seen as
complementary to Kant's idea of things-in-themselves, where various kinds of
things can happen (like free will) that are not comprehensible in terms of
phenomenal reality. Kant would just have to allow that characteristics of
physical reality can intrude some depth into things-in-themselves, which he
would not have considered -- though we can also handle this by positing an
intermediate level of reality, between true unconditioned things-in-themselves
and true discrete phenomenal objects -- as Kant otherwise actually does
himself for space and time as ""pure intuitions."" The wave function straddles
the classic Kantian boundary, sharing some properties with phenomena, others,
as underlying phenomena, with things-in-themselves.  
  
Thus, where Kant would have considered all of phenomena governed by
determinism, we now see the wave function as deterministic, while the collapse
of waves into particles is random. Although chance in quantum mechanics has
often been argued as allowing for free will, a free cause is still a very
different thing from a random cause, which doesn't need mind or self or
intention. Moral freedom is thus still left among things-in-themselves. Kant
himself would have had difficulty placing randomness in his ontology, if he,
like Hume, believed that chance violates determinism. Since chance is now part
of the physics, it cannot be denied; but it also still remains a different
matter from purposive freedom.  
  
Kant's idea that space and time do not exist among things-in-themselves has
been curiously affirmed by Relativity and quantum mechanics. In Relativity,
time simply ceases to pass at the velocity of light: for photons that have
travelled to us as part of the Cosmic Background Radiation, time has stood
still for most of the history of the universe. On the other hand, quantum
mechanics now posits ""non-locality,"" i.e. physical distances, and so the
limitation of the velocity of light in Relativity, don't seem to exist. This
means that although time may apply to the wave function, space may not. The
full empirical reality of space is only found among discrete particles and
objects.  
  
This curious result is the consequence of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
Paradox, which was intended by Einstein as a reductio ad absurdum of quantum
mechanics. If, for instance, a positron and an election are both created from
an energetic photon, the conservation of angular momentum requires that one be
spinning one way, and the other the other. But the complementary spins are
equally probable for each particle. Thus, in quantum mechanical terms, the
wave functions of each particle divide without a discrete state being
determined. The particles might then separate to even cosmological distances,
but as soon as the spin of one particle is observed, the other particle must
have the opposite spin, which means that the wave function has collapsed
across those cosmological distances and caused the other particle to assume a
predictable spin. If this occurs instantaneously, it would violate the
limitation of the velocity of light in Special Relativity.  
  
This has now been shown to actually occur on the basis of Bell's Theorem (from
John Bell, 1928-1990), meaning that Quantum Mechanics does violate Special
Relativity by allowing instantaneous interactions across even cosmological
distances. However, once observed, processes must still obey Special
Relativity and the limitations of spatial distance, creating the kind of
duality described by Kant.

are more like finding a bunch of leaves organised in a perfect triangle, which
obviously can't be caused by non-intelligent causes, but either by animals or
humans.  
  
And so arguments from design get us closer to God insofar as they purport to
show evidence which points to an intelligent cause, and one that's above us as
well. Which COULD still be explained by agents other than God, but at least
that narrows things down a lot - they have to be intelligent and powerful
agents.  
  
Furthermore, it gives credibility to accounts which say God is the one who
created life on Earth directly, which is a pre-existing claim which can be
supported somewhat, in a real way, with design arguments, even though not
strictly proved by them.",816
"Suppose I kept finding leaves in my yard near a certain tree, and hypothesized
that my neighbor was intentionally dumping them there. Suppose you pointed out
that the number and arrangement of the leaves is perfectly consistent with
their having fallen there from the tree as a result of the wind, or because
squirrels or other animals are knocking them off the branches. Suppose I
responded: “Sure, my argument doesn’t go _all_ the way to establishing that my
neighbor is responsible, but the evidence gets me at least _part_ of the way
there.” You would no doubt be unimpressed. Sure, my neighbor _could_ have put
the leaves there, but there is simply nothing in the evidence that requires
such a distinctively human cause (as opposed to an inanimate cause like the
wind, or a non-human animal). So the support the presence of the leaves gives
my hypothesis is negligible at best.",882
"Dr. Feser said: ""The point I am making is essentially the same as the one Kant
famously made when he argued that what he called “physico-theological”
arguments (an example of which would be Paley’s design argument) cannot in the
nature of the case get us to God, but only to a kind of architect of the
world.""  
  
While true, the proponent of arguing for God via the 'hypothesis' / best
explanation (abductive) route could then claim that 'God being the architect'
is the best hypothesis of which architect it is. Thus, something like Paley's
argument can get you to God. I have a forthcoming paper in TheoLogica arguing
for this: that the theoretical virtues of beauty, simplicity, and unification
make it rational to believe that, for example, the personal creator posited by
the kalam (or fine-tuning) is actually a perfect being (i.e., God) rather than
some lesser creator being.

"First, what is a hypothesis? Wuellner’s _Dictionary of Scholastic Philosophy_
provides a useful first approximation:",116
"Now, I am citing works in the Scholastic tradition to reflect the point of
view from which I approach these matters, but on this particular issue I don’t
think Wuellner’s and Carlson’s account differs in any relevant way from what
your average non-Scholastic philosopher or scientist would say. The idea is,
first, that a hypothesis is a tentative explanation of some empirical event
that will occur _under certain conditions_. Hence, suppose some effect _E_
occurs under certain conditions of type _T_. We might hypothesize that a cause
of type _C_ is responsible, and then go on to test this by bringing about an
instance of _C_ under conditions of type _T_ and seeing whether an instance of
_E_ follows. If it does not, we might form some new hypothesis, to the effect
that it is another sort of cause (of type _D_ , say) that is responsible. But
even if our prediction is confirmed, it is possible in principle that it is
nevertheless not really _C_ that is producing _E_ , but some other causal
factor that is merely correlated with _C_. So we’d need to do further testing
to rule that possibility out. And in any event, if there really is some causal
connection between _C_ and _E_ , only such empirical investigation is going to
reveal it, because the causal relationship between them, even if real, is
going to be _contingent_. Again, it will be _possible_ that something other
than _C_ is the cause, so that the most that further testing can do is render
this supposition _improbable_ (even if, perhaps, _highly_ improbable).",1534

personalism a level 2 and classical theism a level 3. William Lane Craig has
expressed his level 2 conception in this manner: you can use scientific
information in a philosophical argument to make theological conclusions. Where
you have said that theological philosophy or natural theology should be
grounded in the philosophy of nature not the natural sciences. Although I like
your leaf analogy in showing that level 2 partial explanation would be
deficient, I was wondering wouldn’t a level 4 (unitive experience) and level 5
(beatific vision) conception render a level 3 conception deficient as well,
consequently undermining a classical theistic approach? Shouldn’t we just see
each conception on a pathway to a mature and fuller understanding of God? Or
would you argue that a level 2 conception of God, despite some ostensible
apologetic utility, does more damage than good, in a way that a level 3
conception does not when compared to a level 4 and 5? And if so how so?  
Greg Matthews",1402
"The ""God Hypothesis"" is just another Ultimate Why question, which Paul Edwards
addressed many years ago in a Intro to Phil textbook  
  
""Regarding our second issue, cosmic why questions, Edwards begins by
considering what he calls “the theological why.” The theological answer to the
theological why posits that a god answers the question of meaning. Major
difficulties here include how we could say anything intelligible about such
disembodied minds, as well as all of the other difficulties involved with
justifying such beliefs. Edwards focuses particularly on whether the
theological answer really answers the question, mentioning a number of
philosophers in this regard: “Schopenhauer referred to all such attempts to
reach a final resting place in the series of causes as treating the causal
principle like a ‘hired cab’ which one dismisses when one has reached one’s
destination. Bertrand Russell objects that such writers work with an obscure
and objectionable notion of explanation: to explain something, we are not at
all required to introduce a “self-sufficient” entity, whatever that may
be…Nagel insists that it is perfectly legitimate to inquire into the reasons
for the existence of the alleged absolute Being…”[ii] Thus, the theological
answer appears to be one of convenience that does not fully answer our query;
rather, it stops the inquiry by asking no more why questions.  
  
Edwards differentiates the theological why question—are there gods and do they
provide the ultimate explanation?—from what he calls the “super-ultimate why.”
A person posing this latter question regards the theological answer as not
going far enough because it does not answer questions such as “Why are there
gods at all?” or “Why is there anything at all?” or “Why does everything that
is, exist?” The theological answer simply puts an end to why questions
arbitrarily; it stops short of pushing the question to its ultimate end. One
might respond that it is obsessive to continually ask why questions, but most
reflective persons do ask “Why does anything or everything exist?” suggesting
that the question is basic to thoughtful persons. Of course, it may be that we
just don’t know the answer to this ultimate mystery—all we can say is that the
existence of anything is a mystery, its ultimate explanation remaining always
beyond us.  
  
According to Edwards, while some philosophers take the ultimate why question
seriously many others argue that it is meaningless. The reason for this is
that if a question cannot in principle be answered, as so many philosophers
claim about this super ultimate why question, then that question is
meaningless. Critics of this view agree that the question is radically
different from all others but disagree that it is meaningless. They respond
that ordinarily, questions must in principle be capable of being answered to
be meaningful, but not in the case of this ultimate question. Yet if a
question really cannot be answered, and if all possible answers have been
ruled out a priori, is that not the very definition of a meaningless question?  
  
Another way of arriving at the conclusion that the question “why does
everything exist?” is meaningless, is to consider how when we ordinarily ask
“why x?” we assume the answer is something other than x. But in the case of
“why anything at all?” it is not possible to find something outside of
everything to explain everything. So meaningful why questions are those which
are about anything in the set of all things, but if our why question is about
something other than everything, then why has lost its meaning because it is
logically impossible to have an answer.""  ",3661
"Now, this sort of relationship between _C_ and _E_ is simply not like the
relationship between God and the world as that is understood by classical
theism. God’s creating the world is not a matter of making it the case that
_this_ specific thing happens in the world rather than _that_ specific thing.
Rather, creation is a matter of making it the case that there is _any world at
all_. Moreover, theism holds that the fact that there is any world at all is
something that _could not even in principle_ have obtained in the absence of
divine creative action. For classical theism, if we’re talking about a view
according to which the world _might_ have existed apart from God, but simply
_happens_ not to do so, then we’re not really talking about _theism_ but

this is improbable given the empirical evidence. Or it is as absurd as a
mathematician proposing that there is solid confirming empirical evidence that

"Walter,  
  
Libertarian freedom entails that you can, at the same time, have non-
determining reasons for doing X and non-determining reasons for not-doing-X.
What is the intention, beyond the choosing of one over the other? It is when
you intend (and hence have chosen) to do one instead of the other, and thus
are ready intending the action. If the intention is not the choice, then it
would be the motivation. And in both cases there is no difference between our
case of LFW and God's:  
  
Before I finally make my choice, I have motivations for X and ~X. In w1 I go
on to choose X; in w2 I go on to choose ~X. And yet there is no difference in
my intrinsic properties between w1 and w2.  
  
This is what is weird in LFW, but as explained, it is the same for God as well
as for us. So this is no objection against divine simplicity per se.  
  
But perhaps you think that the ""intention"" is neither the choosing nor the
motivation, but an accompanying mental state that is always present when, and
only when, a choice is made. In that case, the intention would NOT be a
necessary condition for a choice being made. Because if it were, we would
never be able to choose anything, since we would have to choose our intention
before being able to make a choice, and that is circular or regressive. I can,
under motivations for both X and ~X, and with no intention whatsoever (since I
haven't made the choice yet), choose to do X or ~X and thus effectively,
freely bring about X or ~X without this ""intention"" entity/property. So God's
having or not having an intention in this case would be irrelevant for his
power to choose, but it ALSO is the same for us.  
  
But if the the problem is that God must be different when he chooses X as
opposed to ~X, then again this would not work under libertarian freedom for us
as either. Because (again) when you choose between X (in w1) or ~X (in w2),
the cause of your choice has exactly the same intrinsic properties between
worlds. The cause of your choosing X in w1 is you at t in state S; and the
cause of your choosing ~X in w2 is you at t in state S. There is a branching,
and yet there is no difference in intrinsic properties of you at t between
worlds. So, once again: it is the same for us and God, and libertarian freedom
does not require subjects to change in intrinsic properties between worlds in
order to make choices.",2377
"""then why call it ""theistic personalism""?""  
  
We shouldn't. I agree it's a terrible and confusing label. Nowadays people
seem to be preferring to use the term ""neo-theism"", which is much better. It's
neutral, doesn't invite the misunderstanding that it's about personal vs
impersonal, and still drives the point that denial of divine simplicity is
(mostly) a new phenomenon - and in academia, motivated by recent objections in
analytic philosophy against divine simplicity.  
  
So yeah, everyone should just use neo-theism.",526
"God's act of creation is God's very essence. That's why creation is a mistery
we can not fully grasp. But I think we can show that this doctrine is coherent

God has but one act of will - the act by which God wills himself. And God
wills everything in the act of willing himself. This Divine Act is the same in
every possible world. However, just as a point can be considered as the
maximal or the minimum point of different parabolas, or the zero of many
different lines, God's Will can be considered as the source of different
worlds. His act of Will is really the same, but virtually distinct across
possible worlds.  
  
In fact, Saint Thomas says in the Summa contra Gentiles that sometimes a causa
has a non-necessary relation with its effects. During the Middle Ages, of
course, he was not aware of any probabilistic events - intrinsically
probabilistic, I mean, like Quantum Mechanics. But his answer has this deep
insight: a cause may produce its effects, not out of necessity, but randomly
or because of a free choice.  
  
The argument against Divine Simplicity shifts, at this point, towards
intentional directedness. But here I think the argument presupposes an
anthropomorphic conception of Divine Choice. We do not know anything about
God's psychological life. We can not affirm nor deny the possibility of
choosing different things in the same Divine Act.

"""Being infinitely good, would it not go against His nature to choose a lesser
good, as against a better one? Similarly, would it not go against His nature
to to choose not to create, if He knows that the choice to create is better?""  
  
I am also puzzled by this. But since I am not bound by dogma, I am open to
accepting that God creates out of a necessity of his perfect nature. But it'd
be nice if it can be avoided.  
  
So there's a lot to be said about this, and what I'll mention doesn't come
close to covering the whole topic, but I think it's an interesting thought,
and maybe an escape route. Consider: one could deny that perfect goodness MUST
entail always doing the best, if the best is supererogatory. The very notion
of a supererogatory action is that it's a good action you can perform without
being anything like an obligation. We can imagine you can, for instance,
donate 100 dollars to a charity right now, and it would be good and virtuous
of you, but it wouldn't be an obligation. You can fail to do it without
thereby incurring in sin or evil.  
  
I think creation might be a supererogatory good like that. If it's
supererogatory, then God would be very willing to create (or create the best)
without nevertheless *having* to create. So you could say God is somehow
likely to perform supererogatory actions, but not determined (thus preserving
contingency).  
  
I don't think this works for the problem of evil or anything like that (I very
much believe God must, for example, prevent or stop a torture if there is no
greater good to be gained from permitting it), but I think it's a nice enough
candidate to solve the necessitarian issue",1663
"@Talmid  
  
The same way classical theism and contingent knowledge go together. My open
theism is based on the openness of the future (I agree with Pruss and many
others that foreknowledge of free acts requires eternalism, but I am a
presentist, so I reject foreknowledge of free acts). In other words: there is
no difference at all in our views of God - I also believe that he must know
every true fact. The difference between us is that I do not believe there are
any true facts of what we will choose. Only what we choose or have chosen. So
there is nothing for God to know there.  
  
How can God ""learn"" what we choose without undergoing intrinsic change? The
same way God can learn any contingent facts without undergoing intrinsic
change. Classical theists believe God's knowledge of contingents is
externalist and involves only Cambridge changes for him. You already have to
believe that God's knowledge differs between worlds without that entailing any
change in his intrinsic properties. Even with foreknowledge you have to
believe that God only knows what you will do IFF God contingently creates you
(unless you are a Molinist - which thomists reject - or you believe God
creates of necessity). So you're on the same boat as me when it comes to
having to account for God's contingent knowledge without real change. The only
difference, again, is that I think there is nothing to know re: ""future
choices"".  
  
So no, open theism does not entail God being temporal. I wholeheartedly agree
that God is outside of time. But unlike what some (very confused) thomists
think, that does not mean that God can ""see the future"" as if there were
anything to see there (unless, again, you are an eternalist/B theorist).",1722

OK, here is a bit more:  
  
I avoid using phrases or concepts like ""all possible worlds"" as confusing or

how can our human minds encompass all possibility, especially if we admit that
God must know more about what is possible than we can. I don't mean to claim

useful. I just like to avoid it when possible, and so I favor ""all imaginable

not the ""imagination"" of God, angels, people experiencing the beatific vision,
etc. Just people like you and me. It greatly simplifies discussion and
simplicity is what we are looking for.  
  
I make a further simplification by saying that our ideas about all imaginable
worlds must be communicable to other ordinary people. If it can't be
communicated there is not much use in having the idea. It won't get anywhere.  
  
This entails a further restriction, and that is that the communication must be
verbal - in words that other people can understand. This could be widened
somewhat. For example, ideas could be communicated by images, non verbal
sounds, moving imagery, with or without sound, etc. But I hope you do not
object to my just restricting it to words alone, again for simplicity. I
believe that whatever can be said about communication by words alone can be
extended to these other forms of communication.

with the status of the multiplicity of divine ideas (""and 2 must be different
from 5!""). That is a different problem. Speaking for myself it's not clear to
me that divine ideas must literally exist as separate entities; the nature of
knowledge and how (it seems to me) it's basically a ""transparent"" power
whereby something is grasped by the knower and understood through itself seems
to me compatible with God knowing different abstract facts by means of a
single known concrete substance which is analyzed (a substance that happens to
be the ground of all possibilia anyway, God), though I cannot hope to imagine
it. I think what Dolezal has written on the divine ideas would also be very
helpful here.  
  
Thus God's personhood is grounded in impersonal notions like ""being"" and
""act"": for Thomists, these are what God is, primarily""  
  
This misses the point. The point at that stage is precisely that ""being"" and
""act"" are NOT impersonal. Intelligence is an irreducible aspect of existence
which some beings (like us) enjoy when they're not limited enough. God's
personhood is not grounded in anything impersonal (that would be absurd);
existence in its fullness is taken to be irreducibly personal. It's impersonal
beings that just happen to be limited enough that they are unable to possess
that dimension of being, so to speak. As the ultimate source of personhood and
the unlimited actuality of the principle that is the basis of personhood, God
is personal through and through.

anything distinct from him, so that nothing in his nature can compel him to

I don't see how that works.  
  
1- if it's being argued that the act is free simply because it isn't being
compelled by anything external to God, nevertheless it could still be
compelled by God's nature - that is, what is internal to God, not external. If
this is free, it is not *libertarian* free however, and entails that creation
is necessary: necessitated by God's nature;  
  
2- if it is argued that there is nothing internal to God that could compel
him, because he is pure actuality, it's not clear that the argument works. For
all we know, an internal necessity need not be construed as some kind of
""lack"", in the sense that ""humans need food to survive"". God didn't need
creation to not be lonely or any other nonsense. But it could be a ""need"" in
the sense of a necessary manifestation of the divine nature/goodness. Just
like how it's true that ""God needs to not create a world of horrendous
pointless torture"" (it is necessary from his nature), it could be that God's
nature compels him to create - as, for example, Leibniz believed (leibnizian
optimism); the neoplatonists believed (emanation); or Pseudo-Dionysius
(perhaps) believed - that it is the nature of the Good to be self-diffusive.

"A rather lively discussion concerning LFW which has long been lacking with
respect to divine freedom (and to a more indirect extent, modal collapse).  
  
@RunDec @Walter  
  
As far as I can tell, there has been a hidden assumption about event causation
here: namely ""choose x"" is some event then leading to ""x occurs"". That is
completely wrong, in that it would destroy the unity of an action and would
lead to a vicious regress regarding volition. Rather ""choose x"" and ""x occurs""
is a simultaneous causal relationship of an action of a volitional agent.  
  
A better description of LFW here (in its most bare bones form as self-
generated action; deliberation is a type of it) is not so much in weighing
scales, but something like picking a point on a circle: namely, insofar as the
formula of a circle only provides an undifferentiated sea of possibles but no
actual ones, I have to actualize some particular point, and prior to that
actualization, the point is just a mere possible, not something with an
individual actual reality; it cannot even be considered of itself a true
individual reality apart from my actualization.  
  
You could say that relies on a dubious notion of an infinity of options, but
the basic idea does not change even for finite options. Suppose I have C = {X,
Y}. C taken of itself is just an undifferentiated sea of possibles, to get X I
would need C[0] while for Y I would need C[1]. That caused ""indexing"" is just
what a self-determined action is. Since that ""indexing"" is not prior to the
action but simultaneous with it, it is self-determined and free; nor is it
some random ""coin flip"" because the 0ing and 1ing are not some earlier
floating states (which would also generate a vicious regress as above) but
coincident with the volition itself. In fact, it is more accurate to describe
""0ing"" and ""1ing"" as descriptions of self-determinations, not as ""things"".  
  
The major issue I see being made here is regarding a volitional act as
something like picking from already existent states competing for dominance.",2053

have done other than what he has in fact done, doesn’t that entail that God is
changeable, contrary to divine simplicity? And if he is in fact unchangeable
or immutable, doesn’t that entail that he could not have done otherwise, and
thus created of necessity rather than freely? In response, Davies points out,
first, that creating _freely_ simply does not in fact entail _changing_.
Certainly it simply begs the question to assume otherwise. For the classical

atemporal does not undergo change. Still, he could have done otherwise than
create, so that this eternal act of creation is free.",1084

""The whole point of LFW is that the will is not determined. LFW does not mean
you can have no will that determines your choice.

argument goes through.  
If you will vanilla ice (for whatever reason), then, unless something happens
to prevent this choice you have vanilla ice and not chocolate ice.""  
  
How on earth can I choose what to eat, then? The picture you described is
literally my will - completely outside of my control - determining my choice
to either get vanilla or chocolate depending on some property arising in it -
and you suggest that the causal origin of that property is irrelevant for
whether we are libertarian free or not! That it doesn't matter where it came
from. So in your model I can - with no control over it, no choice over it -
just get a ""will"" to have vanilla ice and this will make me get vanilla ice
instead of chocolate (unless something happens to prevent it, again something
over which I presumably have no control over since all my actions would just
follow upon another will arising, and it wouldn't matter where that will came
from, according to you).  
In what world is that libertarian freedom? That is just people being
determined by a will over which they have no control. I don't think any LFW
proponent would agree with that model; certainly I think most LFW theorists
would agree with me. And then you just refuse to elaborate on the potential
regress of the origins of the ""will"" and how, in your model, it cannot arise
by the choice of the agent (since you must refuse that A at t in S can cause
either X or ~X).  
I am surprised that you think this would count as LFW.  
  
I take it as essential that in LFW *we* are the ones making our choices, in an
indeterministic but non-stochastic way; that we cause our actions and do so in
such a way that, when we're deliberating, we can really cause one or the other
at that moment, and thus under the same set of intrinsic properties.  
  
I say we can reach an agreement and a common conclusion here: you and I have
radically different ideas of LFW. So if someone accepts your model, then
indeed they will have a problem with God's choice in DS. If someone subscribes
to your model of LFW, then that objection to DS is a serious one, and perhaps
there is no way around it.  
  
But if someone accepts my model of LFW (or, even more modestly, accepts my
model as metaphysically possible) instead, then the problem disappears.
Because in my model, the agent can cause either X or ~X without requiring a
difference in intrinsic properties for choosing one or the other. It's not
unique to God, it's the same for humans, too.  
  
So if someone accepts your model of libertarian freedom (call it LFW1) then
the objection is very much alive. Well done. But if someone prefers my model
(call it LFW2) instead, the objection isn't really impressive. I think that's
fair.",2949

""Of course there is a difference in my intrinsic properties between w1 and w2.
Otherwise there is no reason why I choose X over ~X.  
The cause of my choosing X in w1 is me with my intention to choose X, which is
an intrinsic property.  
You are describing a random process instead of a choice.""  
  
No, Walter, there is no intrinsic difference if LFW is true, and this is
precisely how there can be a libertarian free choice. Otherwise the presence
of you + the intention would determine the resulting action and we would no
longer have libertarian freedom. If the cause were you and the intention, then
in order to preserve libertarian freedom you would have to cause your
intention. But then to cause your intention you would end up in an infinite
regress, unless you accept that you at t in state S can cause Intention (what
it does in w1) or not cause it (what it does in w2). In other words: there is
no difference in intrinsic properties in the agent in worlds 1 and 2, and yet
the agent can cause X or ~X. See? That's my point.  
  
There is literally no difference between humans and God when it comes to this
weird aspect of libertarian freedom. For determinism to be avoided, it must be
the case that someone at t in state S can cause both X or ~X. For our
libertarian choice of X, there is a time t which is the earliest time with the
property that after t it is no longer causally possible for us to choose ~X
instead. How else do you think libertarian freedom could work, without
determinism? If the choice follows a difference in intrinsic properties, then
the choice would be determined by such a difference and thus would no longer
be libertarian, lest we cause the difference in properties (the intention,
say), but then the same problem would reappear.  
  
You say that this is ""random"". That is a common accusation by those who
*reject* libertarian freedom. I do not accept that it is random; I believe
libertarian choice is a sui generis category that is neither random nor
deterministic, but that is beside the point. My response was that the
""problem"" Vincent was pointing out doesn't just affect Divine Simplicity, but
also libertarian freedom for humans. It is THE SAME THING for us. The issue
there doesn't lie with classical theism, but LFW; LFW by itself requires that
an agent can be able to (non-randomly) bring about different effects without
there being any change in the intrinsic properties of the agent when it is
choosing.  
  
So if you have a problem with God choosing to cause different things without
requiring any difference in intrinsic properties as a condition for that, you
should also have a problem with libertarian freedom for humans. Which you
probably do (you probably do not accept LFW). Vincent however does presumably
accept LFW, so he has to choose between rejecting LFW altogether or dropping
that objection.  
  
The only difference between us and God in this case is you could argue that
our intrinsic properties change *after* we have CHOSEN (not when we are
choosING). But so what? It is not even clear to me that we must change
intrinsically after we have chosen; why insist that this must happen
universally, even with God? It would still be the case that for a libertarian
free choice to be made, the cause need not incur in change, since the cause
can indeed, under the same exact intrinsic properties, bring about different
effects. So the objection against God's choosing is worthless.  
  
One could go on to complain about God's contingent knowledge of what he in
fact chose (again, a matter of what could change AFTER a choice), but that is
a different objection - the one that pertains to God's contingent knowledge.

We use the same logic, the logic that God gave us. It is sufficient to
understand some truths about God because God intended us to use our logic to
understand these truths, but our logic is not sufficient to understand
everything about God as that is unlimited and infinite (as the integers are
infinite in number yet are limited by not being all ratios or fractions).  
  
We can make progress towards infinity in the same way that 8 is closer to a
completed infinity than 6 (I am not speaking of my infinite sequence here,
just making a numerical metaphor). While 8 is close to infinity in the

completed infinity. I can correct your ideas because I am beyond them. I have

Tom Cohoe  ",1464
"Hi Ed,  
  
I respectfully put it to you that the Thomistic doctrine of Divine simplicity
you're defending here has passed its use-by date, for the following reasons:  
  
1\. It isn't taught by the Church, which merely affirms that God has “one
essence, substance, or nature absolutely simple” (Lateran IV, 1215). There's
nothing here about whether God has contingent thoughts, plans or intentions in
his capacity as Creator of the cosmos, in addition to possessing a nature
which is necessary.  
  
2\. It's totally unscriptural. The Bible depicts God as explicitly declaring,
""My thoughts [plural] are not your thoughts"" (Isaiah 55:8), in a verse
affirming Divine transcendence (which is the last place where one would expect
anthropomorphic language, so I can only assume it's literal). The Psalmist
adds: ""How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How vast is the sum
of them!"" (Psalm 139:17). Thomists, on the other hand, believe that God does
not have multiple thoughts; instead, He has only one thought, viz., His
thought of Himself, and He knows creatures by knowing Himself.  
  
3\. It's grounded in a philosophically dubious ontology: creatures are said to
be compounds of essence and existence, while God alone is an Act of Pure and
Infinite Existence, which is incapable of possessing any modifications or
attributes (such as thoughts and intentions). However, the arguments for a
real distinction between essence and existence in creatures prove no such
thing: all they prove is that matter and form are distinct (which is why I can
know what a Thylacine [or Tasmanian tiger] is, without knowing whether it
currently exists or not: I don't know for sure if its form is still
instantiated anywhere on Earth). What's more, the notion of Pure Existence is
utterly vague: it is indefinite rather than infinite. Better to say, rather,
that God is the Ultimate Yardstick of existence. He defines what it means for
us to exist, for ""in him we live, and move, and have our being"" (Acts 17:28).  
  
4\. Thomists also contend that God, the Author of nature, could have made a
different world, or no world at all, without having any different mental acts,
such as intentions. That's like an author saying, “I could have written a
totally different story, or even no story at all, without there being any
difference in my intentions.”  
  
5\. Why is there a world? The Thomist’s answer is: “Because God.” But if there
were a different world, or no world at all, the Thomist's reply would be the
same: ""Because God."" I respectfully submit that any explanation which is
elastic enough to account for BOTH the world’s occurrence AND its non-
occurrence is not doing the work of an explanation at all. It's vacuous.  
  
6\. Finally, if there's one thing Scripture is quite clear about, it is that
God is a Father. And as the doctrine of the Trinity shows, even without
creating anything, He'd still be one. That's a basic fact about God, and it
shows He's personal all the way down.",2992
"Hi everyone,  
  
Thanks you all for your responses.  
  
Talmid, you write: ""Either it [Pure Existence] is infinite or it is finite.
But if PE was finite them it would be a certain form of existence and so not
PE, which is contradictory, so PE has to be infinite.""  
  
What your argument really proves is that the notion of ""pure existence"" is
utterly amorphous: it is not tied to any particular form. But by the same
token, since it has no form, we cannot say that it is positively infinite,
either; all we can say is that it has no positive characteristics at all.  
  
RunDec, you object to my assertion that the alleged distinction between a
thing's essence and its existence can be explained in terms of the form-matter
distinction, by arguing as follows: ""the existence of an animal might require
its material exemplification, but this is not the case with immaterial beings
(such as souls, angels, God, or any other candidates).""  
  
Re separated souls: at least we can say that they once had bodies and that
they will one day have them back, so we can regard them as being ""branded,"" so
to speak, by the matter they informed. Re angels: I'm sure you're well aware
that there were many medieval philosophers who held that angels are not pure
forms, but possess a kind of spiritual matter, allowing two or more angels to
be of the same species. As for God, His essence and existence are commonly
held to be identical, anyway.  
  
You also ask, ""if God had an accident distinct from himself (his essence),
where would this accident come from? It can't come from the essence lest you
accept the precedence of a perfectly simple Essence which is the source of all
things, which is what you're trying to avoid.""  
  
I'm quite happy to say that God's essence is simple. What I insist is that
God's Mind or Essence has multiple thoughts and intentions which are
contingent accidents - e.g. God's concept of this universe, and His intention
to make it.  
  
You deny that having an intention is a necessary condition for making a choice
because ""if it were, we would never be able to choose anything, since we would
have to choose our intention before being able to make a choice, and that is
circular or regressive."" However, your argument misconstrues my position,
which is that an agent's choice to do something must be (at least logically,
even if not temporally) preceded by a plan or intention to do it. Otherwise,
it would be impossible to attribute an action A to spiritual agent X rather
than spiritual agent Y, as neither of them would have done anything to
identify it as the cause of A. But although I produce things (or states of
affairs) as an agent, I do not ""produce"" my intentions; I just have them. They
are voluntary, but not in the same sense that my actions are. My intentions
have no prior cause; I just have them, and that's all. So too with God.  
  
I don't have any problem with an agent either choosing to bring about X or
choosing not to bring about X, and having an identical causal history in both
cases. What bothers me is the notion of an agent acting without a plan. That
just makes no sense. Cheers.  
  
William,  
  
While Ed doesn't deny that God is personal, He construes God's personhood in
terms of His possessing an intellect (and will), which in turn is construed in
terms of God being Pure Act and containing (eminently) every form which He
generates, within Himself, since He is Pure Being. Thus God's personhood is
grounded in impersonal notions like ""being"" and ""act"": for Thomists, these are
what God is, primarily. I maintain that God has thoughts of His own, which are
in some sort of Divine language, and these thoughts are what makes God
personal.

Francesca Stavrakopoulou's ""God: An Anatomy."" It will change the way he thinks
about the God of the Bible. Cheers.

It can easily be shown that when a third sequence, C, is created by doing the
operation A XOR B -> C, that C is as random as A and is as unlikely as A to
display as anything meaningful.  
  
Now, the beginning of a system:  
  
It can also easily be shown that A, B, and C, together, have the property such
that any two of them produce the third sequence when the bitwise XOR operation
is performed on the other two. Thus:  
  
A XOR B -> C,  
B XOR C -> A, and  
C XOR A -> B.  
  
As stated above as easily demonstrated, if A is random, then so is C. But we
began with a random A and then chose B to be intelligible, so if we XOR the
two random sequences (""disordered"" is a better word here than ""random"", but
for now I stick with ""random""), we get the intelligible sequence that we
purposely chose. Now here is the crux of the beginning of the system:  
  
The random sequence A that we began with cannot, by itself, give us the chosen
sequence B. A is random after all. It could have been any similarly random
sequence, so if any random sequence could be decoded into the chosen sequence,
how could it be decoded into a different chosen sequence had a different one
been chosen? If there was some process dependent upon the chosen sequence by
which any random sequence could be decoded into the particular chosen
sequence, then the chosen sequence would already have to be known before the
correct process that works could be used. So the random sequence A cannot
have, intrinsic to itself, the information thatispecifies the chosen sequence.
Furthermore, since the second random sequence was produced using the XOR
operation with the chosen sequence and the chosen sequence could have been
_any_ intelligible sequence, we have that a second random sequence C exists
for any initial random A and chosen B. For random A there exists a random C
that gives B, the intelligible sequence, no matter what intelligible sequence
Biwas chosen.  
  
By just guessing at what C happens to be, A XOR C is most likely nonsense, but
if it results in an intelligible B, it is very unlikely to be the pre-chosen
B. It is in fact as likely as correctly guessing the pre-chosen B from all
possible intelligible sequences (this is slightly simplified for clarity).  
  
This is the beginning of a system based on simplicity that will show that God
does not have to be ruled by the logic that you, Walter, futilely use to try
to impose your own ideas as limits on God.  
  
You are seeing a challenge from me.

act of creation would be unfree, one would have to show that there is
something either internal to God’s nature or external to him that compels him
to create. But given that the divine nature is as classical theists, on
independent grounds, argue it to be (pure actuality, perfect, omnipotent,
etc.) there can be no need in God for anything distinct from him, so that
nothing in his nature can compel him to create. And since, the classical
theist also argues (and again on independent grounds) there is nothing apart
from God that God did not create, there can be nothing distinct from him that
compels him to create. Hence we cannot make sense of God’s being in any way
compelled to create, and thus must attribute freedom to him.",811

I myself struggled with that question for quite some time. For a while I held
that God couldn't know the future because the future is not, and the act of

get to it) involves distinguishing between absolute necessity (i.e. it follows
from the nature of the thing) and conditional necessity (which is brought
about by a specific set of circumstances) and having a proper understanding of
God's eternal knowledge (not foreknowledge) as a presentialist view, wherein
God sees all things which are (for us) past, present, and future all as the
present and immediately available. This knowledge of what presently is does
not necessarily preclude the rational agent from choosing to do otherwise in
that moment other than what he or she was already doing, i.e. it is
conditionally necessary and not absolutely necessary.

"As a Catholic who accepts classical theism and divine simplicity, this topic
of freedom vs. necessity of creation is one that I struggle with.  
  
God's decision to create or not to create does not end with that binary
choice; rather the choice to create involves the further choice of WHAT to
create, out of an infinite number of possibilities.  
  
Good, being omniscient, would know what all these possible creations are, and
also know which ones are better, which less good, and which one is best of
all.  
  
Being infinitely good, would it not go against His nature to choose a lesser
good, as against a better one? Similarly, would it not go against His nature
to to choose not to create, if He knows that the choice to create is better?  
  
Does this all come down more to definitions than substance? Perhaps the
meaning of ""freedom"" in the context of the Divinity is something that our
human minds can't quite grasp? Do freedom, necessity, and goodness in some

An agent has a range of actions that can be actualized for some given scenario
(which provides the common intelligibility for the range of these actions).
Since the range considered in itself is indeterminate (and the scenario is
indifferent towards any one such action) the agent particularizes out of that
range to get an actual action. The particularization itself is sui generis and
only exists with some volition itself.  
  
To answer your question more directly, action A and action B are analogous to
each other with respect to the scenario in question. If the scenario is for
instance that one needs to survive, then the actions ""drink water"" and ""eat
food"" can both be said to ensure survival, but in different ways. Since
neither of these has commanding power until they are realized, the agent is
really open to both.  
  
As such, if you were somehow able to run simulations of this, you would see
the agent sometimes ""drink water"", other times ""eat food"".

different actions with no intrinsic difference across the agent (until after
the action is done). Moreover, ""X"" and ""Y"" do not have any actual individual

RunDec's arguments have been quite right.) I would suggest that RunDec might
better have stated his position as something like the following:

'because,' _because_ it was _his_ (free) act of creation -- which he
(necessarily!) saw/knew in _all_ of its aspects: in itself, in its

creator); and his seeing that it was good is not a contingent fact, but a
necessary one. God sees that every possibly creatable world would be good.""

whatsoever.  
  
Finally, if divine simplicity, divine freedom, and the relationship between
them are to be properly understood as characterizations of what God is not,
then ""being free and yet simple and necessary and whatever"" is also to be
understood as a characterization of what God is not.",719
" _""In response, Davies points out, first, that creating freely simply does not
in fact entail changing. Certainly it simply begs the question to assume
otherwise. For the classical theist, God creates eternally or atemporally, and
what is eternal or atemporal does not undergo change. Still, he could have
done otherwise than create, so that this eternal act of creation is free._  
How doesn't _Davies_ beg the question here?  
What Davies is saying here is that creating freely doesn't entail changing
because god doesn't change and yet creates freely. Davies is already assuming
that god can create freely, which is what he is supposed to show is possible
if God is unchanging.

The thing that is internal to Him that ""compels"" Him to create is His nature.
It is the same thing that""compels"" God not to lie.  
  
Davies' third objection actually shows the exact opposite of what he is trying
to claim.  
If God doesn't use a process of ""figuring out"", that means that His will of
creation is eternally present. If God does not have properties that are
distinct from each other or from him, then this will of creation is identical
to God. And that, again, would be what ""compells"" him to create.

An intelligible verbal communication can exist on a computer as a sequence of

computer this way. There is an absolute difference between an infinite
sequence and a finite sequence here. Now no matter what the intelligible
communication, it must exist throughout the infinite bitwise random sequence
as a subsequence, normally distributed (from Wikipedia ""Normal Number"" on an
infinite sequence of ""coin tosses"" : ""If a number is normal, no finite
combination of digits of a given length occurs more frequently than any other
combination of the same length"").  
  
Yet in searching for the specific intelligible verbal subsequence described
earlier it is impossible to know, if it is not found, that the infinite
sequence is biased - is not normal, for the search could encompass a length of
the infinite sequence that just does not contain the verbal subsequence. For
example the sequence 01 should appear in 25% of the 2 bit subsequences, but if
the sequence consisting of a million 1's in a row is where you happen to look
for 01, you will not find 01 normally distributed in the million 1's. Such
lengths missing the verbal subsequence must also appear in the infinite
sequence, and they must also be normally distributed if the infinite sequence
is normal, which it must be if it is bitwise 50/50 random.

verbally communicated and yet no matter how much of it is human examined

with immaterial beings (such as souls, angels, God, or any other candidates).
What you are pointing to is precisely the difference between Essence and
Existence - that you can know what-a-thing-is without knowing that-a-thing-is.
It's not the same as what form a thing has versus its material cause (which
also could or could not exist). I don't know what you mean by ""Pure Existence""
being vague or not infinite but Aquinas has some pretty good arguments for why
Pure Existence is infinite, divine, etc.  
  
More importantly, why are you ignoring the entire rationale for Divine
Simplicity? It seems to be a recurring thing among critics. You point apparent
problems but then ignore the arguments given for simplicity.  
  
I speak as a person who has no ulterior motives; I simply am convinced that
the First Cause of all things must be absolutely simple. If it had parts, then
it would be dependent upon those parts for its existence, and thus would not
be perfectly independent. Yet cosmological arguments require a foundation that
is entirely independent of anything, which just is necessary existence,
unconditioned. A composite is always conditioned by its parts, its existence
is always ""iffy"" and dependent on the parts. So if ""God"" had parts, the parts
would be the First Principles, not the composite. And if you follow that
along, you'll reach some really bad problems.  
And if God had an accident distinct of himself (his essence), where would this
accident come from? It can't come from the essence lest you accept the
precedence of a perfectly simple Essence which is the source of all things,
which is what you're trying to avoid. But there is nowhere for the accident to
come from, then, and being an accident, it cannot exist ""by its own (non-
substantial, hence conditioned and dependent) nature"". You know classical
authors reflected a lot on these matters and didn't just adopt Divine
Simplicity because of church teaching, right?  
  
4- And yet the same happens with libertarian freedom for us as well. Before
you make your choice, there is a point in which there is no difference in your
properties between world 1 (where you go on to choose X) and world 2 (where
you go on to not choose X). So do you reject libertarian free will for humans
too? Since I accept LFW, I already cannot accept that objection.  
  
If I had to accept it, though, I would rather embrace necessitarian
emanationism or optimism etc. than reject Simplicity, speaking for myself.  
  
5- This objection wouldn't just cut against Divine Simplicity; it would also
cut against creation being the result of a free choice, given what I said in
4. And you seem to be presupposing that an explanans must determine the
explanandum, which is very doubtful (especially if it would cost us standard
free will explanations);  
  
6- Again, don't care about what Scripture says in philosophical matters
(philosophy and rational argument always comes first to me) but Divine
Simplicity isn't incompatible with God being personal. God *is* personal, and
literally so, since he is the ultimate source of personhood. He's just
eminently personal by virtue of a greater perfection (a single one) which
includes the actualities of all others in a unified way.",3680

Yes; Aquinas, who regards the intellect as a free power, calls this 'free
decision', and it's part of his account of free will -- human freedom in the
full sense includes free decision in the intellect and free choice in the
will, and what we call 'free will' is often the interplay between the
intellect and the will as free powers. On Aquinas's view, the intellect can
freely infer (suspend judgment, etc.) in matters that do not involve necessary
truths, and so it can likewise select without necessitation non-necessary
goods to consider, and thereby sometimes influence the options available to
the will's free choice, not by determining the will, but by shifting the non-
necessary goods among which the will chooses.",739
"Third, Davies notes that those who suppose that freedom in God would entail
changeability often presuppose an anthropomorphic conception of divine choice.
In particular, they imagine it involving a temporal process of weighing
alternative courses of action before finally deciding upon one of them. But
that is not what God is like, given that he is eternal or outside time, and
that he is omniscient and doesn’t have to “figure things out” through some
kind of reasoning process.",480
"Finally, Davies emphasizes that “to speak of God as simple is not to attribute
a property to God but to deny certain things when it comes to God” (p. 179).
Here, as he has in other work, Davies emphasizes the idea that the ascription
of attributes to God should be understood as an exercise in _negative_ or
_apophatic_ theology. The main arguments for classical theism, he points out,
emphasize both that the world is contingent or conditioned in various
respects, and that an ultimate explanation of the world must be _un_
conditioned and _non_ -contingent in those respects. (Though, just in case he
wouldn’t himself use it, I should note that the language of “conditioned” and
“unconditioned” in this context is mine, not Davies’.) In particular, God must
_not_ be changeable, must _not_ have properties that are distinct from each
other or from him, and so on. This is what it means to characterize him as
simple. But by the same token, he must _not_ be compelled to create by
anything either internal to his nature or outside of him. Hence divine
simplicity, divine freedom, and the relationship between them are properly
understood as characterizations of what God is _not_.",1181
"Vincent,  
  
You mention souls having to be branded by their bodies - nevertheless, once
the soul loses the body, it CONTINUES TO EXIST. Which would be sufficient to
refute the idea that existence is the same as material exemplifications. That
seems obvious to me. If you wanna say things exist because they have matter,
you cannot say that a disembodied soul can exist or continue to exist; at most
you can say that such a soul has existed before, but no longer exists, if it
no longer has matter.  
Saying angels also have prime matter is okay but that'd just be another cost
for a position that seems implausible and frankly doesn't seem to accomplish
much.  
  
""As for God, His essence and existence are commonly held to be identical,
anyway.""  
  
But God is not material. So it just seems bizarre to suggest that existence
comes from prime matter.  
  
And overall, I cannot quite make sense of what you are suggesting except if we
are just calling ""Existence"" ""Matter"". In that case, the form will be the
Essence and Matter will be ""Existence"" and you have only a semantic
difference.  
  
The whole point of the Essence x Existence distinction, in a nutshell, is that
there is a real actuality that is the ""oomph"" of things existing. When you
consider a unicorn, you can understand what it is without knowing whether it
actually exists or not. This is so because its existence is not the same as
its essence. Sure, the unicorn's existence qua unicorn involves material
exemplification, but there might be things which exist without matter (as the
examples I gave), and in any case we are just trying to maintain a principle
of actuality/reality here. You seem to just be turning that principle into
matter. One could make more objections from the nature of prime matter and how
it can be changed etc., but it's not even clear to me what you're trying to
accomplish with that, and how you would avoid the arguments for a real
distinction (if you really are trying to abandon it).  
  
""What I insist is that God's Mind or Essence has multiple thoughts and
intentions which are contingent accidents - e.g. God's concept of this
universe, and His intention to make it.""  
  
But where do these accidents come from? They could only be caused by the
divine essence, but then God would just be the simple essence anyway. And it
seems impossible for the accidents to come about, since they would have to
actualize God somehow (in the way accidents actualize the subjects), but God
as pure actuality (the simple essence as you admitted) would not be able to be
actualized by accidents. To put it differently: I worry that God could only
cause himself parts if he already had parts in the first place (a potential to
receive the actuality of the accidents/be modified by the accidents), so it
would be viciously circular.  
Another worry I have is that the First Cause would already prepossess in
itself the actualities of the accidents it would cause, but then, what's the
point? And it would be the case of a something actualizing itself, which is
impossible.  
  
""an agent's choice to do something must be (at least logically, even if not
temporally) preceded by a plan or intention to do it. ""  
  
If intentions do not determine the choice, then it seems you are treating
intentions as if they were non-determining motives or predispositions. But
then the classical theist can agree that God DOES have these intentions. I
certainly believe that, at least. To me, God created this universe because he
was impressed by reasons R, and his being impressed by reasons R is not a
contingent fact, but a necessary one. God is impressed by R in every world.  
  
So what's the issue? Classical theists need not deny that God has intentions
to act. If you accept the fact that God can create different things in
different worlds without there having to be any differences in intrinsic
properties in God between these worlds as he chooses what to create (something
you should accept if you accept LFW) then what is the problem? (1/2)",4030

""speaking of free will, it disturbs me greatly that traditional Catholic
theology has not considered animal abuse to be a deadly sin like Lust or
Gluttony. That goes very contrary to religions like Judaism or Buddhism.""  
  
First, note of pre-Christian Judaism that it certainly permitted the use of
animals  
for human needs, including for rites of sacrifice. Christianity does not
include the use of animals for sacrifice so from your point of view that is an
improvement.  
  
Second, note that Jesus said:  
  
""Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come
to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth
pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be
fulfilled."" (Matthew 5:17-20 KJV)  
  
But much of what is specifically listed as law in pre-Christian Judaism is
subsumed in Christianity as Love rather than being specifically listed, so
while abuse of animals is not listed, it is an act of hatred against what God
loves, which includes all of Creation. Now we have been given all of material
Creation for our proper and needful use, but an act of hatred against anything
is a turning from God and is a mortal or deadly sin as Christians always
understood.  
  
So at no time did Christianity embrace the evil treatment of animals. It would
have always been recognized as hate. But as in many other things, a formal
doctrine against the mistreatment of animals was later worked out from these
foundational principles of Christianity. It certainly is explicit now. See,
for example, the Catechism as promulgated by Pope John Paul II.  
  
Buddhism is not a development of Christianity or Judaism. Therefore, its rites
and rules, while based on partial truth, are not held wholly correct. We
cannot properly be directed by Bhuddhist doctrine.

Given that, as I understand it, to qualify as a classical theist, a thinker
has to, principally, adhere to divine simplicity, I readily concede that this
is compatible with a necessitarian view, and that of many thinkers classified
as such. This compatibility, however, obviously does not entail its truth. Fr.
Davies seems to concern himself with rebutting the claim that divine
simplicity entails it, and to achieve this he doesn’t need to positively prove
the account he happens to think is the true classical theist account, namely,
presumably that of St. Thomas. After all, it’s not like classical theism is a
concrete comprehensive philosophical doctrine or “system” as opposed to a
(contingently useful) classification abstracting from the all-important
theoretical peculiarities.  
  
Now, in light of your reference to pure act, I assumed that it is this account
that you had in mind, and I submit that, I find, the way the pure act argument
works is straightforward, really: agents act for an end, and where there is no
necessary relation between the means and an end, there is no necessity.
Because, on the one hand, God is pure act, something per se perfect, and is
the only possible end for His acts, and creatures fail to contribute anything
to His perfection, on the other, God cannot be said to will the creatures
necessarily. See e.g. Ia q. 19 a. 3.

determinately lead to vanilla rather than chocolate, we must be the ones to
cause such a Will. Otherwise, again, we are in no control whatsoever of our
actions - a Will just emerges (uncaused by us, hence beyond our choice or
control) which then causes our actions. Of course it matters for your
argument, since if your model is unacceptable for libertarian freedom

for-X just emerges beyond our control and determines that we do X, and this is
no libertarian freedom.  
  
But if we cause the Will-to-X we cannot require a further, second order Will-
to-will-to-X, otherwise we end up in a regress. That's been my point for a

choices. It's a confused notion that would lead to an infinite, vicious

that it exists we must be able to choose and cause it (or the Will-to-not-X)

the views is that theistic personalists reject divine simplicity and, as a
consequence, often reject other classical attributes such as immutability,
impassibility, and eternity. (Davies acknowledges that not all those he labels
“theistic personalists” agree on every important issue and that they don’t
necessarily self-identify as theistic personalists. But he’s identifying a
trend of thinking that really does exist in contemporary philosophy of
religion, even if those contributing to it do not always realize they are

"Vincent writes: ""an agent's choice to do something must be (at least
logically, even if not temporally) preceded by a plan or intention to do it.
... My intentions have no prior cause; I just have them, and that's all. So
too with God.""  
  
Gratuitously asserted...?  
  
And God said, ""Let there be..."" But, per Vincent, first, 'logically' speaking,
he formed (quite _un_ intentionally, apparently!) a prior intention/plan that
he would say ""Let there be..."" -- and to be clear, he didn't need to form a
_prior_ prior intention (a second-order prior intention) in order form the
aforementioned prior intention, because 'logically' (Vincent says) one must
form intentions _before acting_ ; and so clearly forming an intention/making a
plan is not itself an action; otherwise one would always have to form
an(other) intention before forming any intention, so that it would be
impossible to ever get started forming an intention/making a plan.  
  
So the question remains, if forming an intention/making a plan is not an
action (as it can't be on Vincent's account), then what is it?  
  
Vincent again: ""I maintain that God has thoughts of His own, which are in some
sort of Divine language, and these thoughts are what makes God personal.""  
  
It's not at all clear what the point here is, but why not instead the
converse: God's thoughts are what make _us_ personal? Vincent seems to think
that God's knowing us by knowing himself puts us somehow 'outside' of God's
knowledge (not to mention love, care, etc.?) -- as if it must really be
himself he knows, not us, not 'personally.' (A queer view, it must be said.)
But it seems clear that the truth is the opposite: God's knowing us by knowing
himself implies that we are necessarily, really, personally inside God's

I know that in was in the books since the beginning, but that has been my
point all along. From the beginning, contrary to what Ed claims, suffering was
a problem and hence, from the beginning, there was a a need for theodicies.  
God may be good in only an analogous way, but an analogy has something in
common with what it is compared to, and your definition of goodness is
contrary to what is generally understood by goodness. What is more important
is that I think you are a good person and that in everyday life you use the
same definition of goodness that I do.  
And on that definition of goodness, every possibilty of evil would be ruled
out if that were possible. But yiurb definition of god's goodness is simply
circular ""Good is what God does and whatever god does is good"".  
  
It is indeed so that the Christian good is not all good in any meaningful
sense, not just not in the sense that we are but in no sense at all.  
Using people and their suffering as a means to get a more attractive creation
is not good in any meaningful sense. It is, in every meaingful sense,
appalling.

“ No, suffering is not a necessary part of our creation unless your claim is
that the fall was necessary.  
The point of the Fall is that man and not God is responsible for the Fall, but
nobody can be responsible for a necessary truth. that would be like saying you
are responsible for why 1 + 1 = 2.”  
  
Again, I think this is treating spiritual truth a bit like Newton’s laws of
motion. The fall is a spiritual fall, it’s when spiritual death first
appeared. Death can be seen as disintegration, but the modern, protestant,
literalist mind always assumes this to be physical. Do you really think no
creatures died before Adam and Eve ate the fruit?  
  
Remember also that Lucifer fell from heaven before Adams fall. There is a far
larger canvas here than just Adam and Eve eating something. Creating free,
rational beings seems to inevitably result in at least some of them failing in
terms if pride, and therefore obedience. If it’s not inevitable, it’s at least
the case in Gods perfect plan for creation.  
  
I do however also think that the fall was necessary at some point. We are each
created unique. Some of us are like the prodigal son, and some more like his
brother. There are lessons the Father wants both types to learn as part of the
process of our creation that is this life. Without the ‘fall’ of the prodigal
son, there is no opportunity for either brother to make the right choice to
align with the father. Just as the creation of our bodies was via a process of
ongoing refinement through suffering, our reconciliation with God is a
partaking in the redemptive suffering of God as son of man. It’s of course
true that man caused our fall. But God’s plan, from a perspective we can’t
even imagine yet, is perfect. Nothing has gone wrong. Bizarre as that may seem
to us at times in the middle of it, I believe this to be true.

Well, we can't. I do call Him Goodness Itself and other cool names, though.  
  
A essencial part of this christian theodicy* is that God has a relation with
morality totally diferent than our own, see for instance the fact that He can
judge people, can kill people, can pester people until they want to do His
thing(see Jonah) etc. The Book of Job lets this clear when God finally
appears, for Job is trying to tread God as a equal the whole time, who needs
to explain His actions to him and all that, and when He finally appears He
makes very clear that Job treatment of Him as how we would do a normal person
is completely ridiculous.  
  
So the idea that God is good yes but on a more analogical than univocal way is
not a clever apologetical invention but is there on the religions of the book
since the beginning. It just sounds bizarre to me to see someone argue
otherwise, specially when the ""the names Scripture uses to talk of God should
not be understood as exactly what they mean in us"" is a thing since the church
fathers.  
  
This is important, for if God goodness is not exactly our own them His
priorities can be diferent. And, well, on the christian worldview the struggle
a believer has to be become holy, the life and struggles of the animals etc
are goods that let the universe better.  
  
Notice that even we can see value in something that requires suffering. For
instance, would you rather we, suppose we could, put all savage animals in
zoos and other controlated environments and make the ecosistems that exist now
stay functioning artificially or you would want to also let places were there
are animals living like they do and only interfere to not let extinctions and

The little logic puzzles that you are setting are tricks that you are playing
on yourself.  
  
""If logic is contingent, so is God, because the proposition 'God exists' is,
in that case, a contingent truth.""  
  
Contingent logic and contingent truth are not the same thing. Logic is a
procedure that, properly used, takes us from one truth to another. Contingent
truth is not absolute truth. ""It takes an hour to swim across the lake"",
depends on the lake, the person swimming, and other contingent factors. God
knows all the contingencies. They are in the infinite sequence which is
contingent to us, but not to God, who is absolute truth. Furthermore, the
infinite sequence is an _image_ of God, a Divine Idea, meaning that God knows
it. But an image of God is not God any more than the pixels in your digital
photo of a tree are the tree. You cannot say that the tree does not have sap
because the photo does not have sap. Similarly, you cannot say that God is
contingent from the entertainment of an image of God. The image does not show
what God is, but it shows what you cannot say that God is not. Because people,
made in the image of God, can be stupid does not imply that God is stupid.  
  
God has no procedure of using logic. God knows the procedure of logic that you
use. He created it. That procedure, properly used, is whatever God wills it to
be. Whatever he wills it to be, it still allows humans to reason from one
contingent truth to another within the composite contingent truths that humans
understand.

"I agree that some instances of suffering that happen in the world does indeed
help us to realise and understand the goodness of God. It manifests his
goodness in so far as his mercy is enough to restore even the most broken of
souls and we do see examples of this. The way in which God has arranged things
does give way to a lot of instances where he brings a greater good out of all
the evil that is taken place, the most stark example being the crucifixion
which God used to manifest his infinite mercy. Pope John Paul II as well as
Thomas Aquinas have both referred to God's mercy has his greatest attribute,
that attribute which displays his goodness in the greatest way since God is
below no one. And to top it all it was implemented by means of an Incarnation.
All these great goods would not have been possible to us in a world without
sin even if an Incarnation had taken place in that world because God's mercy
would have been conceivable to us only by contemplating the act of creation
which would be very abstract. In this world his mercy was on its fullest
display. We deserved punishment but God gave us the opposite.  
Having said all that though, I think these instances serve to show us that God
can indeed bring greater goods out of great evils and we can trust him in that
regard. They form parts of the reason why God has permitted suffering. And
it's true in a general sense. At the same time there are such ghastly acts
that humans commit, that it's hard to believe that God allowed that person to
suffer like that just because doesn't want that person to get attached to this
world, it's even worse to propose that it was deserved as punishment. In such
cases solace should be derived from the fact that even such ghastly trauma can
be healed by God's mercy and at the same time refrain from attributing any
reason to God for permitting it since we truly aren't in a position to know
why. God himself points to our cluelessness in the book of Job. In previous
posts on suffering Prof usually did underscore this point regarding particular
cases atleast up untill last years Christmas message where he posited that we
can't fathom why God has permitted the crisis in church to go on for so long.

Yes Walter. In the temporal paradise nothing would end it except a voluntary
exit (freely choosing to turn away from the presence of God). So an infinitude
of time was available, unmarred by fear, aging, or death.  
  
Now let us look at the simple model of human free will in time (in the
temporal paradise) - an infinite sequence of unbiased bits, in which lies all
possible intelligible choices encoded one way or other (you, Walter, can
choose any encoding method subject to finite computation).  
  
To be unbiased, the infinite sequence would have to contain, as a subsequence,
the choice to turn away from God (exit paradise). If the infinite sequence did
not contain the choice as a subsequence, the infinite sequence would not be an
unbiased random sequence and it would not be simple but would be complex.  
  
So the free choice to turn from God, given endless time, is inevitable.

platonist view that being and goodness are the same, so your criteria of what
a good thing is probably(i can only supose) tied to happiness in a way that
unhappiness in a large level is not the type of thing that should be desirable
at all.  
  
By contrast, someone like Aquinas would argue that even beings so fragile are
desirable for their existence allow for a major variety of good things and
even their decay and corruption is in a sense, and only in a sense, desirable
for the corruption of one material thing aways result in other things(even if
not usually living) and so ad variety.  
  
Remember that later pagans and ancient and medieval christians took effort to
argue against the gnostic view that the material world is bad because of the
inevitable corruption and decay its existence creates, which seems alive on
today antinatalists, so the view i'am defending does argue that even beings
that can and do suffer and die are good. The realism on universals, evil as

This awe and fear of being in God’s presence is not something he inspires,
it’s His infinite greatness perceived by a finite creature. It’s the shock of
reality unveiled. From behind the veil, at times He spills over such that we
can experience a diluted form of His presence where words like gentle, tender,
love, peace etc are used. For now we only see dimly, our perception is
naturally tuned to dim reality, and so it’s in this diluted form that most of
us can distinguish anything other than infinite ‘brightness’.  
  
In general you take a position that conflicts with everything revealed in
scripture. So where do you get your information on what God is, what God could
do and couldn’t do? If it’s just reason, then what makes you think you can
understand the timeless and the infinite? We can’t even think without time. If
you ignore revelation, what makes you think humans are able to understand such
things any more than ants can understand Special Relativity?  
  
When Jesus Bar Joseph was convicted, Pilate gave the people the option to
choose between him and Jesus Barabbas (“son of the father”). Two messianic
figures representing two different human perspectives, one human, one divine.

thee behind me Satan”.  
  
This is made clearer by the three temptations that Jesus was given in the

“But as for the good things of this life, and its ills,” Augustine writes,
“God has willed that these should be common to both; that we might not too
eagerly covet the things which wicked men are seen equally to enjoy, nor
shrink with an unseemly fear from the ills which even good men often suffer.”  
  
This explanation does apply to children. And the problem here is simply not an
issue for animals, since they have no propensity to covet too eagerly nor to
shrink with unseemly fear from the ills which they and their fellows suffer.
Not being intelligent, animals have no capacity for justifying (or even
questioning) the ways of God to animals (or, of course, to man).",821

"@Walter. I agree we’re going around in circles. I could use an analogy of a
mother shouting at her daughter to get out of the busy road, and of the elder
brother feeling empathy for his sister while accepting that the telling off
was necessary. However you will take that in a univocal sense where you can’t
translate this onto the big picture, or focus on the idea that I’m claiming
that suffering is God ‘telling us off’, which is not the point at all.  
  
I don’t claim to understand the whole picture, but there is a beauty in the
universe that relies on this balance between the good stuff and the bad stuff,
where our overcoming of difficulties are in a way more valuable because of the
difficulties. Without decay physical reality would be a disgusting mess,
without suffering our bodies could not have evolved. If you see the physical
world as everything, and our physical existence as the peak of some very lucky
random circumstances over time, as I did as an atheist, then the idea of this
physical universe as a phase of an essentially spiritual creation process
makes no sense at all. So instead you decide that a good God would instead
just create something like angels in a paradise, and not bother with the often
messy physical universe and human beings at all. Which seems to me to loose a
great deal of richness from existence, for all it’s troubles. Some of the

Humans do not have the ability to ""choose something bad"" _under the aspect of_
its badness. The human free will is only able to choose something under the
aspect of a good. However, a human on this Earth can choose a lesser good
instead of a greater good, (because we can consider in a limited way diverse
_aspects_ of their good or lack of good) and this can represent _an evil
choosing_. But this is, per se, a manner of being made in limited perfection,
limited in part by the condition of not seeing the One Absolutely Complete
Good directly and immediately. When we obtain that latter condition in the
Beatific Vision, we will retain our free will but we _will not_ be able to
choose badly: in that Vision we will see that no other good than God could
_even seem_ to be preferable to God. And we will see all other goods _fully_
in their reference to God.",1255

"Of course Christian doctrine does not lead us to expect little or no
suffering, but that is a strong argument against Christian doctrine .  
The problem of evil (or suffering) does not say that there should not be so
much evil or suffering if _Christian doctrine_ is true, it says that the
existence of (so much) evil or suffering is incompatible with a tri-omni God
and _hence_ Christian doctrine, along with other doctrines about God, is
false. IOW Christian doctrine _cannot_ be true.  
It is hardly a secret that ""the Fall"" is one giant theodicy right from the
start. But it's a bad theodicy for several reasons, the most important one
being that a tri-omni God would not allow for any fall. Without the Fall human
beings would have experienced the beatific vision without the need of
suffering.  
  
Moreover, this article does not explain why the good are punished and neither
does Augustine, it actually comes down to ""nobody is good"" or ""the good are
not really punished."".  
People who ""shrink from doing their duty to condemn the wickedness that
surrounds them"" are not good, so they do not present a case af good people
being punished.  
  
And if ""the loss of worldly blessings – material goods, reputation,
friendships, health, livelihood, even life itself – is permitted by God so
that we might learn not to cling to these things at the expense of the
beatific vision, the value of which trumps all else"", that may explain why
good people suffer but it isn't a punishment.

"Walter, we know by the faith (which is the only way we know about original
sin) that the fall makes quite a difference; prior to it, in a hypothetical
state of nature (according to St. Thomas), humans would have been able to
avoid sinning even venially. As for the only state in which men actually
existed before the fall (original justice), they had many other advantages as
well, like not dying. The fall made quite a difference to the state of men as
they arrive in the world now, as millions of Catholic sermons have not tired
of repeating.

"@Walter  
  
Do i not? One of the classical responses a theist make to the problem of evil
is to say ""there are certain goods that could only be gained in a world like
our own"". Even platonists argue that.  
  
Well, the christian does have the example of the saints, whose suffering and
hardships make their lifes noble and interesting* not only to us but even to
themselves. To a christian, suffering is supposed to be seen not as a crappy
thing, but as a way of uniting with Christ and climbing the latter to being
similar to Him.  
  
Not only on they but on normal people, perhaps even on your case, you can see
people who look at terrible times they had and see their better situation as
enobled or even justified by the bad times. This even on totally secular
contexts, not considering the beatific vision(who would turn everything
acceptable to the receiver).  
  
This actually seems probably a very alien thinking to a modern unbeliever,
except that Nietzsche did get there, so read eventually the start of the City
of God, the part that Dr. Feser is quoting, slowly and trying to see things
like St. Augustine. Perhaps it help. Likely not, for it is quite a jump.  
  
And remember: this is not a way to us to see this world as justified, but a
way to trying to see how God could see things that way. The same God that do a
lot of things we humans cant do, like kill people and all that.  
  
But anyway, trying to grow on this worldview i realized that the christians
and a average person today, even several theists, see the relevant things with
completely diferent eyes, so who knows how much this discussion can do.
Existential considerations are very important.  
  
*which is not to argue that becoming good by suffering is necessarily better than starting good. In the christian context God created humans and angels, who represent both options",1862
"I think people sometimes take original sin too much like a theory of physics.
Once you do that it can lead to misunderstandings. Perhaps think of it instead
as God creating nature with a telos, in fact a hierarchy of teloi, with
everything drawn towards his divine idea(l)s (using Augustines terms). What
the fall represents is us starting to choose our own sub-teloi, of having
“knowledge” of what is “good” for us. Once we do the conscious choosing, we
generally do a pretty bad job of it, as can be seen immediately with Cain, and
that has consequences that ripple across everything. Like a stone thrown into
a calm pond.  
  
In order to recover our correct place in nature so that we can become
participants in God’s original creation, working with him rather that towards
our own faulty choice of sub-telos, we have to aim towards God’s original
idea(l) of man.  
  
Fortunately He has helped us hugely here. The incarnation was not just(!) the
sacrifice that gained the reconciliation of the consequences of our bad
choices, it also gave us the perfect example of the divine ideal we were
created to be. So in choosing to be more like him, as far as we can in our
puny efforts, we become participants in God’s great act of creation that is
this universe (and we get help in this). On this path even the delights of the
world become good, and we can have life to the full (though not without
suffering yet).  
  
If we don’t - but rather continue to create our own sub-teloi - then even good
intentions can lead us away from completion, away from union with the creator.
For those whose chosen teloi, their highest good and highest desires, are the
base pleasures of the world, it is them who are choosing eternal torment. We
are made to rest in Him, not in base things which will always bring their own
suffering.

As I already indicated, the state of a man on Earth able to sin _is indeed_
less complete and less perfect than his state in heaven, when he is no longer

perfection may be called ""imperfection"" in one sense, or it may be called a
""more limited"" condition that is _proper to one still in this life_ : Either
way, one must keep the _sense_ being used clear. Hence, one cannot employ the
position that our ""being able to sin"" represents an ""imperfection"" and
conclude that this contradicts Genesis saying that when God made the world, it
was ""good"" because man able to sin is ""not good"". That doesn't follow. A lamb
is able to die, and that's a lack of divine perfection (for God cannot die),
but it's a kind of ""im""perfection that is more properly understood as a
_lesser kind_ of perfection. And God intended a universe filled with beings
which are imperfect compared to Him, because it is impossible for Him to have
created beings that are uncreated perfection. He also intended a universe with
men who were capable of sin who then could achieve later the condition of the
Beatific Vision and no longer able to sin, by way of meritorious acts of love

Good point there, we do accept suffering a lot. I just suppose that Walter

@Walter  
  
I see what you are saying. Just a correction: on the view i'am defending God
is beyond what we usually mean by good, for He has no essence separate from
His essence that He must be a great exemplar of, but is THE good that we all
recept a fraction, you could say. It is not a case of the voluntaristic view
were God chooses things to be good for no reason so i dont see much
circularity. The name ""good"" that we use to Him mean only that He has no lack,
but it has little to do with our virtues.  
  
Now, could this Being, beyond our good but also its cause, choose something
that we would not choose? I would say that we just cant know much of this
answer a priori. Since God has no nature that we can separate from Him and say
""His nature is to choose such and such"" them there is a sense were, while He
can by no means be evil*, He is sure hard to predict.  
  
Notice that the monotheistic-or-close pagans, that had no Bible, normally did
not really treat God as much similar to us. This because pure reason cant
really show much of how He thinks, only that He cant be bad(and what i
mentioned below). This world, revelation, the Incarnation, these are all
suprises that say a bit more of who He is but only say so much.  
  
  
*for being evil is to lack virtues, and God does not lack anything.

doing the small bit we can to help those suffering in their different ways is

Genesis 1:33 claims God created all animals vegetarians  
  
The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with
the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a
little child shall lead them.  
7 And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down
together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.  
  
See also Isaiah 65. With the prophecied coming of God's holy mountain, there
will be no animal predation and suffering. So animal predation and suffering
were not original in God's magic garden, nor are necessary now. If such
suffering exists, then it is not necessary and is all God's fault.

"@Walter and anon. I’m deliberately using necessary in a way that will not be
popular here. I think a huge amount of time and credibility is wasted on
arguing whether God had choice in something. Pretty much all of those
arguments are meaningless. There are some realities God could have brought
forth that we can sort of imagine, say that there are two temporal dimensions
and four spatial dimensions. Really tricky to actually get your head around,
but we have at least some ability to do so. There are others where we just
incapable of even imagining. To argue about God’s choices is therefore
meaningless unless he revealed something about it.  
  
When I use necessary here, I mean it purely in that it seems necessary in
order to achieve God’s plan, which is at least in part to create children who
choose to be as like Him, and can therefore participate with Him in the
Trinity. That is an astounding thing, a top down view of the telos of the
universe.  
  
Arguing what is necessary from a bottom up perspective in the way that
philosophers tend to, in terms of what God could and could not do, is like
ants on a cathedral wall arguing about the cathedral’s architecture and
construction. Yes they are builders themselves and so know something of
building, but it’s several orders of magnitude higher in it’s nature than ants
are capable of conceiving. So if Brunelleschi was able to hear the ants
debate, he would perhaps smile, but he would not bother trying to reveal the
answers to their ponderings as it would just not make sense to them. He would
have to wait until their understanding was no longer constrained by their
antness.",1643

Starting from the Christian understanding of evil as ""that which is contrary
to nature"", what are those evils you see in the world that God has done? And
how could God prevent the evils in the world without also preventing the
wonderful goods that accidentally give rise to them or to which by Divine
mercy they lead? As St. Dionysius wrote ""Almighty God knows the evil qua good;
and, with Him, the causes of the evils are powers producing good.""  
  
Perhaps you wish there were corruptible natures that could not be corrupted
and passible natures that could not suffer (without seeing the contradiction)
or you wish God Almighty to have limited His power and not created natures
that through their weakness are corruptible and passible, thus preventing such
natures to be actualized and participate in the Good that He is.",837

If by ""autonomy"" you mean that a created nature can exist and have an activity
of its own without God's creative and sustaining activity then there is
nothing having autonomy, but that doesn't mean that its own activity and the
effects that it produces are the work of God. For example if God created
animals and sustains their generative power it doesn't mean that their
particular generative activities and effects are the work of God. If fire

"David,  
  
""And it is absurd to bring to bear the (your) standards of human moral agency
to attempt to critique what (little) you understand to be God's exercise of
his moral agency.""  
  
I think I can very much make a good analogy here. And my point is I believe I
know some necessary moral facts which allow me to say what God can or cannot
do (will or will not do). For instance, I am totally confident that it is
impossible for God to create a universe consisting of nothing but children
being burnt, tortured in horrible pain until they die and are annihilated -
they don't even go to heaven eventually, nothing. I am confident that God
cannot do that because it would be immoral.  
So I can use my knowledge of morality to know what God can or cannot do. Of
course, my knowledge will be limited and I could be mistaken about some
things, but that goes for anything and it doesn't mean I can't draw rational
conclusions here. And of some things I am very confident.  
  
""(what with ""ceteris paribus""* and all that -- wink wink) it's really not?""  
  
The ceteris paribus clause is there just because I am open to human suffering
possibly serving a greater good through e.g. soul-building theodicies,
""becoming stronger/virtuous through pain"", whatever. But the ceteris paribus
version of the proposition is still true, and so human suffering is something
that God should seek to alleviate/prevent, unless there is a stronger reason
why he can't/shouldn't (and that is when we are led to theodicy).  
  
""But in any case, so what? What are you alleging against the Almighty here?
That you're having trouble shaking the suspicion that you might have a better
grasp of Necessary Moral Truths than he does?""  
  
No? The point is that if God exists, he cannot fall short of the standards of
necessary moral truths as I was talking about. (Indeed, for me he would be the
Good itself, and the Good obviously cannot fall short of those moral facts;
rather they are supposed to be reflections of the Good, which is only more
reason to expect more of him than us, not less). And this sets up the problem
of evil, because clearly the world is prima facie a pretty crappy place.  
  
""It's not that hard, actually. If God is indifferent to (e.g.) a child being
tortured... (etc.)""  
  
""So again, back to the classic question: ""What if God was one of us,""  
  
What if God is truly and perfectly good and wise.  
  
""But as you yourself say: ""In which case he would not be God, as God is
supposed to be."" -- Right, but...""  
  
Yeah, but the point is that the problem of evil is a challenge to God's
existence. And it cannot be solved by holding that God, ""not a moral agent"",
could really just be indifferent to horrible evils and do nothing about them,
and so the existence of horrible evils ""could not possibly be incompatible
with him"". This solution doesn't work unless one is okay with (absurdly)
turning God into a seriously defective, irrational being, unworthy of worship
(because this is what it would be entailed by it for most people, myself
included). So the Davies line adds nothing to the problem; at the end of the
day, we need the standard responses (skeptical theism, theodicies, etc.).
Those responses come with an epistemic cost, but the theist must deal with
that.  ",3284

Exactly! The problem in the end seems* one of faith, of trusting that God
knows what He is doing even when we dont. He can and does take the good out of
evil, we just do not know how this is so and that is okay.  
  
As St. Augustine shows,we can have some idea of how the bad things are
necessary to the goods on a general sense, but, as he does admit on the book,
how bad things individually have their part only God knows, so in the end we
need to trust.  
  
Walking this path is showing me that a large part of the dificult is exactly
on one relation with God: someone who sees Him as distant or as a idea is more
prone to not being okay with trusting. Bring that together with a focus only
on this life and one will find very dificult to see how God can choose this
world.

Of course, you can argue that the Christian God is evil either according to
Christianity own view of goodness or a diferent view of goodness that is taken
to be objective.  
  
I'am taking care of arguing against the view that God can be seen as evil on
the christian own standards but i admit that this is not much because you
clearly take a diferent view on goodness, seeing your argumentation and being
a vegetarian, so you could aways reply ""yea, this god is not evil if we accept
a wrong definition of good"". I suppose that this is why you say that
apologists are changing the definition if goodness.  
  
On the christian view, God can be said to do good to us not only in giving us
the chance of Heaven but even in creating we as imperfect as we are. Even
existing badly is better that not existing for being is intrinsically good.
Now, the zoo example and your vegetarianism* show that you disagree with this,
i suppose that being is not good to you on every situation or case and, living
on a world were suffering is so prevalescent, i can see were this come from,
it is a judgment impossible to never make at least for a moment while living
under the sun.  
  
So i think that i see the source of the disagreement here: you and the
christian tradition have diferent views on goodness that change the perception
of this world and the judgment of Goodness Itself making it. To agree with the
christian message you would need a radical change on value that the christian
tradition(at least on your view) need way more evidence to justify.  
  
Anyway, i hope that at least i could make the christian response i'am
defending appear less ad hoc, for i do see it as being internally coherent.
The discussion helped see the disagreement more clearly, thanks! Dont know if
we should go to discussing the accounts of good directly today.

rebelled, the fall happened. Did they had horrific consequences? Sure enough.
Did something good happened because of it that would not have happened

Original sin was the fall of creation and suffering was the consequence of
this fall. We are all in this fallen creation. No one is being ""punished"", not
even Adam and Eve. They just inevitably chose sin given free will and time.
Human free will can also be modelled by an infinite unbiased random binary
sequence so all choices exist in it somewhere (as simple a model as you are
likely to find). Adam and Eve, in time, chose to leave temporal paradise and
enter the fallen creation. Knowledge of good and evil meant a return to
temporal paradise was gone without the intervention of God to bring them to
the new creation, the eternal (outside of time) paradise with God.  
  
This is where we are, all of us, people, babies, good people, bad people,
dogs, ticks, mosquitos, and viruses. There is only one creation (simplicity
again). We are all in it together. God did not cause multiple worlds for each
to choose, and by the choice define right and wrong (for you are the one
claiming to redefine things, not me). As a human with an infinite component to
your mind, since you are free, you can always choose your own way to stay
separate from God. In eternity (outside of time), when the new creation
replaces this one, choosing will no longer be possible, so if you have elected
to be separate from God, you will stay separate from God.  
  
The world we live in is not so by necessity. It could have been anything
(modelled by the random sequence). It could have been a world in which 1+ 1 is
3 and the rules of logic could have been anything. But the world we live in is
the way it is because of love. Love, not necessity. Love is why after
inevitably (given endless time) exiting temporal paradise, there is still
Salvation if you freely choose it. The innocent, even mosquitos (which are
actually rather beautiful) will have an appropriate room in God's eternal
mansion, where the leopard lies down with the kid and the suckling child plays

part, private as described (the reason for modelling it as random), directs

Where suffering of animals is as part of nature, we must trust that to God.
Life could not have evolved without suffering, and we must trust that the rich
tapestry of dark and light is perfectly rounded in the end. “All is well” as
He told Julian of Norwich. This is just faith in God’s goodness, and I have
confidence that the great suffering of animals in nature will make be a
necessary part of a perfect plan when we see things as they are.  
  
Where it’s caused by humans, we are responsible. We each are called to play
our part in reducing the suffering of others, as far as we are able. I can’t
judge a poor person who overworks a donkey to build a house, or buys factory
farmed meat, but those who can afford to support better welfare and always
choose the cheapest/cruelest must be at least partly responsible for the
cruelty.  
  
It’s similar with children. We can’t see God’s full plan, but we know that
life is short for all of us next to eternity. We can only play our part in
reducing it where we can, and trust the rest to God.  
  
As Augustine alludes to, some who have suffered the most can become the
purest, most loving people you could meet. Others become hard and cruel. God
is refining us like “silver in the furnace”. If we go with the process as he
asks us to, and most of the saints actually welcome suffering in themselves,
we have good reason to believe that it’s to our benefit in the long run. Most
difficult of course is when it’s others suffering, especially those we love.
But it’s exactly the same in that we can do what we can to help (including
righteous anger in the very rare cases where that is the right response), but
must do all we can to avoid becoming hard and cruel ourselves in response.
Difficult as it may be, we must trust. We must try to see that what is sharp
and apparently meaningless in the moment, is very different from the widest
perspective.  
  
Ultimately we are all called to follow the “suffering servant”, born to “Our
Lady of Sorrows”. Which is why the modern “I don’t believe in God because of

so that God could prepare the new creation in eternity where his choice at
death became eternal. All he, or you, have to do is hold to the right choice
at your death. Given understanding, you can, through your simple free will,
achieve this.

While it seems you are in general misunderstanding and misinterpreting what I
said (you say, ""I completely disagree""; I think it would be closer to say that
you completely misunderstand, since almost all of what you say is tangential,
not contradictory, to what I said), you are at least quite correct to use the
word ""eminently"" here. But you are evidently fatally deceived as to the
meaning of that term, since you believe (apparently?!) that creatures ""come to
possess"" these same eminent perfections when they are perfected, implying
(most incorrectly) that the perfection of creatures consists in becoming God.
Even if this view were not badly mistaken, it would be irrelevant to your
pretension to assess the workings of God's moral agency, which is clearly not
made from the standpoint of any such ""perfect(ed)"" agent, i.e., from the
standpoint of an agent who could conceivably have grounds for critiquing a
""fellow perfect-moral-agent,"" i.e., a fellow God. (FYI, the answer to the
classic question, ""What if God was one of us, just a slob like one of us?"" is
""In that case your critique of 'him' would make sense (that is, it could have
an intelligible logical grounding); but more importantly, in that case 'he'
wouldn't actually be God."")",1436

"""If the tree of life was necessary for Adam and Eve to live forever, one might
reasonably ask, did animals have access to the tree of life? The answer seems
to be no.  
  
If the tree of life was unique, it might have been enough for Adam and Eve to
eat from, but it would never have been enough for all of the animals of the
world to eat from. This may be another sign that the animals were not
understood to have the tree of life for their food. If so, then the text of
Genesis itself would suggest that, while man was meant to be immortal, animals
were not. That would support the idea, based on St. Paul’s statement, that it
was human death that entered the world through the Fall, not animal death.  
  
Furthermore, we should note that giving “every green plant” to animals as food
does not mean that some of them weren’t also carnivores. It’s not as if,
before original sin, lions ate dandelions and toadstools and only afterward
did they begin picking on poor old wildebeest. This is something Thomas
Aquinas wrote about in his Summa Theologica:  
  
In the opinion of some, those animals which now are fierce and kill others,
would, in that state, have been tame, not only in regard to man, but also in
regard to other animals. But this is quite unreasonable. For the nature of
animals was not changed by man’s sin, as if those whose nature now it is to
devour the flesh of others, would then have lived on herbs, as the lion and
falcon.  
  
(We should add, lest anyone be tempted to think that this is a forced retreat
in the face of modern evolutionary theory, that Thomas wrote these words
nearly 550 years prior to the birth of Charles Darwin.)""",1659
"In chapter 8, Augustine notes that while there is in this life _some_
connection between evildoing and suffering on the one hand, and righteousness
and blessings on the other, it is very far from tight. The wicked enjoy many
good things, while the good suffer much misfortune. To be sure, this will be
redressed in the afterlife, when the good will be rewarded with eternal
happiness and the wicked with eternal torment. “But as for the good things of
this life, and its ills,” Augustine writes, “God has willed that these should
be common to both; that we might not too eagerly covet the things which wicked
men are seen equally to enjoy, nor shrink with an unseemly fear from the ills
which even good men often suffer.”",721
"Hi Ed,  
  
You write:  
  
As Augustine says, there isn’t “any evil [that] happens to the faithful and
godly which cannot be turned to profit,” so that, with St. Paul, “we know that
all things work together for good to them that love God” (Romans 8:28).  
  
I have to say that Augustine's remark sounds very Pollyanna-ish. There are
some evils which can only be described as soul-breaking, rather than soul-
making. Three which come to mind are rape, mutilation and torture. These are
horrendous sufferings which serve no ""greater good,"" and which can destroy
even a good individual's faith, as the following account of the 17th century
""torture in the pit"" illustrates:  
  
https://sspx.org/en/news-events/news/real-life-silences-character  
  
There were priests, many of them good men, who apostasized. What good was
served?  
  
You also cite Augustine to support the following claim: ""We cannot achieve
happiness in the world to come if we become too attached to the world that is,
and suffering is a means of preventing the latter.""  
  
This might explain some of the suffering that befalls adults, but it fails to
explain the death and suffering of a child, who has no worldly attachments.  
  
Finally, original sin (or the fall of Adam) is said to be the ultimate
explanation for why humans are permitted to suffer and die, rather than
enjoying immortality and bliss. I am not persuaded that a dumb choice by a
distant ancestor makes it fair for us to be allowed to suffer soul-breaking
evils of the sort described above, but let that pass. What original sin cannot
explain is the fact that people (e.g. political prisoners, psychiatric
patients) have been beaten or tortured to death, while screaming for Divine
deliverance or at least some Divine consolation (i.e. a sense of ""I am with
you"") at the moment of death, and in many cases, it never arrives: they die in
agony and desolation. Spiritual abandonment at the hour of death is the most
difficult evil of all to make sense of, and if you can make any sense of it,
Ed, you're a better man than I.  
  
For my part, I think it's best to honestly acknowledge that some evil in this
world is indeed gratuitous and senseless, and that there are some dark
recesses of the human psyche which God Himself cannot reach: He can console us
while we're in pain, but not while we're in agony, as that severs the
communication channels. In some cases, then, we meet God only on the other
side. Cheers.",2458
"_Accordingly this seems to me to be one principal reason why the good are
chastised along with the wicked, when God is pleased to visit with temporal
punishments the profligate manners of a community. They are punished together,
not because they have spent an equally corrupt life, but because the good as
well as the wicked, though not equally with them, love this present life;
while they ought to hold it cheap, that the wicked, being admonished and
reformed by their example, might lay hold of life eternal... For so long as
they live, it remains uncertain whether they may not come to a better mind.

"Dr. Feser, thank you for a solid post on suffering.  
  
A few of the comments above have brought up the problem of ""animal pain.""
While I understand the standard response to that to be something along the
lines of ""necessity justified in view of the perfection of creation,"" I'm
wondering if there is not a richer answer hidden in the back of our tradition.
Specificly, I'm wondering about the role of angels in all this.  
  
Think of something like Tolkien's cosmology - physical evil and disorder
entered into creation when the principalities and powers of the world (The
Valar and Maiar) entered into conflict with each other, one desiring to
fullfill the creators plan to make a habitation for the ""children of
illuvitar"" (rational life), and others, out to make a dominion for themselves.
As proper ""sub-creators,"" God, in his secondary causality, had given spiritual
beings the duties of care and creation in the physical world, and the flaws,
imperfections, and downright violence of creation were due to the infidelity
of some of the powers intrusted to their care. If we hold the standard line
that fallen angels fell in the first instant of their creation, and, further,
that they had been, nevertheless, been given dominion over certain parts or
aspects of creation, then Johanine language about the ""lord of this world,""
and Pauline language about the ""princes of the powers of the air,"" makes a lot
more sense, and can even be joined to an evolutionary cosmology.  
  
The universe is an odd place, and the creation of the conditions for life, let
alone rational life, in an odd, (physically fallen?) cosmos could be seen as
the fruit of angelic conquest over malign forces. Furthermore, evolution
itself might be seen as being helped along or guided by forces trying to bring
about God's will in creation.  
  
This sounds fantasic, even as I write it, but I'm wondering if anyone else has
explored this train of thought.",1937

addiction to pornography and the marital problems it brings in its wake; the
loneliness and economic insecurity of women who in their youth were used by

I do not necessarily reject the idea that being and goodness are the same, but
if that's so, being should be good and not be bad in any way. It doesn't

Hence, there cannot be anything bad. And that's the crux of the problem and
that's why the Classical Theism isn't consistent.  
To say that even bad things should exist is simply logically impossible ""if""
being is good. That's a straightforward contradiction.  
  
Sure, if an infinite multiverse exists, then somewhere, Quark the Ferengi
exists. That may not be an insane idea, but it is not the standard Christian
view, which is that God could have chosen not to create anything at all.  
Your claim about qualitative and quantitative maximization is interesting
here, because it contradicts what you claimed before, namely that ""being is
intrinsically good"". if being is intrinsically good, then not being is
intrinsically bad, so Quark the Ferengi not existing would be intrinsically
bad. Whether my ""type"" of goodness exists in someone else doesn't make my non-

wicked men. The Christian must also _criticize them_ for their wickedness, and
try to get them to repent of it. To be sure, Augustine goes on to acknowledge
that there may be occasions where one might justifiably opt to postpone such
criticism until an opportune moment, or refrain from it out of a reasonable
fear of doing more harm than good. But he teaches here that it is _not_
justifiable to refrain from such criticism merely because it is difficult, or
because we fear causing offense and losing friends, or because we don’t want
to risk losing status or other worldly goods. For the wicked are in danger _of
damnation_ if they do not repent, and we “wickedly blind ourselves” if we
shirk our duty to encourage them to do so. Even if we avoid damnation
ourselves, we will justly suffer alongside them when divine providence visits
_this-worldly_ punishments upon them (social and economic disorder, natural

I think you’re confusing different types of suffering. Often people don’t

perspective of physical health. However we generally make the choice there, we
understand how it helps our health. What about a young child forced not to
ride it’s tricycle on a busy road, or to take some bad tasting medicine. In
these cases most children don’t understand the end good. A few children may
trust their parents, and so for them (and there parents!) it’s not really a
problem. For others, the hurt and pain they feel at the unfairness of it all
often causes them far more problems than the bad taste or the limited cycling
options.

reverse of the truth. The Catholic faith teaches that suffering [is the
inexorable consequence](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2021/09/the-first-

essential part](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2022/05/nietzsche-and-christ-

overcoming sinful habits of thought and action. It is the inevitable
concomitant of the persecution Christians must face for preaching the Gospel
and condemning the world’s wickedness. It is an inescapable punishment for
sin, which we must embrace in a penitential spirit. By way of suffering we pay
both our own temporal debt and that of others for whom we might offer up our
suffering. By way of it we most closely unite ourselves to Christ’s Passion.

We can of course only see that very dimly indeed, but it’s clear that the “new

vain, no more pain of witnessing your children's misfortune. The wolf and the
lamb eat together, even the lion no longer eats other creatures. So it seems
clear to me from revelation that these things are a necessary phase of
creation. When God creates he says it’s “good”, even though He knew it would
contain elements that would not be part of the second creation. Once we were
consciously able to choose between Him and not-Him, we often chose the latter.
However it’s in making this choice correctly when it’s not obvious or easy
that we ‘grow up’, as in we become as our Father intended.  
  
Now I agree with you that we can imagine universes where we would be free and
where we could easily see what is right, where there is no suffering of us or
others to make us ‘loose heart’, and where there are no bright and shiny false
lights with temporary excitement and pleasure. However, like the vines planted
in good, loamy soil, which produce great big bunches of grapes but poor wine,
there is clearly a need for us to struggle a bit in an apparently sub optimal
environment for the creation process to have a successful end point. How God
knows that, we cannot know. Did He tune creation like a quantum experiment,
with all possible realities happening, and from eternity selected the one that
worked best? Or did He just know, because He is infinite and absolute in all
things? I suspect the latter, but the point is that we see a very small part
of the creation process. The people who have the most issue with it nearly

if I don't go for a bike ride today, even though the weather isn't very good
here and the ride will not be all pleasant, I could lose my shape, which could
lead to a lot more suffering.  
Notice that the main goal is to _avoid_ serious suffering, not to cherish it.  
That's like the fire brigade. It is a good, but it is only relative. if there
were no possible fires, a fire brigade would not be a good. If God didn't
create a world of suffering for us, suffering (even mild suffering) would not
be a good.",893
"Walter,  
  
I don't think I understand your response. I did not mean to suggest that God
could not have stopped the Fall (if ""the Fall"" happened; I was just using that
as an example) with sheer power, but rather that a world like ours in which
the Fall happened might be better than a world in which the Fall never
happened. Or that, from the point of view of perfect rationality, one should
not have attempted to prevent the Fall. It seems to me that there are many
possible reasons, even beyond our ken, for why God could not have prevented
the Fall without some immorality, or perhaps without sacrificing a greater
good that could morally justify his inaction.  
  
I do not deny that there is a plausibility to thinking that, prima facie, if
God existed, the world should look a lot better than it is. Speaking for
myself, I think it raises the probability of atheism to some degree, but I
find it very hard to go beyond a prima facie impression here. It seems the
problem of evil would require us to adopt a ""God's eye"" point of view that I
don't think people can reliably have (I certainly can't have it, at the
moment). I am not even sure enough about everything in morality. There are
moral dillemas that I am unsure about, for example.  
  
And while it strikes me as absolutely obvious that (e.g.) having an innocent
person being tortured forever for no reason would be necessarily horrible, and
the kind of thing that God/a perfect being could not do or be okay with, I am
not at all sure about (and even see some plausibility in) theodicies where
suffering builds a person's character (perhaps even in heaven, looking back?)
and could contribute to a better end-state in the world and the victim will be
in heaven in eternal happiness, etc.  
  
I do not think that we can reliably have a ""God's eye"" point of view for the
evils in the world to confidently say that a perfect being couldn't have
permitted them, or that there could be no morally justifiable plan behind it,
etc. I know that God (if God exists) could not be indifferent to them or not-
intervening for no good reason. But I do not know enough to confidently say
that there can be no reason for it all. To put it differently, I am not
confident that there isn't a working theodicy out there, between heaven and
earth, beyond my knowledge. And I think you shouldn't be confident, either",2363
"_Where can we readily find a man who holds in fit and just estimation those
persons on account of whose revolting pride, luxury, and avarice, and cursed
iniquities and impiety, God now smites the earth as His predictions
threatened? Where is the man who lives with them in the style in which it
becomes us to live with them?  For often we wickedly blind ourselves to the
occasions of teaching and admonishing them, sometimes even of reprimanding and
chiding them, either because we shrink from the labor or are ashamed to offend
them, or because we fear to lose good friendships, lest this should stand in
the way of our advancement, or injure us in some worldly matter, which either
our covetous disposition desires to obtain, or our weakness shrinks from
losing.  So that, although the conduct of wicked men is distasteful to the
good, and therefore they do not fall with them into that damnation which in
the next life awaits such persons, yet, because they spare their damnable sins
through fear, therefore, even though their own sins be slight and venial, they
are justly scourged with the wicked in this world, though in eternity they
quite escape punishment. Justly, when God afflicts them in common with the
wicked, do they find this life bitter, through love of whose sweetness they
declined to be bitter to these sinners_.",1332
"""For my part, I think it's best to honestly acknowledge that some evil in this
world is indeed gratuitous and senseless, and that there are some dark
recesses of the human psyche which God Himself cannot reach: He can console us
while we're in pain, but not while we're in agony, as that severs the
communication channels. In some cases, then, we meet God only on the other
side.""  
  
That seems to severely limit omnipotence, and just the divine power in
general. How is it that God cannot help these people in desperate need?
Especially since he's still the creator of all and has to maintain everything
going, to suggest that he cannot stop a torturer in any way or talk to someone
in their moment of agony seems ridiculous.  
  
Even worse, some people are capable of helping those in need and comforting
them in death. But God can't? I can do something that this God can't, like
that? This is not God, this is some type of friendly alien-parent I have no
intention to worship (although I would be interested in still being friends
with him, more as equals)  
  
And if God cannot help these people at that time of need, how could we even
trust him to be able to help them AFTER death? If anything it just makes it
less likely. He wasn't able to do anything when people were alive, now
suddenly he's gonna be able to help them after death? That seems implausible.  
  
What we need is full-blooded rationalist theodicy coupled with skeptical
theism. There are some morally sufficient reasons for why God allows so many
horrors for a finite time here, and they may well be beyond our understanding.
But God must have his reasons, and he also is capable of compensating for
everything in (perhaps) heaven, an infinite afterlife, etc.  
  
Having to hold that there are morally sufficient reasons for all the evil is
certainly a bad cost, but it's still the best cost (at least in my judgment).
Better than limiting God so much or embracing atheism (both seem more
problematic to me)",1985

It doesn't matter whether the fall is spiritual or not.  
Creating free rational beings does not imply some of them falling in terms of
pride. It only implies this if rational creatures are created with an
uncontollable sense of pride. But it does not follow that a rational creature
must be proud.  
Anyway, even if it's true that _some_ creatures ""fall"" in this way, that is
the problem of those creatures, and not my problem. The fall is a theodicy
that is supposed to show that due to the fact that _some_ fell, we _all_
suffer, including the ""good"" who do not have the sin of pride. They do not
have any ""lesson"" to learn.because they have already made the right choice to
align with the father.  
And that is why the Fall a very bad theodicy.  
  ",801
"You can also say that they are too young to reject it and denounce God, thus
getting blame instead of merit. But I don't see why the why of suffering
should be seen as a kind of test to which moral agents are subjected, animals
suffer in their animality even if they aren't moral agents. If suffering is
used by God as a test and as a teaching aid for moral agents it doesn't mean
that God's use of it is that which generates it.",429
"I agree with Walter that the ""God is good only in an analogical sense, not a
univocal one!"" is a horrible and useless defense. As he said, when there is an
analogy there is something in common; in particular, in ""God is good"" there is
an analogy of proper proportionality. It is not a metaphor. For the classical
theist, God is the source of all actualities - and that includes virtues and
moral agency -, and as the source of all perfection and pure act God must
FORMALLY possess all pure perfections (that is, perfections that in themselves
include no limitation), but in an eminent way. The formal possession of pure
perfections by God is insisted upon by many thomists (e.g. Garrigou-Lagrange)
and is compatible with analogy (again, it's an analogy of proper
proportionality).  
  
Therefore, one can only say that ""God is not a moral agent"" or ""God is not
virtuous"" if one believes that moral agency and virtue are not pure
perfections. But I think it's obvious that they are pure perfections; the fact
that moral agency is found in us in a limited, creaturely manner doesn't make
it any less of a perfection just like the fact that wisdom is found in us in a
changing, limited, creaturely manner doesn't mean wisdom is not a perfection -
and the theist certainly says God is wise in a literal way. God is therefore
also properly said to be morally good - indeed, morally perfect - and this
goodness cannot contradict what seems basic to us with regard to evil, moral
value, etc. Just like we wouldn't say God is omniscient if he didn't literally
know (e.g.) that we exist. This is also why I think the ""Brian Davies"" line of
approaching the PoE is entirely useless. And it has nothing to do with
classical theism per se, but rather with moral virtue being or not being a
pure perfection. Needless to say, most people would agree that if God does not
at all care to stop a child from being tortured, then God is seriously
deficient (which should be impossible).  
  
Walter,  
  
That being said, I wonder how you can feel so confident about the presence of
suffering on this earth being totally pointless, and that it would be better
to have a world (e.g.) without any Fall at any point. Don't you think that
lies beyond your cognitive capacities? At the very least, doesn't it give you
pause? It is very clear to me that, for instance, a world consisting of
nothing but innocent people being tortured without end is a horrible world and
God could not make it. But while that is clear, it is not at all clear to me
that it would be immoral to have a world in which people suffered for some
finite time on earth, and then went on to enjoy a much longer happy afterlife.
And it is far from clear to me that the finite sufferings experienced in that
world could not end up contributing to making the good end-state better, or
just allowing for a good amount of soul-building, etc. I think you should give
more credit to skeptical theism.  
  
Don't get me wrong, I do see the strength in the problem of evil. But it seems
to me that you are a bit too confident in the idea that there could be no
morally sufficient reasons for God to create a world like ours; especially
given that we might only know such a small part of life and the world (it
could be like judging a whole novel on the basis of the first pages).",3317
"""and neither are any of God's perfections and human perfections.""  
  
I disagree with that and you seem to be missing the point of analogy. Of
course God is not perfectED but he nevertheless is *literally* perfect in the
sense that he eminently possesses (eternally) all of the actualities that
creatures come to possess when they are perfected. As I said, it has long been
a standard thomistic view to say that God must *formally* possess all pure
perfections. This is related to what names we can literally predicate of God
with analogy. We don't say that God is wise just because God caused wisdom,
just like we don't say God is a cat (though he is the cause of cats and hence
has all of their actualities). Wisdom per se does not entail limitations, but
on the contrary, an increase in being.  
  
If you want to insist that this is no analogy of proper proportionality etc.
and discuss terminology, nevertheless the metaphysical point remains that God
must possess all of the actualities/perfections of its creatures (see ST I
question 4 for instance), and hence be relevantly like a moral agent unless
you think moral agency is intrinsically limiting.  
  
Again, would you say that God is not intelligent? That God is not wise? That
God is not free? Just because a perfection is found in a limited and
creaturely manner in us, that does not mean it is not a pure perfection per
se. The same goes for ""God is a moral agent"".  
  
""while the notion of moral is also rooted in the notion of custom (or more),
which in turn is intrinsically (both conceptually and existentially) dependent
upon a framework of human practices and institutions and corresponding ends
and modes of excellence""  
  
I completely disagree. To me, moral has to do with the necessary facts of
ethics. ""Moral agency"" simply refers to the capacity of beings possessed with
intellect and will (and hence freedom) to act in accordance with (or contrary
to) the necessary moral facts (such as ""torturing people is wrong/evil""). God
absolutely is a moral agent. Again, this has nothing to do with classical
theism but rather with whether ""moral agent"" is a pure perfection or not.  
  
And the point remains that when we attribute goodness, and moral goodness, to
God (and we do; and in particular, Christian believers must do that) there
must be some basic standards which God must fulfill, lest the attribution of
goodness becomes equivocal. It would not do to say ""God is most wise!!
Omniscient and perfectly knowing!"" and yet have God not actually knowing
whether we exist or not. But if God does not care about the suffering of
people (to the point where we could prima facie expect him to prevent or stop
it) then this God is not ""good"". He might be ""good"" the way a squirrel that
has all of its bodily parts is ""good"", but not good in the relevant sense that
believers profess him to be - and would, again, strike many of us as a
severely defective being (which should be impossible for the Purely Actual
source of all existence and perfection). This is all that is needed to get the
problem of evil going, however.  
  
It amazes me how some people don't realize that the ""God is not a moral agent""
line not only is metaphysically problematic for many (again, it has to do with
moral agency being a pure perfection or not, not with classical theism per se.
There are also classical theists that deny there is knowledge in God, after
all) but also only ""solves"" the problem of evil at the expense of making God
unworthy of love and worship to most believers, as well as a severely
defective and limited being to many metaphysicians.",3613

If you say that the proposition ""God exists"" is a necessary truth you are

that ""God is necessary"" cannot be proven and therefore we should consider god

And that's why the Fall theodicy is so incredibly weak, and had better be
named ""the Trap theodicy"", because it seems that God has waited just long
enough for the first time Adam did something wrong to condemn him. Moreover,
since he was the one who put the sequence there in the first place, He knew
exactly what was going to happen and when it was going to happen.  
IOW, Adam, just like the rest of us, was always doomed and has always been in

"""I think it would be closer to say that you completely misunderstand, since
almost all of what you say is tangential, not contradictory, to what I said""  
  
Well, it seemed to me that you had reduced relevant moral norms to customs and
a ""framework of human practices and institutions"", and I strongly disagree
with that. That human suffering is (ceteris paribus, to avoid soul-building
considerations) something lamentable is a necessary truth, for example.  
  
""But you are evidently fatally deceived as to the meaning of that term, since
you believe (apparently?!) that creatures ""come to possess"" these same eminent
perfections when they are perfected""  
  
They do not come to possess the same exact thing univocally (which in God
would only be one perfection), but whatever they actuality come to possess
must be pre-contained within God in at least the same degree or in a greater
way. As such, every actuality in our ""moral agency"" must be present in God,
and *not* in an inferior way. Every actuality, not every limitation. If God
possessed our perfection of Intellect in a way that made him unable to know
things, that would be absurd. It would be inferior. If God possessed our
perfection of moral agency in such a way that he could not know moral truths
(""rape is wrong"", ""human suffering is ceteris paribus bad and to be avoided"",
etc) and could not act in accordance with moral truths or practical judgment,
then it would be an inferior actuality. Which would be absurd.  
  
So you are turning the discussion into something else - I never said anything
that was incompatible with analogy, for instance; I was even quite explicit in
saying that God's formal possession of our perfections (again, see Garrigou-
Lagrange for example) does not deny analogy. And you are missing the point
that if moral agency is a pure perfection (like wisdom is), then it is also
proper to say God is a moral agent. Except if you wanna reject that God is
wise, perhaps.  
  
But if God did not know you existed or that you and I were having this
conversation, this would certainly be a problem and he would not be ""God"" in
the way that believers take him to be. And not in the sense that believers
might have mistaken views of God (thinking he has real parts for instance, or
is changing or whatever), but in a sense that would make most of them conclude
that God would (absurdly) be seriously defective, and not worthy of worship at
all.  
  
It's not that hard, actually. If God is indifferent to (e.g.) a child being
tortured to the point where he could simply not bother to do anything to stop
or prevent it, when it is in his power to do so, then God would be seriously
defective, unimpressive and unworthy of love and worship.  
  
In which case he would not be God, as God is supposed to be.  
  
But then God cannot be indifferent to that kind of stuff, i.e. prima facie, if
God exists, he should be stopping or preventing these evils, unless he has
morally sufficient reasons for not doing so (and then we're back to standard
theodicy, skeptical theism, etc. Which us theists cannot avoid.)",3096

phenomena)? Or really, how could there NOT be any aspect to ""things as they
appear to us"" that ""really are""? For instance, do they REALLY seem that way,
or is it ""just an appearance?"" How, indeed, could we speak **meaningfully**
about ""things as they seem to us"" without those things _having_
characteristics (even if only seeming so - they SEEM to have certain
characteristics, and that FACT is something _that is so_ even apart from
seeming). It is, further, utterly silly to simply posit the world of phenomena
being utterly divorced from ""things as they really are"", and then talk about
it with everyone else as if _your_ experience had ANY relationality with them
(or even their sheer existence). Your words would be (always) sheer gibberish

"Splendid! Finally an actual argument.  
  
Let’s recap: your initial claim is that the logical problem of evil provides
good philosophical reasons not to believe in the God of classical theism
because it shows there is no way to reconcile the bad things that happen to
people with “Omni” attributes we want to affirm about God.  
  
A response to this claim was then given that one possible “out” that can
preserve these divine attributes by hypothesizing that God could make
restitution to the wronged parties in the next life.  
  
You then made a bunch of irrelevant remarks about how everyone who disagrees
with you on this topic is stupid, and most people probably gave up on the
conversation. But now we actually have a non-trivial and non-circular
response! An immortal soul cannot exist that survives after death because we
don’t know how a soul interacts with the brain, so it is therefore impossible
for God to offer restitution to a person after death.  
  
Now that we have that all our of the way, ready for the philosophy? You sure?
Ok here it is:  
  
I reject your premise. An unsolved question is not a demonstration that two
concepts are incompatible.  
  
This is further justified by the arguments that Dr. Feser has made here (and
others have made elsewhere) that the mind cannot be wholly materially
determinate, and that there must be an immaterial component to our thoughts
(which is positive evidence for the soul).  
  
I conclude that the above theodicy has not been rebutted, and therefore the
problem of evil fails to demonstrate what you want to claim.",1582

“The history of Immanuel Kant's life is difficult to portray, for he had
neither life nor history. He led a mechanical, regular, almost abstract
bachelor existence in a little retired street of Königsberg, an old town on
the north-eastern frontier of Germany. I do not believe that the great clock
of the cathedral performed in a more passionless and methodical manner its
daily routine than did its townsman, Immanuel Kant. Rising in the morning,
coffee-drinking, writing, reading lectures, dining, walking, everything had
its appointed time, and the neighbors knew that it was exactly half-past three
o'clock when Kant stepped forth from his house in his grey, tight-fitting
coat, with his Spanish cane in his hand, and betook himself to the little
linden avenue called after him to this day the ""Philosopher's Walk."" Summer
and winter he walked up and down it eight times, and when the weather was dull
or heavy clouds prognosticated rain, the townspeople beheld his servant, the
old Lampe, trudging anxiously behind Kant with a big umbrella under his arm,
like an image of Providence.  
  
What a strange contrast did this man's outward life present to his
destructive, world-annihilating thoughts! In sooth, had the citizens of
Königsberg had the least presentiment of the full significance of his ideas,
they would have felt far more awful dread at the presence of this man than at
the sight of an executioner, who can but kill the body. But the worthy folk
saw in him nothing more than a Professor of Philosophy, and as he passed at
his customary hour, they greeted him in a friendly manner and set their
watches by him.”

How do you think Kant's nominalism played into his abandonment of metaphysical

History of Phil Quarterly (2015) where he notes that while Kant says little
explicitly about universals, his recent interpreters agree that he ""rejected
universals."" Oberst agrees with some nuance (trying to situate Kant in some
middle ground between nominalism and realism).  
  
Without getting into exegesis of Kant on this point, do you think nominalism
might account for his denial of metaphysical proofs? It seems to me that his
nominalism would account for this and for his epistemology as well (with
nominalism understood as the denial of universal, extra mental form). Any

make reference only to what is conditioned, to contingent things. _Ultimate_
explanation must posit the existence of something which is absolutely _un_

realissimum_ ” or most real being, would be devoid of any defect, and would be
the source of all other reality – it would possess “the _highest_ causality…
which contains primordially in itself the sufficient ground of every possible
effect” (p. 499). Naturally, it is not the likes of Zeus or Odin that Kant has
in mind, but rather the Unmoved Mover of Aristotle and Aquinas, the One of

Its been a while since i read The Laws, but in there Plato argues for:  
  
\- the existence of gods, with his cosmological argument that leads to the
existence of souls  
\- self movers - that started all other movement.  
  
\- That the gods care about us, by pointing out that a better caretaker cares
about the details of his works, so the gods do care about everything.  
  
If these arguments come before Book X, i dont remember, them the Good Workman
Argument does sound reasonable to one who accept these premises. Like Kant
moral argument, hard to dismiss if you agree with the initial premises, it is
just that atheists do not.  
  
About the problem of evil, i dont remember Plato adressing it at all*, but he
believed that:  
  
\- the soul is living in a innatural condition when stuck in the body  
  
\- that the soul is only happy when it goes to the intellectual goods, which
every soul has the potential to do.  
  
\- that after death the soul just goes eventually to another body

too simple to read Hume as a mere skeptic, full stop. True, he does try to
undermine traditional metaphysical views about substance, causation, the self,
moral value, etc. But he also emphasizes that the hold such notions have over
common sense cannot be shaken by philosophical skepticism, since they are too

"Kant was one of the world's greatest thinkers. He phillosophy foresaw quantum
mechanics.  
  
Kant did not view things-in-themselves as containing the sum of all
possibilities, and phenomena all actualities; but this duality is conformable
to Kant's metaphysics as to none other. As a contribution to the metaphysics
of possibility, the quantum mechanical wave function can easily be seen as
complementary to Kant's idea of things-in-themselves, where various kinds of
things can happen (like free will) that are not comprehensible in terms of
phenomenal reality. Kant would just have to allow that characteristics of
physical reality can intrude some depth into things-in-themselves, which he
would not have considered -- though we can also handle this by positing an
intermediate level of reality, between true unconditioned things-in-themselves
and true discrete phenomenal objects -- as Kant otherwise actually does
himself for space and time as ""pure intuitions."" The wave function straddles
the classic Kantian boundary, sharing some properties with phenomena, others,
as underlying phenomena, with things-in-themselves.  
  
Thus, where Kant would have considered all of phenomena governed by
determinism, we now see the wave function as deterministic, while the collapse
of waves into particles is random. Although chance in quantum mechanics has
often been argued as allowing for free will, a free cause is still a very
different thing from a random cause, which doesn't need mind or self or
intention. Moral freedom is thus still left among things-in-themselves. Kant
himself would have had difficulty placing randomness in his ontology, if he,
like Hume, believed that chance violates determinism. Since chance is now part
of the physics, it cannot be denied; but it also still remains a different
matter from purposive freedom.  
  
Kant's idea that space and time do not exist among things-in-themselves has
been curiously affirmed by Relativity and quantum mechanics. In Relativity,
time simply ceases to pass at the velocity of light: for photons that have
travelled to us as part of the Cosmic Background Radiation, time has stood
still for most of the history of the universe. On the other hand, quantum
mechanics now posits ""non-locality,"" i.e. physical distances, and so the
limitation of the velocity of light in Relativity, don't seem to exist. This
means that although time may apply to the wave function, space may not. The
full empirical reality of space is only found among discrete particles and
objects.  
  
This curious result is the consequence of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
Paradox, which was intended by Einstein as a reductio ad absurdum of quantum
mechanics. If, for instance, a positron and an election are both created from
an energetic photon, the conservation of angular momentum requires that one be
spinning one way, and the other the other. But the complementary spins are
equally probable for each particle. Thus, in quantum mechanical terms, the
wave functions of each particle divide without a discrete state being
determined. The particles might then separate to even cosmological distances,
but as soon as the spin of one particle is observed, the other particle must
have the opposite spin, which means that the wave function has collapsed
across those cosmological distances and caused the other particle to assume a
predictable spin. If this occurs instantaneously, it would violate the
limitation of the velocity of light in Special Relativity.  
  
This has now been shown to actually occur on the basis of Bell's Theorem (from
John Bell, 1928-1990), meaning that Quantum Mechanics does violate Special
Relativity by allowing instantaneous interactions across even cosmological
distances. However, once observed, processes must still obey Special

Down at the bottom of neoPlatonism is Parmenides. Parmenide's metaphysics gave
us the claims that change is impossible, and that the multiplicity of things
is illusionary. There is only ""the one"". The root of the metaphysical claim
that God is simple. Plato's dialogue ""Parrmenides"" is one of the oddest
writings on metaphysics ever. Parmenides claims that space and time are
illusionary and change is impossible. Where that leaves the evil of this world

that it is an irrational enterprise.  Quite the contrary. The New Atheist
supposes that all theology reflects an insufficient respect for reason. Kant
argues, by contrast, that in fact natural theology reflects an _excessive
confidence_ in the power of reason. In particular, it reflects the conviction
that ultimate explanation is possible, that the world can be made intelligible
through and through. Nor did Kant suppose that natural theology looked for
such explanation in the crudely anthropomorphic “sky daddy” of New Atheist

"Kant took the emergent sense of self of his era, and made it the seat of all
knowledge. He first promulgated the belief that it is the subject (the viewer)
that is central to knowledge, and not the object viewed. Socratics believed
that truth was a quality that existed outside of human perception. It was a
philosopher’s job to search it out. Plato, unwittingly, gave a demonstration
of this in his famous parable about shadows in a cave that we have touched on.
People are chained to a cave wall and can see only shadows thrown from objects
passing before a fire behind them. Since this is all they ever see, they will
mistake the shadows for reality. In this example, perception is not the seat
of knowledge at all, but instead a false prophet. Truth does not exist in the
perception of the person in the cave, but is an independent quality that is
outside not only the viewer’s perception, but also outside the cave itself.
Jesus took this a step further in describing truth not as a quality, but as a
god, as independent from a man’s perception as it is possible to be. Truth was
God, and came from God, and it was our job to accept God and His will for us.
Saint Paul, foremost architect of the Christian church, anticipates Kant’s
description of spiritual truth as something outside of sensory perception in I
Corinthians Chapter 2: “We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the
hidden wisdom, ... Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into
the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared”. In Paul’s view, we
don’t get knowledge of God through our senses, but “God hath revealed them
unto us by his Spirit.” Truth is truly outside of ourselves, and absolutely
outside of our perception. It must be revealed by God. “Now we have received …
the spirit which is of God; that we might know … not in the words which man’s
wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth”. In this case, a viewer’s
perception is useless, for truth can be known only through revelation to the
spirit. Kant turned this around to teach that we cannot truly know any object
outside of ourselves. All we can know is our view of that object. Thus, all
knowledge is contingent on the subject, or subjective. There is no truth that
we can find in an object, because we see that object only through our view. We
see only our piece of it. From this point, he built a philosophical system
which used scientific observation as a lens to determine what we can know, how
we can know it, and how we learn it and describe it. At the same time, Kant
held on to the notion that there may be truth that is outside of our ability
to observe its phenomena, and so prove it. In fact, Kant felt he had proved
that there were phenomena that did not have any observable traces, and so
could not be known. He used the origin of matter in the universe as an
example. It is here. It had to get here from somewhere, but where did it come
from? Everything we can sense has an action and reaction. Everything has a
start. So, what about matter? In short, Kant proved that we see things
subjectively, but went on to show that this does not mean that objective truth
does not exist, but only that we cannot observe objective truth, since we
cannot observe the object itself. I will give you a CliffsNotes version to say
that Kant built a science-based philosophy that still left room for Saint
Paul’s belief that God’s truth could not come to us through our senses, but
only through revelation.",3476
" _It's hard for me to even understand why you would want to make such a

The motivation stems from Kant's attempt to respond to Humean skepticism. Kant
thinks metaphysical principles (e.g. every event must have a cause) can only
be justified in virtue of their expressing conditions of the possibility of
experience, viz. the conditions objects must satisfy in order to be objects of
experience _for us_. But this suggests the need to distinguish between two
says of considering objects, namely in relation to subjects with our forms of
cognition (things as they appear to us) and independently of such relations
(things as they are in themselves).

justify induction, and in part because the deliverances of modern physics are
hardly less abstruse and remote from common life than the rationalist
speculations he was so keen to shoot down. A Humean must also give up a
rationalistic ethics, given that, as he famously holds, there is nothing
contrary to _reason_ (but only to the sentiments of the average person) to
prefer that the entire world be destroyed than that one should suffer a
scratch to his finger. Humean arguments entail a pessimism about the powers of
human reason that doesn’t sit well with scientism or with dogmatic and

a critique of traditional metaphysics and natural theology. However, in Kant’s
view this entailed no doubts about the rational foundations of morality or of

It will depend on the school, but most dualists i can think of can account for

Take for instance the more platonic/dharmic/spiritist view that the soul is a
substance whose nature is other than the body and that not only has no
necessary conection with it but is actually weakened by being stuck with it.
This is pretty straightfoward here: the soul is stuck with the body
limitations and so its natural capacities will be worser on a crappier body.  
  
Take now the cartesian view were the soul is a substance whose nature is other
than the body but is made to function with the body. Here the sould and the
body must function together to it to work well, so a bad body will make the
soul less capable of functioning.  
  
Now take the thomistic view were the soul is the form of the body. Here things
also work well, for the body is responsable for sense data, memory and
imagination and the intellect(that the soul is responsable for) needs sense
data everytime it needs to function*, so if the body do not work well, them
the sould is screwed.  
  
So it seems that the forms of dualism defended by philosophers, at least with
a religious mindset, can work well on this case. The only type of dualism i
can't see explaining it is the one you see on most fiction with superhumans or
magic were someone can turn into a fly or a bird, say, and still think. If the
soul can work well on these situations, brain damage should be easy.

Well, Kant starts with the humean thesis that sense data can only generate
contigent knowledge. He quickly realized that empiricism is dumb, for we do
have necessary knowledge, so he was a sort of rationalist early. Necessary
knowledge comes from reason.  
  
But them Kant understood that sense data is pretty much how we have
information about reality, so if our necessary knowledge does not come from
the senses them it either:  
  
1\. Has no basis on reality and is mere play with definitions(which smart
empiricists do defend).  
  
2\. Come from something else.  
  
The prussian argued that at least mathematics is a sort of necessary knowledge
that is not created by language, so 2 won. His answer was that we can know
some truths about how we happen to organize sense data by analysing the
necessary conditions to our experience to it to be how it is. For instance,
every experience we have is in time, it has a sucession and all that, so we
can derive several truths about that(inded, mathematics would have his origin
on the forms of time and space).  
  
And so, by knowing this structure we could show that every possible experience
we could have need to obey a certain structure and so gather several truths
about how things appear to us. This method is worthless to know things we cant
empirically know, though.",1531

I have no right to dismiss or reject an idea.  
  
I also disagree with the problem statement and the premise that the solution
involves some kind of massive payout by the so-called 1%. First, a wealth
disparity between racial groups is not per se a problem to be solved. Second,
if it is a problem, it isn't necessarily the result of any kind of racism in
any tangible sense. It could be cultural, and I claim that the problem is
largely cultural (for example, Thomas Sowell, for example, opines that the
disintegration of the black family beginning in the 1960s, often assisted by
well-meaning social programs, has had a devastating effect on black Americans;
I would also mention ideologies of perpetual powerlessness and victimhood that
both demoralize and divert energy away from constructive activity toward
ineffectual grievance and blame). Third, even if it were racist, I don't see
what the rich have to do with it unless you can show that they employ racist
policies specifically to impoverish certain racial groups (the targeting of
the rich under the pretext that they benefit from a rigged system is the kind
of sloppy and unjust rationalization I would expect from a Marxist who foments
class conflict). Fourth, throwing money at problems is precisely what (per
Sowell) created much of the problems we're seeing today. NGOs, often run by
wealthy philanthropists, offer a relevant example of how funneling money and
free goods into causes can cause more damage than it solves (the destruction
of the Nigerian cotton and textile industry through mitumba, the destruction
of Haitian farming through free rice given long after a crisis has passed,
even something like the effect of TOMS on African shoe manufacturing and
repair). I'm not saying *charitable* work cannot help, but I would be very
suspicious of any ""philanthropic"" or even government-mandated solution given
their track record. More importantly, no amount of money can solve the basic
problem which, again, is cultural. Maybe Catholic missionaries could play a
role here. The Catholic Church is, after all, what turned even the pig-chasing
savages of Europe into something resembling a civilization. Only after the
Church has given structure to the mission to lift black America out of
spiritual and moral decay and, secondarily, poverty, does talk of money make
sense because only then can it be used and allocated prudently and with care.

slavery represented by the African slave trade was intrinsically evil. The
popes condemned this consistently from the beginning. Now, it’s true that
there were a lot of people who simply ignored the teaching but that was indeed
the teaching. People often have this false impression…that somehow the Church
is a late comer to this. Well, no. In fact, the Church has been consistently
condemning what’s called chattel slavery – or the treatment of other human

With a wealth of impressively documented scholarship, Adiele demonstrates that
the Popes actively supported the enslavement of Africans and the Transatlantic
slave trade for nearly four centuries. He writes: ""Even in the face of
numerous protests made by some anti-slavery proponents in both Europe and
America against the continued unjust enslavement of Black Africans, none of
the popes of the Church beginning from the renaissance papacy in the fifteenth
century, throughout the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries and up to the
first three decades of the nineteenth century ever remembered to hearken to
those voices of protests so as to extend their fatherly concern towards Black
Africans laboring under the chains of Transatlantic slavery... Even in the
sixteenth century precisely in 1537 during the papacy of pope Paul III, when
the papacy at last began to show interest in the sufferings of peoples held
under the bondage of slavery by condemning the enslavement of the Indians of
the West Indies, the Black Africans were left out and ignored in this papal
interest in protecting those under enslavement... The papacy showed her
concern for Black Africans in 1814 and 1823 respectively only at the
motivation of the British government and only on the condition that the
British government will help the Church to recover her lost Papal States which
were taken away from her by the Napoleonic invasion and occupation of the
Papal States in 1808.""

argument.",3055

Okay, this does not work. Phil is not proposing this idea because he happens
to like minorities. He is proposing it because these folks are on a quite
crappy situation when compared to white folks. I understand that a group
facing inferior living conditions, oportunities etc by injust factors that we
can solve is a injustice that should be tackled in order to the common good of
the place to be better realized.

as a matter of public police is necessarily racist.  ",850
"Thanks to all for your discussion of a particular specific, bold, plan of
action. I find any such analysis to be superior to vague claims such as
""racism is bad, and isn't that sad"" which seem to dominate so much of our
culture's discussion of race.  
  
It's entirely reasonable to challenge, and perhaps dismiss, any particular
plan of action. But the way to do that is to replace one plan with another,
not to merely content ourselves with rejectionism.  
  
What typically happens is that somebody will suggest some plan, everyone else
will immediately starting proclaiming it wrong, while offering no plan of
their own, and so nothing happens, and centuries of racial divide continues.  
  
For myself, I see no good reason why the top 1% of our society, who control at
least a third of the nation's wealth, and are those who have most benefited
from America's rigged system, should not lift up those who have been most
oppressed by it. Such an effort need not cost the average person a nickel, so
I see no good reason to sweep such an opportunity away with a wave of our

great.",1162

" _I've grown weary of abstract discussion of racial_  
  
What defines ""race"". It has had different meanings at different times, and in
different contexts.  
  
_of racial issues_  
  
Which issues? No, **specifically** which issues? Those of injustice? What
about injustices commited by blacks at blacks? Oh, do you mean injusticed
committed by blacks on whites? Shoot, reverse that, I mean by whites on
blacks? What about all the other kinds of racial injustices?

What if only SOME of us are serious about it? Can we who are serious overcome
the intent of those who don't want it changed? What about democracy?  
  
_we'd be focused on specific, bold, plans_  
  
I have a specific, bold plan: every white man marries a black woman, and every
black man marries a white woman. In 2 generations, there will be no racial
divide at all.  
  
_how about totally free education_  
  
Mere ""education"" doesn't do it, if (a) the recipient isn't willing or able to
**receive** it. (Free) public high schools have enormous drop-out rates in
some areas, (mostly by minorities but not solely) - they theoretically have a
free education in front of them, but they decline it. If you re-make _college_
education to meet the standards of public schools, you'll get the same result.  
  
_Specific, bold, measurable plan of action with a defined vision of success._  
  
If you want to define success in such a narrow way, you guarantee failure in
respect of _other kinds_ of success. But aside from that: if your attempt were
to meet with ANTI-success (say, increased income gap), would you then **re-
pay** the people you took the money from to pay for that effort? (Because,
after all, it would have been demonstrated to be unjust.) And...whose money
would you use to do that?  
  
If you want to state a measurable outcome as ""success"", then you have to
equally identify what constitutes a ""failure"" of the attempt. And you have to
account for the _implications_ of failure, social and otherwise. Which means:
""free"" might not, actually, be free.",2099
" _In the American context, how about totally free education (books, tuition,
room and board, everything) at every level for historically oppressed
minorities, paid for by the super-rich, and continued until such time as the
wealth gap between whites and minorities was erased._  
  
Amazing how so many plans to erase a racial divide (which must always be
illicit and evil, not at all natural) inevitably turns into a not-so-subtle
payday for people. There's a reason why ""free"" room and board, tuition, and
education is paired with the requirement that it be ""paid for"" by someone
else: because it's not free. And it's not going to be the super-rich paying
either.  
  
If the concern is to provide education as cheaply and freely as possible,
maybe we should consider price caps on tuition. The fact is, with the modern
internet, we are capable of providing a massive amount of education for dirt
cheap compared to what traditional, outdated institutions currently offer. In
fact, we already do so: see Coursera, or all kinds of other online options.  
  
But this solution, while clearly viable and even superior to the traditional
alternative, would not enrich the bloated, inefficient education system. And,
for all the cries of racism and inequality, circumventing that kind of payout
is not a price the loudest antiracists are willing to pay.  
  
That's one of the real problems: at some point we have to be willing to ask
whether the person crying ""racism!"" actually has a point, or if they're full
of it. They often are. There's a real conversation that needs to be had.",1580
"N.b. I am the Anon that wrote the above post responding to @Infinite Growth (I

To make clear what I meant by recent politics, take, for example, Act H.R.1226
and Senate Act S.447 through which certain organizations, with the aid of the
US government, are trying to extract massive sums of money from the Polish
state for so-called heirless property that once belonged to Jews. According to
both Polish law and the general legal principle followed virtually everywhere,
property without a legal heir reverts to the state after the death of its
owner. If a legal heir exists, he is free to pursue restitution like everyone
else through the Polish courts. The absurd position of certain groups is that
the Polish government should treat these cases in a extraordinary way and
offer broad restitution anyway, not to any heirs, because of course they don't
exist, but to organizations and people who are not legal heirs. And recall
that this was property held by Polish citizens as Polish Jews were Polish
citizens. By reinforcing the notion that Poles, as a corporate body, are
guilty of collaborating in the criminal program of the Nazis, it becomes
easier to make claims on the Polish state. Heirless property, combined with a
sprinkle of customary special pleading, misrepresentation, and the thought-
diffusing VIP pass that is the word ""Holocaust"", provides a convenient
opportunity for unscrupulous organizations to illegitimately extract billions
of dollars from the Polish state by exploiting the emotional force of a
historical tragedy. Perhaps such organizations should instead direct their
claims to Berlin as the German state is responsible for handling the
restitution of Jewish property lost through actions of the Nazi regime. As I
mentioned already, the Poles have not received a dime of restitution for the
absolute obliteration of their country, its cities, its cultural heritage, not
to mention the torture, exploitation, and deaths of millions of its citizens,
Jew and gentile alike.",2062

Well, here's what Adiele's book, which I quoted from has to say on the subject
(see p. 469):  
  
""In the course of making this investigation, the basic question that guided
this work is: Did the popes of the Church actively involve themselves in the
enslavement of Black Africans during the Transatlantic slave trade? At the end
of this investigation, the findings from the historical sources available to
this study unfortunately tended to answer this basic question in the positive.
This slave trade was not only supported and approved by the Catholic  
Church but also received the blessings of the popes for a good number of
reasons.""

Black African enslavement.""

hours looking through his book online last night, before commenting on it. And
yes, I'm pretty confident of my interpretation of the author's views, as I
managed to skim through most of his book, focusing especially on the papacy.  
  
You might also want to read what the author says about the curse of Ham on pp.
166-191. It was endorsed by Pope Pius IX as late as 1873.  
  
Re chattel slavery: Aizen, if your only quarrel is with the kind of slavery
that claims to own a man's soul as well as his body, then I respectfully
submit that your claim is untenable in practice. The soul cannot be free
unless the body is. You cannot coherently claim to own a man's labor without
claiming to own the man himself. As Elizabeth Anscombe famously put it in her
inaugural lecture as Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge University in 1971,
titled, ""Causality and Determination"": ""My actions are mostly physical
movements; if these physical movements are physically predetermined by
processes which I do not control, then my freedom is perfectly illusory."" And
I might add: ""if my physical movements are determined by the whims of a slave-
master whom I cannot control, then my freedom is perfectly illusory.""",2548
"@Infinite Growth, there's that ignorant and vicious trope again. I'll bite,
though this is a digression as my point was to show that even much more
tangible claims toward restitution remain unaddressed if we wish to talk
restitution.  
  
Were there Poles who committed crimes during WWII, who went along with Nazi,
or Soviet, crimes? Obviously. I feel silly even having to state the obvious
because this is something that follows not from empirical fact, but from the
general proposition that the moral status of the actions of individuals during
wartime does not conform strictly to the divide of the front line. There were
righteous Germans and righteous Russians and wicked Poles. So what? Judas
betrayed Christ, but the Apostles on the whole or as a corporate body were not
agents of the Sanhedrin. We can say the same about Jews who betrayed both
their fellow Jews and committed crimes against gentile Poles, but we rarely
talk about those, so why the special pleading here?  
  
As a matter of empirical fact, we must remember things like:  
  
1\. The Polish state never collaborated with the Nazis. Compare that with
other European governments. This refusal to collaborate, and the formation of
Europe's largest resistance, happened at enormous cost. This, in addition to
Nazi crimes against the populace.  
2\. Even the number of only those Poles recognized by Yad Vashem outstrips the
combined number of people recognized from all other nations combined.
Proportion and scale matter.  
3\. The penalties for aiding Jews were uniquely and incomparably severe in
Poland (involving the execution of the person aiding, his family, maybe
neighbors, etc). And yet, point (2).  
4\. Poland was home to something like 80% of world Jewry at the time of the
war and the majority of the world's Jews for centuries. Any occurrence of
antipathy (and don't forget Jewish bigotry, which did exist) at the time of
the war was driven by economic, but also cultural, political, social, and
historical factors, not racial hatred. That is, there was no impulse to
exterminate any group and any crimes committed were isolated incidents of
criminal opportunism taken during the chaos of wartime, not systematic
programs of liquidation or some broad expression of national hatred. There
were also incidents where Poles were forced under threat of death to
participate in Nazi operations, incidents that some Jewish authors have
grotesquely misrepresented either maliciously or through incompetence (e.g.,
Jan Gross).

f(x) = f(y) because you have limited the context of the ""is equal"" itself. But
it doesn't hold in every respect if x is not the same as y in every respect.
If x is ""8"" and y is ""4 + 4"" and z is ""3 + 5"", then they are not the same in

contexts. This way of talking entails no contradictions (or at least any
obvious ones) and is especially useful in mathematics though; part of the
reasons are certainly contingent and reflect the way how mathematicians are
trained, but I would contend that they also reflect a deep intuition.
Mathematical objects are simple in the sense that their identity conditions
are sharp and clearly delineated -- they are the furthest removed from the
material. Virtually all of mathematics can be formalized in ZFC, possibly with
some extra large cardinal axioms; *equality* itself can be defined in terms of
the other primitives (in symbols: x = y iff forall z, z e x <=> z e y). In
this setting, we have: (1) *everything* is a set and (2) *everything* can be
constructed bottom up from the empty set via (possibly transfinite) iteration.
This is a large amount of reduction and simplification, yielding a powerful
framework. But to circle back to the criticisms, it also has its downsides.
Now suddenly, it make senses to ask the non-sensical question if the number 5
is an element of the number 1023. This question has a definite truth value but
its value depends on the specific, non-essential details of the construction
of the natural numbers in ZFC.",2648

"Hi Mister Geocon and Oktavian,  
  
Belief in the Curse of Ham has a long Catholic pedigree. Most of the following
quotations are taken from Adiele's book.  
  
Several Church Fathers (e.g. St. Basil of Caesarea, St. John Chrysostom, St.
Ambrose, St. Augustine of Hippo) all taught that the human institution of
slavery had its origin in Ham's sinfulness. They did not link this to Africa.
However, St. Jerome disturbingly refers to ""Ethiopians"" (Kushites) as ""black
and cloaked in the filth of sin,"" adding: ""At one time we were Ethiopians in
our vices and sins. How so? Because our sins had blackened us.""  
  
Surprisingly, the first text to explicitly link the curse of Ham to Black
Africans was the Babylonian Talmud, completed around 600 AD.  
  
In the tenth century, Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria (877-940) was the
first Christian Church leader to identify Black Africans as being among those
afflicted by the Curse of Ham:  
  
“Cursed be Ham, and may he be servant of his brothers...He himself and his
descendants, who are the Egyptians, the Negroes, the Ethiopians, and it is
said the  
Barbari.”  
  
According to the famous Christian geographical work ""Cursor Mundi"" (1300
A.D.), Noah's son Shem and his descendants were freemen who dwelt in Asia.
Japhet and his descendants were nobles and knights who came to live in Europe,
while ""Ham, the accursed"" and his descendants were slaves who were sent to
Africa.  
  
In the 15th century, the famous Portuguese chronicler Gomes Eannes de Azurara
(1410-1474) appealed to the writings of a 12th century archbishop of Toledo,
Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada (1170-1247) to support his contention that Black
Africans were doomed to servitude because they were the accursed descendants
of Ham:  
  
""The servitude of non-Muslim Moors (West Africans) resulted from the curse,
which,  
after the Deluge, Noah laid upon his son Ham, cursing him in this way: 'that
his race  
should be subject to all the other races of the world. And from his race these
Blacks are descended,' as wrote the Archbishop Don Roderick of Toledo and
Josephus in his Book on the Antiquities of the Jews, and Walter, with other
authors who have spoken of the generations of Noah from the time of his going
out of the Ark.""  
  
In the 15th century, Dominican Friar Johannes Annius of Viterbo (1432-1502)
wrote that the curse of Ham forced him into exile in Africa: “As a result of
his sin, Ham is exiled to Africa.”  
  
In the 18th century, French biblical scholar and Benedictine abbot Augustine
Calmet (1672-1757) wrote in a work titled “Dictionary of the Holy Bible”
(1722): “Noah assigned to Ham the nations of Africa. The occasion of the color
of his sons was that Noah being one day asleep discovered his nakedness, and
Ham passed that way without covering him; on which accounts his descendants
are born with black complexion, and the gift of the prophecy was taken from
them.”  
  
In the 19th century, John England, the first Catholic bishop of Charleston,
USA, wrote in a letter to US Secretary of State John Forsyth (1780-1841) that
the enslavement of Black Africans was entirely lawful, because of the sin
committed by their ancestor, Ham:  
  
“Since every Catholic must accept Adam's fall as an essential ingredient in
the human condition, he should likewise believe that it certainly was not then
against the divine law for Shem and Japheth to use the services of the Black
race, since their progenitor had been cursed by God for his sinful conduct.”  
  
Finally, Pope Pius IX issued a Prayer for the Conversion of Africa through the
Office of the Sacred Congregation of Rites on October 2, 1873, in which he
declared: ""“Let us pray for the most wretched Ethiopians in Central Africa,
that Almighty God may at length remove the curse of Cham from their hearts,
and grant them the blessing to be found only in Jesus Christ, our God and
Lord."" This prayer came with a 300-day indulgence.  
  
Is it ""kind of bonkers"" to say that the Curse of Ham was a major influence on
Catholic thought? I think not.",4040
"I wasn't trying to exonerate them. I'm more than happy to talk about their
complicity, in fact. The Poles were victims of the Holocaust. If someone wants

"Phil,  
  
Personally, I reject the conviction that commonly understood racism is some
overwhelming evil and the root cause of a seemingly ever-expanding list of
social ills to begin with. Pointing at differences in outcomes along racial
lines is not sufficient to establish that. It's extremely popular to regard it
as established beyond reasonable doubt, I grant. I'm willing to go against the
grain there.  
  
But what's interesting here is that, in spite of my view, I nevertheless *did*
offer an alternative -- after all, increased access to education is a worthy
goal itself. But you seem to have overlooked my suggestions. Perhaps it was
invisible precisely because it involved no massive wealth transfer to teachers
and activists. And if that's the reason it didn't even register, well. Doesn't
that say a lot?  
  
Incidentally, I have a very good reason, as a non-super-rich person, to
nevertheless oppose this plan that would supposedly target, exclusively, the
super-rich: if push comes to shove and it's decided that taking wealth for

"It's a grift, absolutely. And I think it's an even deeper grift than that, and
not exclusive to the left.  
  
But what bothers me about this particular subject is that there has been an
absolutely, positively *insane* advancement in the ease of education in the
past couple of decades. In less than a single lifetime we went from books
almost exclusively being available on dead trees to having copies of massive
libraries able to fit in our pockets. And not just books, but videos,
interactive instructions, and more. We are swimming in a disgusting abundance
of free and accessible education which can be accessed for next to nothing, at
will, 24/7, anywhere on the planet. Education has never been easier and more
attainable than ever before for everyone in the world. Especially for English
speakers.

_right_ in that context. We might come up with a parallel word or phrase to
use, I suppose, but even that wouldn't eradicate that ""natural right"" still

natural law is critical, and since ""natural law"" isn't going anywhere as a

distinctions.",843
"The ""language"" certainly started long before. It's inseparable from the
Christian idea of human personality as something towards which society is
oriented. The article mentioned in this post is about this Christian concept
of human rights. It's very clear in St, Thomas but less so in Aristotle, for
whom natural law was not necessarily universal and timeless. The teleological
approach is also lacking in Aristotle's purely secularist view. Chesterton was
surely right when (referring to philosophies of the Far East and Asia) he said
that nothing had been thought up there which the Mediterranean had not already
thought of. Standing apart from all this, the Christian view - going back to
the Patriarchs of the OT, is unique.",728
"This is the right approach, however, from what I've read so far it's
overcomplicated by Aristotle and Aquinas. The Greek model for human rights is
not universal but tied to the idea of AUTOCHTHONY and would JUSTIFY chattel
slavery.  
Paul addressed AUTOCHTHONY directly in his Mars hill discourse in Acts 17
countering the dispute concerning birth from a particular area to one BLOOD,
in law a common human consanguinity which having the evidence of mixed races
or ethnicities is evidence of common humanity due therefore common equity
(dikaiosune, see Aristotle BOOK 5 NICHOMACHEAN ETHICS).  
He then established the common observation that in one theos all live and move
and have being which relates back to the first observation that they had many
gods each of which protected certain classes of rights when given obeisance.
The unknown one Theos being the god upon whom even the other gods demiurgos
we're dependent.  
Then he established the ideal judge who could advocate the natural rights of
those in the image of the invisible Theos who is not in the image or location
chosen by men but has established equity in the image of God in the god man in
whom are all actual subjective rights obvious by natural law made objective
because HE will judge in that equity, justice, righteousness, dikaiosune,
mishpat and God has given proof of this by raising him from the dead
signifying he is eternal and has the power over life and death for all in his
image.  
Paul draws this human rights argument directly from the old testament
description of messiah the Christ not Greek philosophy he has simply explained
it so that greeks could understand it. This is the same structure used in the
prologue to John's Gospel, beginning with IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE LOGOS, the
logos became flesh, that becoming flesh gave us equity and the authority to
claim the title of an inheritance of rights i.e THE SONS OF GOD, our duty
then, his law is to love and protect the legitimate rights of others as we
love and protect our own rights, knowing these rights came from God by grace
and the truth concerning the fact of the matter that is the Christ.  
I don't see how philosophy can improve on this although it may help to
understand it, but it doesn't improve upon but rather is corrected by the new
testament based on the two great commandments with respect to God's rights and
our rights in common as neighbors and the explanation in the prophets such as
ISAIAH who goes into great detail on the subject of equity of rights in the
human image of God YHVHJESUS.

" _But he looks around and sees actually good people, people with special
abilities and excellence, and he realizes how unworthy he is of Heaven,_  
  
In addition to the replies above, I want to focus on this notion. First,
""special abilities"" **never was** any aspect of being ""qualified"" for heaven.
Take, for example, St. Peter. If you examine his behavior in the Gospels and
Acts, you find a guy - a mere fisherman - who constantly puts his foot in his
mouth, who berates God, and who runs away from a friend in great need.
Eventually, he did clean up his act, but - as with all the saints - he
attributed this to **favors he was granted out of God's overflowing gifts** ,
not out of his own merit.  
  
""and excelllence"". Again the ONLY excellence that technically qualifies is the
**love of God** by which you act rightly in all your acts, and this is (again)
always due to God's beneficent favor, not our own merit. All we can claim is
to have _remained in cooperation_ with said grace, rather than repudiating it.
St. Francis said that greater good would be found in a man merely picking a
piece of straw out of the road, if done with perfect love of God, than in a
great many great sacrifices suffered with imperfect love.  
  
What you are confusing in ""excellences"" is the acts of HEROIC virtues by which
the Church _locates and confirms canonized_ saints, with the actual excellence
needed, perfect love. But the life of a nun in a contemplative cloister, who
spends her entire life _just FOLLOWING THE RULE_ with perfect charity, (and
without any call by God to endure situations demanding heroic virtue), has
just as much claim on being in heaven as some highly acclaimed saint who
performed many wonders and miracles with love of God, or a saint who bore
great visible sufferings for love of God. The Church never _expects_ to
canonize all those who go to heaven: she uses the test of heroic virtue as an
empirical source of _evidence for_ the required love of God, but she does not
deny the same love might persist in many who do not demonstrate it VISIBLY in
great events.  
  
And if you die in the state of grace but highly imperfect in your love of God,
your time in Purgatory will correct that, and you will get to heaven with
perfect love of God - just like the acclaimed and cannonized saints.",2316
"_Natural law theory in the Aristotelian-Thomistic (A-T) tradition is grounded
in a metaphysics of essentialism and teleology, and in turn grounds a theory
of natural rights. This chapter offers a brief exposition of the metaphysical
ideas in question, explains how the A-T tradition takes a natural law moral
system to follow from them, and also explains how in turn the existence of
certain basic natural rights follows from natural law. It then explains how
the teleological foundations of natural law entail not only that natural
rights exist, but also that they are limited or qualified in certain crucial
ways. The right to free speech is used as a case study to illustrate these
points. Finally, the chapter explains the sense in which the natural rights
doctrine generated by A-T natural law theory amounts to a theory of human
rights, specifically_.",857

"_For God, deliberative liberty – any “could have been otherwise,” any
arbitrary decision among opposed possibilities – would be an impossible defect
of his freedom. God does not require the indeterminacy of the possible in
order to be free… And in the calculus of the infinite, any tension between
freedom and necessity simply disappears; there is no problem to be resolved
because, in regard to the transcendent and infinite fullness of all Being, the
distinction is meaningless… And it is only insofar as God is not a being
defined by possibility, and is hence infinitely free, that creation inevitably
follows from who he is_. _This in no way alters the truth that creation, in
itself, “might not have been,” so long as this claim is understood as a modal
definition, a statement of ontological contingency, a recognition that
creation receives its being from beyond itself and so has no necessity
intrinsic to itself._",922
"It is still not true, however, that Hart's universalism (or his arguments for
it in TASBS) require or entail necessitarianism.  
  
To recall: from the impossibility of persons being damned, it doesn't follow
that God must CREATE&save persons. When saying it is necessary that God must
save all, the necessity in question can be perfectly conditional - if God
creates persons (which can be true contingently), God must save all of them
(necessary).

should realize that his argument does not succeed, because the position he

And now, the proposition that God is outside of time. This propsition was
posed by Augustine in his ""Confessions - Book XI.""  
It became an idea adopted by most if not all classical theologians from
Boethius to Aquinas.  
  
For God, there is no real past, present, or future, to God all is Now. God can
directly experience every part of that Big Now. Difficuly one is if there is
no real past, there can be no before, now, afterwards. Creation entails before
creation, creation, after creation. One might argue God is an immanent
sustainer of this eternal creation.  
But that entails all ever was and is and will be as it is eternally. Why then
does a perfectly good God sustain horrendous evil and suffering?  
  
And we are baack to the problem off long befoe these evils, God knew some
13.75 billion years ago these evils would happen. A trillion years ago, God
knew this horrific evil in this Universe would exist. An googleplex years ago,
God could experience this segment of the Big Now and witness this evil and
suffering.  
  
If we claim God created this world, God chose this Universe with all its evils
and we get no free will. God gets the blame. If we argue God merely sustains
this Universe, God gets the blames for all suffering and evil. If God from any
point in eternity knew the state of what we percieve of Now, that is immutable
and unchangable.

back to the issue of why God allows so much evil and suffering? Not matter
what God's Big Now is, God gets the blame.

state of Now and God would know what that final, unchangable Now is.

"I emphasize this because, in at least some of the remarks Hart makes in reply
to Rooney, he seems to _deny_ that he thinks that God creates of necessity. He
asks: “[W]here did I ever suggest God was prompted by a necessity beyond
himself – or even within himself?” And he says that “I’ve always maintained
that ‘necessity’ is not a meaningful concept in relation to God,” and indeed
that “creation is not necessary for God.” On the other hand, he _also_ says
that “creation follows _necessarily_ from who God freely is”; that “it is
_impossible_ that God – the Good as such – would not create”; and that “God as
the good _cannot fail_ to be… diffusive” by creating. And these statements
entail that God _does_ create of necessity as the term “necessity” is
standardly used. And again, the remarks in _You Are Gods_ entail it too.",829

willing to create the world....What is at issue is rather this: Is there

That is not the issue. Hart agrees that God could refrain from creating were
there good reasons to so choose, but creation nevertheless is inevitable
because there are no good reasons not to create. Nothing extrinsic to God
gives God a reason not to create, and God’s nature certainly contains no such
reason. Therefore, God’s love is the controlling reason that entails creation,
for there exists nothing in competition with love that could sway God’s will
against choosing to create.

randomness into the divine will.",870
"This response manages to involve several basic errors. First, your first
comment was (as it needs to be) about good reasons, not compelling reasons.
The two are not the same at all, even in our case. Second, 'compelling' reason
is a metaphor; nobody is literally compelled by any reasons, which would
require that reasons be efficient causes. All 'compelling reason' means is
that it was a reason good enough due to its intrinsic merits that one acted on
it. Because of this, while it is true that our creation shows that God had no
compelling reason not to create, it is trivially true -- all it is saying is
that God's making choice A shows that He didn't decide to act on the intrinsic
merits of any reasons He might have had for choice B. It doesn't tell us
anything about whether He had good reasons for choice B. Third, the response
is irrelevant because the claim in question is ""nothing in God's nature
contains a reason not to create"".

"You want full message, fine here.  
-I read your ""The experience of God"" book twice and I have some questions regarding it.  
First is a minor nitpick (And I mean no offence for saying this) but I feel
you have a tendency to use too many $10 words. Case in point; you use the word
""quotidian"" at least 5 times that I can remember, when that word is almost
never better than its friendly companions ""daily"", ""everyday"", ""ordinary"", and
""commonplace"". Now having a large vocabulary isn't a bad thing, but a flagrant
use of obscure words made it very difficult to understand your point.  
My second problem is your concept of God and how you define it. Your
definition of God is that in trying to elevate Him to the loftiest heights,
heights truly befitting the magnificence of God, I feel you have reduced Him
to empty concepts/platitudes, both completely meaningless and as uninspiring
as mathematical axioms. What could it mean to say God is existence, or
consciousness, or bliss, or any of the other abstract concepts that one often
hears thrown about by other religious believers: love, truth, the alpha and
the omega, and so on? One might as well argue that God is electricity,
gravity, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Of course, this would be
ludicrous. Who would seek ecstatic union with the weak nuclear force, or pray
to electricity, or find solace in the presence of gravity? But slap a poetic,
inspirational-sounding abstraction on God (being, truth, beauty, etc.), and
suddenly the whole thing gains a veneer of credibility it hasn't earned.  
The meaninglessness of your idea of God culminates in your assertion that God
must be simple, unable to “possess distinct parts, or even distinct
properties” (p.128), and, as eternal, He can’t be subject to change either
(time being a measure of change – not to mention the fact that change
indicates a movement from potentiality to actuality, whereas God is pure
actuality (another meaningless concept)). What can possibly be left over after
one has removed distinct parts/properties and the ability to change?  
Lastly you defend all of this by claiming that any other way of thinking about
God is guilty of anthropomorphism; the tendency to re-make God in our own
image and likeness. The charge of anthropomorphism is undeniably valid when
people try to convince us that a being even the tiniest bit like what you
describe, God cares about what you do in the privacy of your own bedroom, or
desires human worship, or takes sides favouring one equally petty, narrow-
minded tribe over another, but it is far from obvious that the claim that God
isn’t subject to change or lacks distinguishing properties fares any better.
The problem here is to explain how this God can be as transcendent as you

metaphysical change in him” (p.137). God therefore can’t act in the world, nor
can He be free, you say?

involves no temporal change within him. His freedom… [consists in] the
infinite liberty with which he manifests himself in the creation he wills from
everlasting.” (p.139)  ",3487

Whatever will we do with your devastating criticisms that no one else has ever
considered before?  
  
I have carefully examined a lot of classical theologians on this
point.Augustine, Boethius, Ansalm, William of Okham, Duns Scotus, Aquinas,
Molina and others. And some of the enormous modern secondary literature.  
  
Augustine assert that though God foresees all he does not cause all. Boethius
claims that as a man sees something, that man does not cause what he sees.
Thus God sees future events but likewise does not cause them. And on and on it
goes. Everybody is indeed wrong  
  
The particular argument I posted is not answered by the nearly 1600 years of
theologians trying to explain the issue of God's foreknowledge and free will.
Not until Luther's ""Bondage Of The Will"" did the issue of this become a
problem.  
  
Late in his life after the Pelagian affair Augustine gave up on free will,
which was followed by Calvin, Luther et all.  
  
I am sure that somewhere somebody else has made the argument I have, but I
have yet to see anybody that has among the theologian community.  
  
The key concep I wrote about is if Go d decides to create a Universe, God must
choose an initial states of creation. And that we are told by centuries of
theologians God foresees the future. Based on biblical claims God does that.  
Now all I do is follow these claims to their logical conclusion. No classical
theologians had the wit to notice this problem. Today's answer from theists is
that has all been answered long ago by classical theists. This is not true.  
  
And Augustin's idea God is outside of time is an idea just as bad, with the
same issue at its heart.

For it cannot be possibly the case that God both knows something beforehand,

That God infallibly foreknows the future is explicit in the Bible and is a
feature of classical theism. So hard determinism is entailed. I am not
""smuggling"" anything into my post. I am noting the explicit claims of
classical theism based on Biblical claims that are clear, and unmistakable.

foreknowledge of the future entails severe theological difficulties.

"In short, all sides agree that God is not compelled to create by anything
outside him, that he cannot will evil, and that his will is not arbitrary or
unintelligible. What is at issue is rather this: Is there anything _internal_
to the divine nature that entails that God _could not possibly_ have refrained
from creating the world? Hart says there is, and Fr. Rooney and I (and, we
claim, the mainstream Christian tradition in general) say that there is not.",459
"Even if we look at Eric Perl's treatment of Plotinus's so-called 'necessary
emmanation' we see that there is an aspect of necessity involved in it. Perl
says on pg. 50 of Theophany, ""The necessity of procession, therefore, is in no
sense a limitation on the One, but rather an expression of his absolute
freedom from any limiting condition whatsoever."" He's clearly denying that the
One is constrained by any 'condition,' but that is something the Thomist would
also accept. The 'necessity' refers not to the any external condition, but his
pure productivity itself. As Perl says, ""For if the One might not produce
being, then his productive activity would be distinct from himself and he
would be condition by a relation to his product.""  
  
Why is this relevant? Well, one of the arguments of Perl's book is a situating
of Pseudo-Dionysius within a Plotinian and Procline metaphysics. So, Perl goes
on to state that ""For Dionysius, as for Plotinus, God is nothing but the
making of all things, so that the possibility of not making does not arise....
As in Plotinus, to produce all things is not a ""choice"" on God's part... That
God cannot not create is a consequence, not a limitation, of his absolute
transcendence, his unrelatedness to that which proceeds from him."" Pg. 52  
  
I mean this is the absolute best I can do to make sense of Hart's position -
interpret it through the Dionysian idea of diffusive goodness and love. And
Hart's supporters frequently point out that he's operating within this
'Neoplatonic and Dionysian tradition,' so my move appears to be justified.  
  
But, an appeal to Denys or the Neoplatonic tradition isn't any argument or
textual exegesis, and it seems to me that Dionysius is still subject to the
same criticisms raised in Ed's post. Of course, one could deny Perl's reading
of the Dionysian metaphysics...  ",1851

"But whether or not Hart thinks pantheism can be reconciled with orthodoxy, his

orthodoxy of his necessitarianism via lines of argument that seem to imply
pantheism, since this will simply beg the question against his critics, who
don’t accept pantheism any more than they accept necessitarianism.",366
"Quoting Hart:  
 _For God, deliberative liberty – any “could have been otherwise,” any
arbitrary decision among opposed possibilities – would be an impossible defect
of his freedom._  
And:  
 _A God who merely chooses to create – as one equally possible exercise of
deliberative will among others – is either actualizing a potential beyond his
nature... or he is actualizing some otherwise unrealized potential within
himself...._  
  
I notice that Hart is essentially stating the Modal Collapse objection in
these passages, which purports to find a dilemma according to which either
creation must be as actual as God Himself, or His act of creation must be
utterly arbitrary, random, and unintended on His part.  
  
Rather than rejecting this dilemma as classical theists do, or taking it as an
argument against the Unmoved Mover as atheistic proponents of the argument do,
Hart affirms the first leg of the dilemma, collapsing creation into necessity
and thus crossing into pantheism. He wants to arbitrarily take this only
halfway, though, rather than following that line of logic to its full
implication that change and multiplicity are illusions, and only Being Itself
exists, a la Parmenides.  
  
As Ed points out, to assume that creation must be as necessary as God in order
to be caused by God ignores the distinction between active potency and passive
potency. And that distinction isn't some special pleading, but rather a direct
implication of the Unmoved Mover argument.  
  
I would argue that the idea that creation must be either necessary or random
also evinces a tendency especially common among moderns to try to collapse
free will (the choices of rational agents with will and intellect) into either
blind law-like automation or random chance, the two broad categories of
mindless, mechanistic causation allowed by the ""scientific"" reductionist-
mechanistic worldview. _Even though we experience it all the time in our own
choices_ , they simply have a difficult time understanding that a free
rational agent can cause things such that they are not necessitated by the
agent's nature but are still grounded in it and non-random, and that this does
not reduce to something less.",2200

Augustine assures us that God does not in fact cause our choices, God merely
knows them. Which is obviously wrong if God creates eveything as it is. Which
he also asserts. Creation is eternally happening. Caused by God. See
Augustine's ""Confessions - Book XI"". Augustine never took all of this to its
logical ends.. He never realized his claim that God did not cause our actions
good or bad was logically and rationally wrong.  
  
Augustine had some large conceptual blind spots. Which is theology's basic
problem. Of course any theologian who realized this sort of problem confirmed
classical theology was nonsense dared not admit it in writing publically. Not
unless he find himself pronounced anathema, excommunicated, stripped of any
offices he held, and losing any rights to teach in any University if he held a
license to teach.  
  
You see the problem here.  
I naturally wonder how many theologians came to realize this sort of
theological nonsense was nonsense and simply avoided trouble by not hinting at
any of his realizations theology was bunk. Jean Messlier was an example of a
well respected priest who scorching opinions were only known posthumously.  
  
Did Augustine abandon free will? Yes. Read the Council of Orange. Which
followed Augustine until that turned out to be problematic.  
  
Later, insisting free will was impossible as Augustine suggested became
heresy. A monk, Gottshalk of Orbis, who insisted on Augustine's abandoment of
free will was censuted and spent 20 years in prison, refusing to abandon that
opinion. The Synod of Paris in the tenth century, pronounced that opinion
heresy, utterly abandoning the Council Of Orange. Manuscripts about the
Gottshalk affair only recently have been gathered and translated. I do not
know if these have yet been published.  
  
You might want to read the Council of Orange.  
  
We have very little about the discussions of theologians of the time who
realized Augustine's theology made God author and creator of all horrendous
evil and suffering forcing abandment of that theology, but that in fact
happen, and the Council of Orange, the end product of Augustian theology was
quietly but thoroughly abandoned starting in the sixth century. Some of the
theolgians who were involved in this abandonment of strict Augustinian
theology are known, but the few writings they left are very hard to find. Some
seem to have not been translated from Latin.  
My effots to trace all of this theological puzzles is still ongoing, and there
are huge gaps in all of this, but it is obvious Augustine's theology was seen
as problematic and was abandoned for what we now call semi-Pelgianism.

Regarding St. Augustine's argument, it addresses the point that God would know
the state of the world at creation. After all God knows the state of the world
past, present, and future, so despite your inept assertions otherwise, this
point has not eluded theologians preceding nominalism or Luther or certainly
not you. So why don't you stop pretending? It isn't fooling anyone.  
  
The suggestion that St. Augustine abandoned his account of free will later in
his career is a sad trope in older reformed Protestant theology. Your
repetition of this sad trope shows that you are most certainly not familiar
with the secondary literature on these issues. The account of the will found
in his early Cassiacum Dialogues (On the Freedom of the Will) is maintained in
his anti-Pelagian writings (e.g. On Grace and Free Will). It is also
maintained in his City of God. Han Luen Kantzer Komline has traced St.
Augustine on the will in Augustine on the Will: A Theological Account. This
work makes clear that St. Augustine did not abandon and account on the Freedom
of the Will. It really only takes a cursory reading of a few of St.
Augustine's early and late works to realize this. In light of this, it is
clear that you are familiar with neither St. Augustine nor the secondary
literature on St. Augustine. So, again, who do you think you are fooling? Why
keep pretending?  
  
I would continue to expose the nonsense in your post, but I am left to wonder
whether it would do any good in encouraging you to stop being a shameless
pretender. Perhaps as a sign of goodwill, you might recognize that you have no
clue what you are talking about with respect to St. Augustine. Then we can
move on to other things that you have no clue about. Recognizing your

that creates this Universe as it is actualized. So where does this ternal

events without determinism. While it is convenient to pretend like there are
not answers given in the Christian Tradition by not mentioning them, there is
a certain intellectual dishonesty to this if you are aware of these answers.
If you are not aware of them, well now you are aware of one such answer. You
might ask yourself: am I really willing to consider such answers or am I hell
bent on avoiding serious consideration of such resolutions. If the latter, I
might ask: why are you so determined to get this wrong? Ah, because of
determinism. I see your quandry.",1267

"To be sure, there is _one_ clear sense in which Hart thinks that God does not
create of necessity, insofar as he holds that God is free of “necessitation
under _extrinsic_ coercion,” of “a necessity _beyond_ himself.” Like Fr.
Rooney, me, and the Christian tradition in general, Hart agrees that nothing
_outside_ of God in any way compels him to create. For that matter, there is
also a sense in which Fr. Rooney, I, and the Christian tradition in general
agree with Hart that God acts of necessity in _some_ respects. In particular,
there is no disagreement with Hart when he writes: “Can God lie? Can God will
evil? No and no, manifestly, because he is the infinite unhindered Good.”",686

power and necessity. -Bill Solomon",346

"The problem with this is that it contradicts the reader’s first statement, to
the effect that creation adds nothing to God. For if God cannot be boundless
in love without creating the world, then creation _does_ add something to God
– it _completes_ or _perfects_ his love. This entails that God _needs
creation_ in order to be complete, perfect, unlimited, unbounded. And this is
no less heretical than is the claim that God creates of necessity. Thus does
the First Vatican Council [teach
that](https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/first-vatican-council-1505)
“there is one true and living God, creator and lord of heaven and earth,
almighty, eternal, immeasurable, incomprehensible, **_infinite in_** will,
understanding and **_every perfection_** ” (emphasis added).  Of course, Hart
would not be moved by the pronouncements of a Catholic council, but the
doctrine is grounded in scripture and tradition.  For example, Matthew 5:48
says: “You, therefore, must be perfect, _as your heavenly Father is perfect_.”
It is also a consequence of God’s pure actuality, for only what has some
unactualized potential could fail to be perfect.",1140

What follows the comma here does not follow in any way from what precedes the

sound and valid arguments. You should focus particularly on defining terms.
For you to make a demonstrative argument, you need to be able to define the
terms and reach agreement on the terms with those you are making the argument
with. Then you can move forward together in a demonstration. This is, again,

Clearly, God does have at least one reason not to create, namely the
possibility of sin and suffering. In answer to your question, then, I grant
that God had at least one reason not to create. But that is beside the issue.  
  
The issue is the following: Given God’s reasons for and against creating, was
it inevitable that God would choose to create? In other words, was God’s
choice to create (a) wholly determined by reason or (b) at least partially
arbitrary or random?  
  
I argue that (b) is incompatible with classical theism, and I think everyone
involved agrees. Thus, we must assert (a) in the alternative.  
  
But (a) means that creation is inevitable. If the reasons in favor of creation
outweigh the reasons against it—as we know they do simply based on our own

need to be addressed for a few reasons.  
  
First, like all of us, he is not beyond the hope of repentance.  
  
Second, his claims will not likely fool anyone, but they need a response so
that everyone continues to recognize that what he is saying is sheer non-
sense. This is important so that other people are not confused by his own
confusion or malice. They will see it for what it is, just as you and I do.  
  
The third reason that his posts need to be addressed is because they include
blasphemy. He is denying Divine Goodness and making other heretical and

A few words about Molinism. Luis De Molina proposed middle knowledge. That in
any possible world, God would know what a sentient agent would do. Many
critics have rightfully written this idea is incoherent and unlikely.  
  
For example, consider an agent, John, in possible worlds. A world with Nazis,
Stalin's gulags and great evils and suffering. Or a world without suffering
caused by Nazis and Stalin. God would know what John would do in all details
in any actualized possible world.  
  
Since to create a world, God must choose an initial starting state of creation
God's omniscient foreknowledge would allow God to know the future, no sentient
being in that Universe has free will. Any such Universe is necessarily hard
determinate.  
  
And God would know that. God does not have to know all possible world's, just
the fact that any Universe necessarily has an initial state of creation that
determines all events in that actualized world.  
  
Of course if fate, not God is responsible for this actualized Universe and
even God gets no choice, Molinism is necessarily impossible.

"All told, then, it is clear that Hart does not deny, or at least cannot

"I always think it is helpful to point out that God, of absolute necessity, has
some will regarding the finite order. That is, He necessarily knows all of the
ways that He can be imitated and He necessarily wills at least one of those
options (although not any particular one). Among these are no creation, the
current creation, and some other creation. That distinction helps bridge the
gap between the absolutely necessary (God having some opinion about the
created order) and the necessary by supposition (God willing this particular
created order).

cannot not create is a consequence, not a limitation, of his absolute
transcendence, his unrelatedness to that which proceeds from him.""_  
  
One would hope that Dionysius (or Perl) are a little more sensible than that:
if God ""is nothing but"" the making of all things, then he cannot be
""unrelated"" to all things and transcendent above them. Not, at least, using
those terms in any ordinary sense. Maybe using them by infra-contradiction, in
which the word instead means its opposite.",719

Have you noticed that no one hear takes your assertions parading as arguments
seriously? And have you considered that maybe, just maybe, everyone else is
not the problem? There's some food for thought.  
  
Yet another person above noted that you are presupposing determinism and then
also pretending like it is the conclusion of an argument. Everyone here sees
this clearly and you wish for us to believe that you are the only person, not
just here, but in all of theological history with 20/20 vision on this
question? That suggestion authentically moves beyond laughable to worthy of
pity.  
  
The reason you are parading your initial premise as the conclusion to an
argument is because you are not competent in either theology or the rudiments
of logic. To help with the latter point you might read Kreeft's Socratic Logic
or Logic as a Liberal Art by Houser.  
  
And it is not an ad hominem attack to point out how and why your are wrong
about Augustine abandoning his position on the freedom of the will. You made a
baseless assertion, it was shown to be false and you ignored this just like
you ignored it when I called you out in another post about not having the
slightest understanding of the tools involved in biblical exegesis. So
pointing out that you don't know what you are talking about is quite relevant
to our discussion. And pointing out that you ignore this and pretend like it
did not happen is also relevant. It shows a lack of good will.  
  
And, again, I responded to your puerile attempt to make argument about the
initial state of the world above. You ignored this and I have seen you do this
on multiple occasions. If you don't like it, you ignore it. Ignoring such
responses of course results in ignorance.

few theologians and no one here is fooled. Have you managed to fool any
publishers into believing in your singular brilliance? We are all on the edge
of our seats waiting for that book to come out from a major publisher.

it likely that the cult of 1 called ""WCB"" is going to multiply with these

"5\. Finally, Hart makes a point in defense of the orthodoxy of his position,
claiming:",86
"Second, the claim that “‘necessity’ is not a meaningful concept in relation to
God” is simply not true in the classical theist tradition within which Hart,
Rooney, and I are all operating. That tradition holds, for example, that God
_exists_ of necessity insofar as he is subsistent being itself, pure
actuality, and so on. Hart might respond that he is not denying that there is
necessity in God in _that_ sense. But then, it will not do to dismiss Fr.
Rooney’s criticisms on the basis of the completely general assertion that
“‘necessity’ is not a meaningful concept in relation to God.”",589
"In [a recent article](http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2022/10/divine-freedom-
and-heresy.html), I commented on Fr. James Dominic Rooney’s
[critique](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/the-incoherencies-of-
hard-universalism/) of David Bentley Hart. My focus was, specifically, on Fr.
Rooney’s objections to Hart’s view that God’s creation of the world follows
inevitably from his nature. That position, as Rooney points out, is heretical.
In the comments section [at Fr. Aidan Kimel’s
blog](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/10/18/fr-rooney-takes-on-dbh-and-
universalism/), Hart defends himself, objecting both to Rooney’s
characterization of his position and to the claim that it is heretical. Let’s
take a look.",722
"Regarding the council of Orange and semi-pelagianism: Here again, this
assertion reflects a high level of confidence and a high level of ignorance
mixed in a toxic cocktail. Pelagianism is a heresy. And Church councils
condemn heresy, rather than upholding a moderated version of heresy (i.e.
semi-heresy).Semi-pelagianism, which is imprecise and often undefined, denies
the role of God's grace in the initial movement of the will toward God. This
is denied by both the Council of Orange and St. Augustine. In fact it is
condemned by the Council of Orange as heresy. So, the council of Orange
*nowhere* condemned St. Augustine. It did however condemn a version of the
very same heresy that St. Augustine fought so tirelessly against.  
  
Now, the key here for anyone who cares about orthodoxy is that heresy and
orthodoxy are not defined by the self-appointed pope WCB. It is defined by the
Church that the Scripture's refer to as ""the pillar and foundation of truth""
and which Christ said ""the gates of hell will not prevail against it"". Satan
is the father of lies and where lies prevail (e.g. in the thought of WCB),
there Satan prevails. This has not and cannot happen in Christ's Church which
is the pillar and foundation of truth. So, as I mentioned below, WCB, no one
here is interested in joining the cult of WCB. Your judgements are pervasively
erroneous and you should consider tempering that unflinching confidence in
your own wisdom. Trusting that rickety old bridge is going to lead you to fall
into a pit.  
  
As a final note to the interested reader, it is not enough to read Scripture
and quote it. We have to interpret it correctly and there is such a thing as a
heretical interpretation (for examples of this, review the writings of WCB).
Pelagius was, after all, not reading the funny papers when he arrived at his
position that ""there was when the word was not"". He was reading the book of
Proverbs and offering a heretical interpretation of this book (He also wrote a
commentary on Romans.). So, it is not enough to quote Scripture. Satan quoted
Scripture. You have to interpret it truly with the pillar and foundation of
truth and this involves submitting to the judgements of Church councils which
are under the guidance of the Holy Spirit as we see in Acts 15 from St. James'
words (""it seemed good to us and to the Holy Spirit"") as the council sent out
letters to the Churches notifying all Christians of the decision of the
council. They did not say, ""well take a bible--if your literate--and decide
what you think on this issue and, if you are not literate, just follow whoever
is most able to convince you with ""smooth and flattering words that will
""tickle your ears"" (two quotes from Scripture, I will leave to the reader to
look them up). Instead, everyone knew that they must obey the judgement of the
leaders of the Church at the Jerusalem council. After all, Hebrews teaches,
""Obey your leaders"". It is for this reason that they did not say, ""Let me see
what you think about that and then I will decide whether or not you got it
right."" That would be the arrogant and foolish approach of WCB. Instead, they
received the letter with joy and docility because they understood the teaching
of Scripture: ""Obey your leaders.""",3256
"""For God, there is no real past, present, or future, to God all is Now. God
can directly experience every part of that Big Now. Difficuly one is if there
is no real past, there can be no before, now, afterwards.""  
  
The first sentence is not how a classical Theist would make the sort of
assertion you are trying to make. If you are going to engage in dialogue where
anyone at all takes you seriously, you are going to have to make more effort
understanding the positions you appear hell bent on rejecting. Perhaps if you
at least understand them correctly, that spark within you that cares about
understanding rather than pretending might be fanned into a flame.  
  
To say is correctly, you would say that God is not bound by time. That is a
correct way to state the initial premise in an argument that you are set on
criticizing. Now this requires an understanding of time and time's relation to
matter, if you are going to actually understand a classical theist on this
point.  
  
In your third sentence quoted above you move from talking about God being
outside time to simply making the assertion that this entails that there is
not past, present, or future. Here you move from the assertion that since God
is outside time, everyone and everything must be outside time. Well once it is
framed that way (and this is an accurate way to frame the issue based on St.
Augustine and St. Thomas' understanding of the relationship between time and
matter--again more below--and God's relationship to time and matter), it
becomes clear that what you are saying is sheer nonsense. So if you are going
to frame a critique of classical theism, you are going to have to offer
something beyond a sophmoric and blundering misinterpretation and
misrepresentation of the premises of the classical theists argument.  
  
Regarding the relationship between time and matter, Philo and St. Augustine
held that these are interdependent and this is confirmed by modern physics
(See Barr's Modern Physics and Ancient Faith). We are subject to the limits
associated with time because we are corporeal beings and there is
interrelationship between time and matter. After all, we measure time with
respect to the movement of matter (e.g. the rotation of the earth around the
sun). So the argument requires a deeper understanding and exposition of their
understanding of time in order to get their argument right in the first place.  
  
You have not taken the time to understand all of this which is why there is no
one here that is impressed with what you have to say on this matter. If you
wish to have your arguments taken seriously, why don't you first make a
serious effort to consider the arguments of figures like St. Augustine and St.
Thomas? This of course requires that you actually make a good faith effort to
understand them on their terms. Now this would also require a smidge of
humility in recognizing that they have something to teach you and that it is,
to put it gently, relatively unlikely that you have created a fool proof
argument against God's existence that no one else has ever considered.
Humility and a firm grasp on reality always walk together hand in hand.",3169
"First, the argument seems to boil down to mere semantic sleight of hand.
Again, Hart holds that “creation _inevitably follows_ from who [God] is,”
denies that there is “ _any_ ‘could have been otherwise’” where creation is
concerned, and so forth. This counts as holding that God creates of necessity
_given the standard philosophical and theological use of “necessity.”_ Hence,
if Hart really is denying that he takes God to create of necessity, the denial
rings true only if he is using the word in some idiosyncratic way.",524

"WCB,  
  
I have already noted Komline's Augustine on the Will in the Oxford Historical
Theology series published in 2019. I have also noted some of the relevant
works of St. Augustine that you are not familiar with that show that he did
not change his position. The work that shows this most clearly is a work
written by St. Augustine at the end of his life called: The Retractions. St.
Augustine knew that his writings would be maintained and widely read after his
death because his fame was already so widespread during his life. He was also,
like any faithful Catholic, concerned about orthodoxy and that he did not lead
others into error in any way. This reflects his charity, which is why he was a
saint.  
  
In order to ensure that any mistakes in his writings did not lead others
astray, he read through them at the end of his life carefully and retracted
any statements that were erroneous. Such retractions are found in his work:
The Retractions. This is relevant for our discussion because he revisited his
early Cassiacum dialogues, including On the Freedom of the Will. And did he
make the sweeping assertion that he completely rejected his early account of
the will in this work? Nope. He made small and precise corrections to his
cassiacum dialogues while continuing to hold to his main lines of argument
within them.  
  
St. Augustine was a clear, compelling, cogent, and precise thinker. That
precision entailed that he avoided gross and unsupported generalizations of
the sort that fly off your keyboard, WCB. So, no he didn't ""reject his account
of the will"". That sweeping generalization has as much support as your other
sweeping generalizations. That is, it has no support.  
  
It is a bad habit to make such unsupported generalizations and to do so with
such a high level of confidence. After all, a high level of confidence with a
high level of ignorance is a fairly toxic combination.",1912
"Third, Hart is in any case not himself consistent on this point. For in his
comments at Fr. Kimel’s blog, he asserts that “creation follows _necessarily_
from who God freely is,” and he compares God’s creation of the world to “a
mother’s love for her child… [which] flows _necessarily_ from her nature,
unimpeded by exterior conditions.” Even Hart, then, allows that there is a
sense in which he is committed to the claim that God creates of necessity.",452
"Your criticism may well be unworthy of his attention. He is no doubt a very
man, and you may well be a crank. Who knows what endless reams of imbacilic
junk you plied him with.",176
"In [my review](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2022/03/80430/) of Hart’s
_You Are Gods_ , commenting on Hart’s view that creation follows inevitably
from God’s nature, I noted that “it is hard to see how this is different from
the Trinitarian claim that the Son is of necessity begotten by the Father; and
if it isn’t different, then creation is no less divine than the Son is.”
Hart’s necessitarian view of creation is thus one of several respects in
which, as I noted in the review, his position collapses into a kind of
pantheism. And as Pohle and Preuss note in their manual _God: His Knowability,
Essence, and Attributes_ , against the traditional doctrine of divine
perfection, it is precisely “Pantheists [who] object that ‘God plus the
universe’ must obviously be more perfect than ‘God minus the universe’” (p.
188).",828
"Well, in the case of the human mother, she could have decided not to have a
child at all. True, given that she does have the child, her nature, if
unimpeded (by sin or by mental illness, say), will lead her inevitably to love
the child. But that’s a conditional necessity, and the antecedent could have
failed to be true. Unlike the dog (which has no choice in the matter) a human
being can freely decide not to have children. But analogously, even if God
cannot fail to love the world _if_ he creates it, his freedom is still
manifest in the fact that he nevertheless could have refrained from creating
it in the first place.",626
"_Not that I give a toss about Roman dogma, but the fact remains that there is
no doctrinal rule regarding the metaphysical content of the claim that God
creates freely… [W]hat I have written on the matter is one very venerable way
of affirming divine freedom in creation._",272
"Had God a compelling reason not to create, we would not be having this
discussion.",82
"Now, given standard philosophical and theological usage of “necessary” and
cognate terms, it is clear that Hart is asserting that God creates the world
_of necessity_. For example, in _The Encyclopedia of Philosophy_ ’s article on
“Contingent and Necessary Statements,” necessity is characterized as “what
must occur,” whereas contingency involves “what may or may not occur.” _The
Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy_ defines “necessity” as “a modal property
attributable to a whole proposition… just when it is not possible that the
proposition be false.” Wuellner’s _Dictionary of Scholastic Philosophy_
defines “necessary” as “that which cannot not-be,” “that which must be and be
as it is,” and “that which must act as it does and which cannot act
otherwise.” Obviously, Hart thinks God’s creation of the world _must_ occur,
given his nature. He thinks that it is _not possible_ that the proposition
that _God creates the world_ be false. He thinks that God _must_ act to create
the world, that his act of creation _cannot not-be_. Hence, again, given
standard usage, Hart clearly thinks that God creates the world _of necessity_.",1134

"part 2  
As far as I’m concerned, this is all mystical, pseudo-philosophical gibberish.
None of these ‘explanations’ mean anything. What is an “eternal act,” or
knowledge that doesn’t produce a “metaphysical change” in the knower, or
something willed “from everlasting”? Yes, your idea of God is immune to most
atheistic attacks, but in securing this victory, you basically hollow out the
definition so much that not only is there no trace left of a loving Father we
can have a personal relationship with (not such a serious problem for
religions like Buddhism, but a massive blow for traditional Christianity), but
‘God,’ identified as nothing more than a string of abstract concepts, is (like
all abstractions) absolutely bereft of any concrete reality independent of a
thinking subject.  
Third leading from my second issue is are you a Pantheist David? I have read
both yours and Ed Fesers blog sites and I recall you saying “The accusation of
pantheism troubles me not in the least… There are many ways in which I would
proudly wear the title… I am quite happy to be accused of pantheism.”  
So, unless you were being facetious, I don't see how that doesn't confirm his
and his followers' beliefs about you. You've also said that ""Pantheism is a
vague term."" Well, the simplest definition is God=World that's it, he is
immutable, indifferent, formless and eternal. However, is it possible that the
accusations of pantheism are actually misunderstood as Panentheism?  
Put simply, a Panentheist (also known as also known as Monistic Monotheism),
is the belief, similar to Pantheism, that the physical universe is joined to
God, but stressing that God is greater than (rather than equivalent to) the
universe. Thus, the one God is synonymous with the material universe and
interpenetrates every part of nature (as in Pantheism), but timelessly extends
beyond as well. This conception of God influenced New England
Transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, and was popularized by Charles
Hartshorne (1897 – 2000) in his development of process theology in the 20th
Century. The Neoplatonism (which you declare yourself a follower of) of
Plotinus (in which the world itself is a God) is to some extent panentheistic
with polytheistic tendencies, and philosophical treatises have been written on
it in the context of Hinduism for millennia (notably in the “Bhagavad Gita”
and the “Shri Rudram”). For more details on Panentheism I have provided a
video link below, feel free to watch it.  
Despite all of what I have said David I still hold you in high regard, you're
intelligent, witty and can keep your biases in check. (Something I feel is
becoming rarer by the day)

"I don't think people most people actually understand the accusation if
pantheism they're making. An identification of God with Existence or, to use
more platonic language, The One (The Good), cannot in principle be a
pantheistic conception, since the world is obviously a complex and changing
object. Panentheism may fit better, but even here outside of emanating from a
singular object, due to the absolute simplicity of the absolute, it's
impossible for the world to be a part of it, it lacks the parts with which
anything outside of it could ever truly be related to it. Arguably, the
platonist conception of the absolute is even simpler than Aristotle's unmoved
mover, for the reason that Plotinus argues against Aristotle's idea of it
being Thinking thinking about thoughts. Whether it's correct or not, Plotinus
argues that every kind of knowledge involves minimal composition. In that
sense, the One cannot be an intellect, which doesn't mean though that it's
wholly unmental.  
  
It may be easier for me than for others here since, even though I'd call
myself Christian, I have zero emotional investment in the religion and would
be indifferent to dropping it, but the accusation that a lofty conception of
God removes any kind of personal relation, for me, just shows that we too
heavily rely on a, frankly, infantile conception of the supreme being, instead
of following the intellectual route of letting ourselves be led into complete
apophaticism, in the footsteps of Plotinus and Pseudo-Dionysius. What would
knowledge be if it doesn't change? Well, not the knowledge of truths we know
it, but acts that *produce* these truths. The convergence with existence and
the ultimate dependency of everything on it entails that at the grass roots of
knowledge, power or morality, these concepts are entailed by
existence/goodness. This is just the logical consequence, something O'Conner
hinted at in his book on the contingency argument. Furthermore in regards to
knowledge I'd once again reference Barry Miller who quotes Patrick Grim, the
idea of omniscience as propositional knowledge (P is true, God knows that P),
is not a conception that can be applied to God, this just leads to
contradictions. But it also means that his mode of knowledge would be as much
comparable to ours as Aquinas' pure esse would be to Frege's existential
quantifier",2354

"This is a new idea that I had not heard of. And I admit that there's room for
more understanding, but I would hazard this:  
  
By ""living uterus donation"" do you mean Jane, who is healthy, giving over her
uterus to Sally, whose uterus is damaged and cannot be healed, so that Sally
can conceive a and bear a child?  
  
If we assume that Jane is not offering her uterus _in order to avoid
conceiving_ , the contraceptive aspect of the perverted faculty argument is
not applicable. If, for example, Jane is single and expects to stay that way,
and stably has not been engaging in sexual relations, she can be presumed not
to enter into this for contraceptive reasons. She is not perverting her
faculty of reproduction.  
  
Nor is Sally perverting her faculty of reproduction: her faculty is being
impeded by a damaged organ, which (apparently) can be worked around by medical
means. So far as ""faculty"" arguments go, this is morally licit.  
  
The real weight of the moral difficulty is in Jane effectively maiming
herself: it is not _generally_ reasonable to take away a functioning major
body part. However, the ""generally"" I added there does imply reservations on
how far that applies: it is (by most ethicists) considered moral for a person
to donate one of his 2 kidneys to another whose kidneys have failed. This is
even laudable: the donor can (for the most part) ""get by"" on one kidney -
though they will live a life of increased risk, because they no longer have a
""back-up"" kidney to take over if one is not functioning.  
  
Arguably, Jane can use the same approach to justify donating her uterus to a
woman whose own uterus is damaged: if Jane isn't going to ""use it"", she can
offer its use to another. However, I see potential quagmires here, and I don't
think it's that simple. On the one hand, if Jane is single, on what basis is
she _certain_ she will not marry? If she is married, on what basis is she able
to definitively decide she won't be ""needing"" that uterus any more? (On the
other hand, what if Jane has taken permanent vows of celibacy in a monastic
order, and knows she will not be using her reproductive faculties for
reproduction?)  
  
Secondly, the reproductive organs are highly inter-related, and it is
absolutely _not_ a given that ""because Jane won't be using the organs for
reproduction"" doesn't altogether imply the organs have no health function in
the body. This is manifestly true of the ovaries, and hormonal activity that
regulates tons of other body functions than JUST reproduction. I don't have
any knowledge of whether the uterus, like the ovaries, is involved in other
activities for health. I suspect that (a) the medical system claims those
health risks are minimal, and (b) that they _may_ be oversimplifying the case
in saying so, but I don't actually know.  
  
As to being involved in ""the system"": since there seems (to me, indicated
above) that there is a plausible argument that the underlying donative action
is morally licit _in some cases_ , it comes down to a prudential judgment
whether the overall activity is _nearly always_ a donation precisely because
Jane wants to avoid the possibility of pregnancy, i.e. whether working for it
is supporting something that almost always is being done immorally, or not. If
it is nearly always being done immorally with a contraceptive intent, it might
be imprudent to _support_ the medical practice by aiding the research. If
_not_ , i.e. if there seem to be plenty of cases (even if still in the
minority) that are not donations for contraceptive intentions, then I think
you can use a _general presumption_ of moral licitness of the individual
cases, and this would seem to permit being involved in ""the system"" of medical
support / research in the activity. But that's just my opinion.",3791

Okay, Walter, now that we have established that the emperor is walking around

You wrote:  
  
""theism cannot explain the rules of logic either and cannot take them as
seperate entities because there are no entities that are truly seperate from
God.""  
  
As I pointed out above, theism is not pantheism, so you need to work on that
distinction between credible, reliable witnesses and non-credible witnesses in
order to have better discernment about who to listen to about what is or is
not ""Theism"". Now that we have cleared this up, we can address the final false
statement in your response (You squeezed in quite a few in that little post).  
  
You claimed that theism has no means of accounting for the rules of logic.
Well, you got that one wrong as well. Theism is the *only* means of accounting
for the rules of logic. Let's recap on where we have gotten so far. It is
clear, for reasons noted above, that the laws of logic exist. Anyone making an
argument presupposes this. It is also clear, for reasons noted above, that the
laws of logic are not material. Walter does not have them buried in his
basement (In fact if they were anywhere, it is clear from the foregoing that
they are not at Walter's house).  
  
So, we have laws that exist and are immaterial. Along with this, these laws do
not change from place to place or over time. They are eternal. They are not
contingent on change in the material world. Yet these laws, just like numbers,
have real implications in the material world.  
  
The principle of non-contradiction is not *merely* a principle of thought. It
also permeates material being. It is for this reason that no one has ever seen
a non-chair-chair or a square circle or a married bachelor. They are
impossible to conceptualize and they are impossible to be (or exist).  
  
So, if these principles effect being and yet seem also to be mind dependent,
how else do we account for them except by an eternal mind? Now Mr. Walter, if
you have read your Edward Feser, you should be having flashbacks at this point
because Dr. Feser makes precisely this argument with regard to numbers and
other abstract objects in Five Proofs. He aptly refers to it as the
Augustinian argument. Now we have cleared up the last of your string of
misunderstandings. In the future, perhaps you might pause and reflect on
whether or not it is cogent to try to convince us that your keyboard does not
exist by means of typing on it.  
  
Now, Mr. Don Jindra. I hope to address your proposal sometime soon.

"This begs the question against the paper since the conclusion of the paper's
argument is precisely that thinking cannot even in principle be a material
process, and thus cannot be carried out just by a material thing. There must

to be able to carry out thinking with determinate semantic content.  
The current state of brain science doesn't change that. The argument is for
the in-principle impossibility of reducing thinking to a material process.

It's important to note though that ""Dharmas are just tropes"" and for them ""The
ultimate ontology consists entirely of tropes. But these, together with the
facts about human interests and cognitive limitations, explain the more
familiar world populated by persisting composite substances with their various
properties. Among the substances in this more familiar world are things that
we also call water atoms. But these, it turns out, are a many masquerading as
a one"" (pp. 60). And if it was any doubt left between humean bundle theory and
buddhist position I think this will suffice.  
  
Siderits then brings up this purported answer to the problem of ""smuggling
substance back in"": ""One might wonder whether the Buddhist reductionist is
entitled to bring facts about human persons into their explanation, given that
humans are themselves substances. But these substances are, they will reply,
reducible to systems consisting of bundles of tropes behaving in accordance
with causal laws. Among the behaviors explained by the relevant causal laws
are the use of convenient designators by such systems. So the reductive
explanation of the intuitions behind the posit of substances does not
illegitimately smuggle substances into the explanans.""  
  
And this brings yet another problem with them: the handwaving appeal to
""sciences"". It's not hard to find these guys arguing that there are ""stone-
wise arranged atoms"" or that natural selection somehow vindicates the idea of
impermanence (Garfield appeals a lot more for these kinds of things, that's
why I'm not using his work that much). But that does not seem right, because
that turns your metaphysics hostage to the scientific findings - the same
findings that may overthrow your own view.  
  
But if we come to focus on other points like their appeal to nominalism, they
suffer from the same problems that Ed emphasized in TLS and Scholastics meta.
The points like how they can even communicate with themselves if there are no
universals - or even worse if there are just ""momentary beings"". But I think
that their denial of universals has some relation with their momentariness
thesis. And that's what I can't even understand in the first place. How can
someone think that something analogous to the Heraclitean position is right in
the first place? It's illogical. And someone might even say that, correctly,
that the ""buddhist logic"" is very different from ""Aristotelian logic"". Fair
enough. But that doesn't explain why someone might think that something so
absurd as ""impermanent beings"" (let alone mereological nihilism, nominalism)
is plausible in the first place. To affirm that ""there are no pots that last
longer than a moment"" and that ""there is just a series of ephemeral pots one
after another"" is not to disprove permanence, but to evade the problem
altogether.

"I would add: if one is growing, and the other is not, **that very growth**
should imply you exercise patience and understanding toward the one lagging
behind. If you have been given a gift more than another person, do not cast
off the other as unworthy: it was a GIFT to you, not your own merit that
brought it. Why, therefore, would you despise the person who has not received
the gift, in which state _you would still be if you had not been granted the
gift?_  
  
And further: by patiently asking God that He also shower your spouse with
comparable gifts of growth, mayhap you will merit God granting such growth.
So: your observing a lack in your spouse is _reason to do something to help
your spouse (by prayer and sacrifice),_ not reason to leave.  
  
And further: do not let pride deceive you: if you see that you have grown in
_one_ way (where your spouse has not), never forget that perhaps your spouse
has grown in 3 or 4 ways less visible, where you have not. There are a
thousand different avenues of growth, not one or two. God works at a different
pace in each area, for each person. And not all growth is manifest to either
the person growing or to those around.  
  
Never imagine that ""incompatibility"" due to one person growing and the other
not constitutes a basis for believing the marriage is ""void"". God's will for
marriage is that it persist through life, even in difficult times, even in the
difficulties of difficult personality clashes. Growth, alone, is not
incompatibility, and even if there were some incompatibility - even if (in
spite of charitable efforts) one spouse becomes _impossible_ to live with,
(say, you became a Catholic and your spouse simply could not stand that) and a
legal separation is necessary, that **does not void or break** the marriage,
it merely means that you should live apart from your spouse for some time. He
or she remains your spouse, until death, just a spouse separated from you.

doesn't end the marriage.)",2049

rights generally, or any individual right specifically as we would understand
those rights as listed the US Bill of Rights or our Declaration of

As it happened, I was specifically looking at a point on which Strauss and C S

Also ""traditional values"", a choice which should send Claremonsters into a

"¡¡¡Cavete!!!  
What on earth is going on! Am I the only one to notice this?!  
Under the cover of ""upstanding"" right wing politics, various authors are
promoting occultism, while spouting edifying Christian vocab left right and
centre.  
  
Here's one example. Michael Warren Davis has done the rounds about Catholic
places, having been published quite a bit - in First Things, Crisis Magazine,
the Catholic Herald. He is out and about elsewhere too - in The Imaginative
Conservative, where he declares he can only slightly disagree (on an issue of
art and beauty) with the late Roger Scruton. He recommends Scruton's work ""On
Hunting"" as ""an account of tradition from the living heart of that tradition"".
The living heart of Idealism, more likely! This is the work that defines God
as ""the subjectivity of the world""!  
  
This is not what concerned me the most (I've mentioned it here before, but
almost nobody seemed to think it of much interest - no doubt they were too
busy reading the ST to notice).  
  
Davis has authored a couple of articles at The American Conservative that are
extremely dangerous to politicised Catholic conservatives. One of them ""When
Witchcraft was Right-Wing"", depicts the witch Gerard Gardner and his followers
as typically right wing. Davis doesn't defend devilry, but the article is
bizarrely non-committal on this issue. Davis only gets a little emotional when
pointing out how modern leftist witches are not true successors of Gardner!  
  
His most recent article in TAC (""War Against the Modern World) definitely
joined the dots. It is a shameless defence of ""Traditionalism"", well-known for
occultism and virulent anti-Christianity in all its forms.. The only criticism
he allows is that Evola is not so nice because Mussolini and Dugin like him,
so Evola - bad. But Guenon - good! And looney tunes King Charles loves Guenon,
so he's great too. Steve Bannon is somewhere between Guenon and Evola, so
Davis says he ain't perfect.  
  
These ""Traditionalists"" are now producing such volumes of material that those
with doubts - real Thomists included, must feel it is useless to respond. It
shouldn't be so difficult. After all, the dressing up of esoteric ideas with
religious imagery is not new. Though Jonathan Pageau's defence of the Kabbala,
and the occult, if only as a ""concept"" or aspect of ""Christianity"" was really
going a bit far, even for one of ""them"".  
  
The minds of well-meaning readers, including Catholics, need to be warned
about Davis and authors like him. How can the conservative media remain silent
and obsequious when faced with these characters who are far more dangerous to
the faith of conservative readers than Marxism and CRT, etc., which they are
obviously not interested in?

"I have never heard of any **authoritative** assertion that an abused wife
_should_ stay with the husband, and especially not say it as if it represented
a rule. Adrian Fonseca is just a news & commentary purveyor, has no authority
to hold forth on ""a teaching"". So, absent any new datum, it's ""just some guy
bloviating"". Like me, here.  
  
The Chrisitan doctrine on suffering is multi-layered, and should not be
reduced to a simple sentence. That said, 4 points are at the heart: (1) not
all suffering can be avoided while staying on the right side of the line of
good action. (2) When suffering _can_ be avoided by a morally licit choice, it
is often prudent (i.e. good, right action) to so. (3) In spite of (2), there
are ALSO many situations where some part of suffering can be avoided, but
willingly taking on and accepting the suffering (taking the suffering
yourself, not subjecting another to the suffering) can be spiritually
valuable, and **in general** a good Christian should expect to accept AT LEAST
SOME avoidable suffering along his life. (4) Accepting avoidable suffering is
_never_ done for its own sake, and therefore it can generally be accounted as
being accepted for some other thing, a good that (will) more than offset the
evil suffered. This is not intrinsically different from doing (troublesome)
exercise to make the body (and soul) stronger - and there is little debate
about that kind of ""accepting suffering"".

So to apply: there is no possible one-size-fits-all rule for abused women. For
some few (if the abuse is not severe), maybe they can achieve more good in the

The converse is true with the writings of those who haven't the slightest grip

less sane, this is a good cue that it is neither good nor true. I hope to say

""The error which I am here trying to correct is one of the most sincere and
respectable errors in the world; I have sympathy enough with it to feel

Thing’ does seem to obliterate the immeasurable difference not only between
what He is and what all other things are but between the very mode of His
existence and theirs. I must at once restore the balance by insisting that
derivative things, from atoms to archangels, hardly attain to existence at all
in comparison with their Creator. Their principle of existence is not in
themselves. You can distinguish what they are from the fact that they are. The
definition of them can be understood and a clear idea of them formed without
even knowing whether they are. Existence is an ‘opaque’ addition to the idea
of them. But with God it is not so: if we fully understood what God is we
should see that there is no question whether He is. It would always have been
impossible that He should not exist. He is the opaque centre of all
existences, the thing that simply and entirely is, the fountain of facthood"".

The last quote is from Lewis's commentary on the nature psalms in the O.T.  
All of the Scripture references in the beginning of the quote are from the

(Reflections on the Psalms, Chapter 8 ""Nature"")  
(Quote)  
""But of course the (Jewish) doctrine of Creation leaves Nature full of
manifestations which show the presence of God, and created energies which
serve Him. The light is His garment, the thing we partially see Him through
(104:2), the thunder can be His voice (29:3–5). He dwells in the dark
thundercloud (18:11), the eruption of a volcano comes in answer to His touch
(104:32). The world is full of his emissaries and executors. He makes winds
His messengers and flames His servants (104:4), rides upon cherubim (18:10),
commands the army of angels.  
All this is of course in one way very close to Paganism. Thor and Zeus also
spoke in the thunder; Hermes or Iris was the messenger of the gods. But the
difference, though subtle, is momentous, between hearing in the thunder the
voice of God or the voice of a god. As we have seen, even in the creation-
myths, gods have beginnings. Most of them have fathers and mothers; often we
know their birthplaces. There is no question of self-existence or the
timeless. Being is imposed upon them, as upon us, by preceding causes. They
are, like us, creatures or products; though they are luckier than we in being
stronger, more beautiful, and exempt from death. They are, like us, actors in
the cosmic drama, not its authors. Plato fully understood this. His God
creates the gods and preserves them from death by His own power; they have no
inherent immortality. In other words, the difference between believing in God
and in many gods is not one of arithmetic. As someone has said ‘gods’ is not
really the plural of God; God has no plural. Thus, when you hear in the
thunder the voice of a god, you are stopping short, for the voice of a god is
not really a voice from beyond the world, from the uncreated. By taking the
god’s voice away—or envisaging the god as an angel, a servant of that
Other—you go further. The thunder becomes not less divine but more. By
emptying Nature of divinity—or, let us say, of divinities—you may fill her
with Deity, for she is now the bearer of messages.""

Catholics submit themselves to voluntarily, involving fasts and all other

What we have here are not examples of a suffering that one accepts and endures

"Right: it is Good's delight to spread good, not solely when and because it is
""owed"", but even where good is not owed. Thus, God's act of creation is
spreading good where no good is owed - no thing _deserves_ to be granted
existence, so for every thing, its existence is a gift to it.  
  
And just as a good person can give goods to others where they are not owed,
out of kindness, generosity, or mercy: so also a person can _relieve debt_ as
a kind of gift to the person who owes. To show this more easily: if John owes
me $100, and Bill kindly pays John's debt to me, I am paid off, and John no
longer owes me. If Bill does this as a gift, nobody is HURT and my debt is
satisfied.  
  
Similarly, if I decide to ""pay off"" John's debt to me by considering it paid,
I make a gift to John like Bill does above. Gifts are not **contrary** to
justice, they are BESIDE it. It's just that I am both the giver and the one
whose receivable is ""paid off"" by my gift.  
  
For moral wrongs, we cannot forgive the part of the wrong that lies in the
_sin against God_ , because that is a debt owed toward God, not us. But we can
forgive the part that is owed to us.  
  
Broadly speaking, it may be either prudent or imprudent to easily forgive some
debts against us: too easily forgiving money debts could cause some people to
become spendthrifts and wastrels. Similarly, too readily forgiving _offenses_
against us might have a similar result. But aside from that measure of
prudence, Christ tells us to be willing to forgive any and all offenses
against ourselves, and indeed the examples of both Christ and the saints shows
them forgiving persecutors right in the midst of those acts of persecution -
where clearly no remorse exists.  
  
Perhaps someone can clarify distinctions about granting forgiveness of the
_offense_ (qua guilt) while not relieving the debt of some kind of

was. That's why I was very (and still am in some way) very afraid to believe

how it tastes (i.e good or desirable), but because that's the truth. That's
why I (wrongly as I can see now) take the road of ""naturalism"". Not only
because of the overwhelming appeal that has today but because it was ""science""

doctrine of espiritismo with the A-T Meta (and I AM NOT DOING SO). What I am

But at the same time, there is a problem with me I couldn't help but think
that what if I got them all wrong? What if their arguments are plausible at
all? I'm not a philosopher, just a normal guy. And I want to confess
something: even though I do not think that something like that (buddhism) is
plausible at all, I am afraid of the possibility that it could be because I am
ignorant and my OCD does not let me go through this. It was a lot hard to
write all these comments - since I am struggling with myself to even conclude
a thought. There were a lot more - and a lot more detailed criticism - that I
want to write but I simply can't (especially a topic at 4.5 that's the most
important part of all it but I don't have the necessary strength and a point
that I tried to make à-la Aristotelian retortion in the sense that they must
presuppose permanence and can't get rid of it in making their arguments in the
same way that Alex Rosenberg can't get rid of intentionality when trying to
'naturalize intentionality').  
  
And for those of you who think: ""why buddhism bothers you that much?"" The
answer should be self-evident by now (and for reasons that make simple
materialism looks like a weekend at the beach): look at the consequences of
all that. There would be no persons, no things, and in some way just
suffering. Life would be just horrible. There would be illusions all around
us. All persons would be substances per accident - and that's just awful and I
can't believe that there are people who find this idea pleasing. And the other
reason is OCD. Looks like nothing that I could present by myself is ever
sufficient to disprove them. Looks like my arguments are never enough - and
since I'm just illiterate in philosophy there is a wall I could never cross.  
  
Unfortunately, I came across buddhism by chance when I was fixated on the
experiment of Benjamin Libet on free will (at least his sense of ""free will"")
and stumbled across the work of Sam Harris arguing that since there was no
free will there is the illusion of the self. Since I have OCD things don't 'go
out' of my head that easily (like in the case of normal people). Since the
idea per se is insane I tried to understand why people think that it's
plausible in the first place. And by their paradoxical 'reductio' way of
arguing and the abuse of science that they always propose (bearing in mind
that I didn't know that there is such a thing as A-T Meta at the time) that
stuck in my head and only got worse through the years.  
  
So, I appreciate it if someone could help me with it. Even though it's not
apparent, I tried to put a lot of effort into solving it. But I simply can't
take it anymore and just reading something from that topic just brings me a
lot of pain.",2773
"I read that Catholic commentator Adrian Fonseca urged women in abusive
marriages to stay in the marriage, enduring more abuse if it comes, and offer
up the abuse for the salvation of souls, especially for the soul of the
abusive husband.  
  
Can someone specify the degree of magisterial authority that attaches to this
teaching? Obviously, since Catholic spouses can still receive the sacraments
after separation, it is not forbidden to separate from an abusive spouse. But
what is the status as moral teaching of the counsel that the abused spouse
continue to endure abuse for the prospective sake of the abusive spouse's
soul?",630

"'Levels of actuality' just seems to be verbiage for saying 'actualities
potential to actualities'. Potentiality is not some random thing that
Aristotelians posit; it indicates the fact that in change things that stay the
same have to be capable of things that don't stay the same. If you have that,
the capability is what people are calling potentiality, regardless of what
words are used for it.  
  
Thus your real argument just seems to be a rejection of prime matter as being
identified with passive potentiality. Prime matter is a conclusion arising
from two lines of argument, (1) no infinite regress in material causes, and
(2) something must be the subject of change in substantial change. Both of
these arguments still go through on your account: there are first material
causes (your 'ultimate physical forms') which remain the same in substantial
change. You just are arguing that prime matter consists entirely of immaterial
forms (= actualities without material causes) that are eternal and unchanging
(because otherwise they would require a subject of change).",1074

inputs""  
  
No we don't. You're describing something more like neuroscience. Merriam-

inference and demonstration : the science of the formal principles of
reasoning""  
  ",540
"No, as the Catholic Church teaches that a marriage between Christians which
was ever valid at all can only dissolved by death.  
  
The slightly longer answer would say that ""growth"" is the _normal_ course of
spouses in marriage, they grow old together, such that even into old age you
""rejoice with the wife of thy youth"" (Prov 5:18).  
  
There is no guarantee, of course, that growth will be equal and concurrent for
both in all ways at all times, but each still has their part to ""bear with one
another, forgiving one another.""

receive our due from others, we must always do our duty.""",750
"As Kurt suggests: it may indeed be possible to ""read"" Francis's words in a
charitable light in which ""what he meant"" was to castigate the nasty
proselytism that uses bad means (and motives) to push people into the Church,
and not to throw stones at the kinder, gentler persuasion by which we justly
bring others to appreciate the true Church of Christ. But at the same time,
Francis used highly ambiguous phrasings to convey that, and - like he has ever
so many other times - he INTENDS to be ambiguous, that's is precisely his
operating method.  
  
In this case, for example, there is, in addition to the negative-connotation
word ""proselytism"" in the second sentence, the word ""convince"" in the first
sentence. There is no reason, outside of Francis's choice to put them next to
each other, to imagine that ""convincing someone of your faith"" amounts to
""proselytism"". Even if one might have (before this) thought he was
**strictly** avoiding the impermissible ""proselytism"" types of action, and
merely speaking so as to ""convince"" a listener of his faith, now he has to
second-guess whether even that is allowable. And so, Francis chose to cloud up
the matter.  
  
It would be silly to look at all the hundreds (at this point) of occasions in
which he has done this, and somehow imagine that they come out evenly divided
between a traditional and a progressive view of Christianity. They do nothing
of the sort: the confusion and obscurity sown is **very decidedly** in favor
of one angle, and that's the progressive view. He's never accidentally
confusing in a way that promotes traditional, standard Catholicism. So, it's
not accidental at all, it's intentional.  
  
(And by the way, in that video by Mike Lofton is FAR from being wholly
exculpatory: take, for example, this quote from a 2007 doc. by BXVI's curia:  
  
_The term proselytism originated in the context of Judaism, in which the term
proselyte referred to someone who, coming from the gentiles, had passed into
the Chosen People….More recently, however, the term has taken on a negative
connotation, to mean the promotion of a religion by ujsing means, and for
motives, contrary to the spirit of the Gospel that is, which do not safeguard
the freedom and dignity of the person. It is in this sense that the term
proselytism is understood in the context of the ecumenical movement: cf. The
Joint Working Group between the Catholic Church and the World Council of
Churches…”_  
  
Sure, the World Council of Churches take the term ""proselytism"" that way,
**precisely because many of them think evangelization is a sin**. And so the
push on the idea of ""proselytism"" = bad, and try to eliminate the meaning of
the term which was just fine until they came along. Trying to control the
language to win the debate. And shame on the Vatican for accepting their
improper constraint on the term. If you want to shame those who proselytize
wrongly, SAY that ""they proselytize wrongly"". Don't change the language just
because it makes you uncomfortable.)

You agree non-contradiction permeates material being. Material being includes
life and us. Our brains were formed in a material universe out of material
and, from birth, we observe a non-contradictory environment (""no one has ever
seen a non-chair-chair""), so it's hardly a surprise non-contradiction is a
basis of right thinking, or a pillar of logic. There is no need to import an
outside, non-material ""it"" to explain our need for non-contradiction in
thought. You are right, Walter does not have a law of non-contradiction (or
laws of logic) buried in his basement. He doesn't have to dig for it. It's
buried in his very being. Principles do not effect being; being effects
principles. You are confusing cause and effect.  
  
Even if I accepted your argument, it still does not follow that an eternal
mind is the cause. When you make that leap it shows me that logic is a wasted

Hi! You offered a good description of these buddhists and pointed out some
true problems with it. I just would notice that the momentariness thesis is
not necessarily what all buddhists defend, Nagarjuna argued against it. A
argument of his i remember:  
  
if things last for a moment and them are gone would not this triple process of
start existing-acting-ceasing to be generate a infinite regress? The existing
action itself would have a start existing-acting- ceasing to be process and so
its three parts, and the start of this process would have one as well and...
you know that this does not ends, quite a good reading(but only read Nagarjuna
with commentaries!)  
  
Also: if Nagarjuna is my reference again his principal reason for negating
substances existence would be that he conceptualize substance as the indian
Atman: something unchanging, and did not accept that a substance and its
acidents could be diferent while the acidents depended on the substance(for
him, either you do not depend on the other thing at all, like a man and his
girlfriend, or there is just 1 and not 2 things). Aristotle was needed there.  
  
And my principal problem with any buddhist worth the name: how exactly things
change orderly if there is no substance ordering acidents? Why the color
acidents aways generate the visual perception and not a auditory one or pain?
Saying that things act on law-like patterns is just to describe things; there
is no explanation at all.

John Lilburne (c. 1614 – 29 August 1657), also known as Freeborn John, was an
English political Leveller before, during and after the English Civil Wars
1642–1650. He coined the term ""freeborn rights"", defining them as rights with
which every human being is born, as opposed to rights bestowed by government

"Mr. Jindra,  
  
You are spot on that the materialist had not thought through his position, but
you are mistaken in thinking that you have thought through yours. Dr. Yogami
offers you some help above, some of which I am going to reiterate by
explaining the difference between a debate and a lecture.  
  
At a debate you consider whether a particular proposition is true or false. A
debate such as the one noted above would normally be in a form such as:
whether or not materialism is true. That would be the proposition under
consideration and one person would take the affirmative side (i.e. Yes, it is
true) and another would take the negative side (i.e. no it is not true).  
  
In such a debate, it is important that the terms are defined. Otherwise,
equivocation can occur and the debaters will talk past one another. So, it
would be important to clarify that materialism is the assertion that matter is
all that there is. Once that is established and the questions are established,
folks then make arguments for their positions. That is the way a debate works.  
  
Now what you describe is a situation where you refuse to participate in the
debate and stand with your hands crossed. Well, that is not a debate. That is
a lecture wherein, in this instance, you sit and listen to Dr. William Lane
Craig and learn from him. Now that would be very good for you, but the point
is that such a situation is not a debate.  
  
In fact, it would be very awkward for you to stand in front of a crowd with a
podium next to Dr. Craig and just gawk at him. You are going to have to say or
do something. Now if you say something, you are doing to have to either: a.
utter complete non-sense (perhaps you might simply repeat the letter Q over
and over again), or b. make an argument for your case. Either way you end up
looking like bafoon who cannot offer the slightest support for your position
without showing your behind (here you and Walter and Dr. Craig's opponent have
something in common).  
  
Now, there is an alternative. Rather than saying something, you could do
something. For example, you could do interpretive dance while Dr. Craig makes
his arguments. You could do ballet and offer a rendition of the nutcracker. Or
you might simply do the macarena. All viable options.  
  
Or, perhaps, you might sit in the audience and learn from Dr. Craig. This last
option seems to me the wisest alternative. But, then, we would not have a
debate now would we? You would be the wiser and maintain your dignity, but
this would be a lecture from Dr. Craig and not a debate.",2569

With magisterial statements, I realise there is the last resort of withholding
assent from non-infallible teachings, by someone who is sufficiently qualified
and who has sufficient justifiying reasons. But once someone takes that step
in one case, it does seem to easily become a habit, and a bottomless pit of
doubt and dissent.  
  
The typical Catholic trying to be faithful, and trying to learn more about
their faith from Church documents, isn't in a good position to make these
assessments, and they would end up with diminished confidence in a vast range

Your argument (and Feser's) is that the laws of logic (or numbers)

If it is true that the laws of logic are necessary parts of God's mind, then
that means there is a law of logic that says the laws of logic are part of
God's mind, but that particular law of logic that says this, is not part of
God's mind, because God's mind necessarily having those laws depends on the
laws of logic.

it, but the imagination is not a cause of simple truth about reality.  
  
So all so called ""transgender"" people are intellectually confused for varied
and complex reasons. The evil transgender industry relies upon and encourages
this confusion.  
  
A person very close to me had a ""sex change"" operation. I tried to stop him.
Years later, he said that he had made a mistake (this is actually common). He
thanked me for having tried to stop him. Years after that, he killed himself

choice to follow the evil industry's guidance (suicide is also common in so-
called transgenders).

What you conveniently call ""gender confusion"" in animals is certainly not a
phenomenon dependent upon reason and intellectual ideas, because animals do
not have reason or ideas dependent upon reason. They do not think, so their
thinking cannot be confused.  
  
Humans tricked into believing false things are tricked through their
intellects. Human behavior is controlled, one way or another, by what we
arrive at through thinking and what we think can be confused and incorrect,
especially when others are trying to confuse for their own purposes. A person
given a false argument that convinces him that he can drive up a ramp at a
certain speed and leap his car over a big rock might try it and consequently
hurt himself based on the false idea that the argument was correct, and this
would be a mistake or confusion of his intellect, not of his feelings.  
  
Animals kill each other too so I guess that means it is OK to kill another

"I'd like to discuss the Scholastic distinction between potency and act. It is
often alleged that without this distinction, it is impossible to make sense of
change. I'm not so sure about that.  
  
Surely we can account for change simply by positing different levels of
actuality. Thus an actual piece of gold (a substance) may acquire the higher-
level (accidental) actualizations of roundness and flatness, when hammered by
a goldsmith. There's no need for talk of mysterious potencies here - just
different levels of actuality.  
  
Consider also the fact that every potency, whether passive or active, is
grounded in some actuality. A boxer, for instance, has the passive power to be
bruised because his body is actually covered with flesh, and he has the active
power to hit and knock out his opponent because his body actually contains
bone and muscle, enabling him to punch hard.  
  
Readers might ask, ""What's the difference between the account you're proposing
and the Aristotelian account? And couldn't simply we define 'potency' as a
lower level of actuality?"" The practical difference between the two accounts
is that if every potency is grounded in some actuality, then the existence of
prime matter, or pure passive potency, becomes a metaphysical impossibility.
It's actuality all the way down, until we finally get to some ultimate
physical forms (quantum fields, perhaps?) underlying the everyday objects we
see.

try to communicate back, I will not understand as I have not seen your Truman
show. However, since you have seen mine, I know that you will understand the
points I am driving at by my questions. This will give you some food for
thought while you are in your cage.  
  
The first question is: could you tell us what study has identified the three
movements of the intellect (understanding, judgement, syllogism) with
particular elements on the periodic table? And, which elements are associated
with which movement? And if not elements, perhaps compounds? If so, which
compounds are associated with which movements? And is it that the compound has
to be located in the person, or in the brain, or in a particular place in the
brain at a particular time to have a particular thought? And if the compound
present in one person when they think that thought, how do you know that this
compound is *causing* the thought? Or are you identifying it with the thought?
And how do you know it does not merely correspond with the thought rather than
causing it or being identified with it? And if it were causing the thought or
identified with it in *this person* how do you know that the same occurs in
all people? If a certain element, compound, or process is associated with a
thought in person A, how do you know that this occurs in all people in the
world? And if it does not occur with all people in the world, how can you
reduce understanding of some concept or some judgement with a particular
element, compound or process?  
  
These are just a few questions for you to chem on in your cage. Given how
important evidence is to you, I am sure that you have evidential answers to
all of these questions. If not, that would again show you to be a complete
hypocrite and from your posts and our interaction, I know that this cannot be
so....  
  
Or perhaps you would tell us that you know none of the answers to these
questions and that we just need to trust you that you are correct anyways.
Well, given your omniscience about the upbringing of everyone on here that you
interact with, that makes all the sense in the world. Just like you can know
about everyone you interact with and they can't know about you, so you can
require evidence of others but don't have to give it yourself. Well, that's

" _That means that, according to William James, when a transgender girl feels

Good gravy, that's not sound logic at all.  
  
It is admitted by all that SOME feelings of ""being"" this or that gender are
not stable, but are passing. (Various subgroups explicitly trade on the _moral
right_ to change their gender identity as they feel). Therefore, it is a
simple datum that ""when a trans (or any) girl feels like a girl"" **_does not
imply_** that this feeling is stable. He or she may feel like a girl for an
afternoon, for a week, a year, or 5 years.

"An essential part of the interpretative context is surely Pope Francis'
Apostolic Exhortation 'Evangelii Gaudium': 'On the Proclamation of the Gospel
in Today's World' - considered a keynote document of his pontificate, and
running to 288 numbered paragraphs. Less authoritative and isolated statements
should be interpreted in the light of more authoritative and extended
statements such as this.  
  
A few quotes:  
  
‘Throughout the world, let us be “permanently in a state of mission”.’ (25;
cf. passim)  
  
‘All the baptized, whatever their position in the Church or their level of
instruction in the faith, are agents of evangelization.’ (120)  
  
‘All revealed truths derive from the same divine source and are to be believed
with the same faith…’ (36)  
  
‘Of course, we will never be able to make the Church’s teachings easily
understood or readily appreciated by everyone. Faith always remains something
of a cross; it retains a certain obscurity which does not detract from the
firmness of its assent.’ (42)  
  
‘Proclaiming the Gospel message to different cultures also involves
proclaiming it to professional, scientific and academic circles. This means an
encounter between faith, reason and the sciences with a view to developing new
approaches and arguments on the issue of credibility, a creative apologetics
which would encourage greater openness to the Gospel on the part of all. When
certain categories of reason and the sciences are taken up into the
proclamation of the message, these categories then become tools of
evangelization; water is changed into wine.’ (132)  
  
‘Evangelization with joy becomes beauty in the liturgy, as part of our daily
concern to spread goodness. The Church evangelizes and is herself evangelized
through the beauty of the liturgy, which is both a celebration of the task of
evangelization and the source of her renewed self-giving.’ (24)  
  
‘As the bishops of the United States of America have rightly pointed out,
while the Church insists on the existence of objective moral norms which are
valid for everyone, there are those in our culture who portray this teaching
as unjust, that is, as opposed to basic human rights. Such claims usually
follow from a form of moral relativism that is joined, not without
inconsistency, to a belief in the absolute rights of individuals.’ (64)  
  
‘Among the vulnerable for whom the Church wishes to care with particular love
and concern are unborn children, the most defenceless and innocent among us.
Nowadays efforts are made to deny them their human dignity and to do with them
whatever one pleases, taking their lives and passing laws preventing anyone
from standing in the way of this. Frequently, as a way of ridiculing the
Church’s effort to defend their lives, attempts are made to present her
position as ideological, obscurantist and conservative. Yet this defence of
unborn life is closely linked to the defence of each and every other human
right… This is not something subject to alleged reforms or “modernizations”.
It is not “progressive” to try to resolve problems by eliminating a human
life.’ (213)  
  
‘A facile syncretism would ultimately be a totalitarian gesture on the part of
those who would ignore greater values of which they are not the masters. True
openness involves remaining steadfast in one’s deepest convictions, clear and
joyful in one’s own identity, while at the same time being “open to
understanding those of the other party” and “knowing that dialogue can enrich
each side” (John Paul II). What is not helpful is a diplomatic openness which
says “yes” to everything in order to avoid problems, for this would be a way
of deceiving others and denying them the good which we have been given to
share generously with others. Evangelization and interreligious dialogue, far
from being opposed, mutually support and nourish one another.’ (251)  
  
All this may not resolve all the issues with things Francis has said and done,
but it needs to be taken into account.  ",4005
"""It's that there is no good reason to believe something exists for which there
is no evidence.""  
  
Well, now Mr. Jindra, why don't you tell us what counts as evidence and how
you arrived at the conclusion that your proposal is true. What I suspect you
mean by evidence is ""empircally verifiable"". In other words, it has to be
something that you can see to count as evidence. Or put in the terms of the
debate it has to be material to count as evidence. So for someone to show you
that the immaterial exists, you need them to show it to you in material form.
Well that makes about as much sense as you standing behind the podium doing

In philosophy 101 and basic logic, students learn that this is called ""begging
the question"". You are assuming the very thing that needs to be proven and you
are requiring that this assumption also be taken by others as the only means
to show you that it is not true. Oh what a wicked web we weave.

*not verifiable by its own criteria*. Those insisting upon it are either
unreflective or like to impose heavy burdens on the backs of others that they
themselves don't have to carry. Reminds me of some folks in the Gospels that

atheism to theism (i.e by the way of philosophical reason and a lot of time
studying those matters) and I think to myself: ""look at the certain look in
the eyes of this man and how he defends the arguments he exposes"". I know that
for a philosopher a straight face and seriousness don't mean that the argument
is, in fact, good, but for the average joe like me, the impressions mean a lot
(especially from a guy that comes from the other team i.e the atheist side
because there must be some serious argument that made him change his mind in
the first place). I think that you guys may understand what I want to say now.
At the end of the day, every man wishes to learn the truth and die with it.  
  
I don't know what to say. At Ed's blog, I somehow feel at home - even though I
feel a lot of shame and fear of people mocking me and not taking me seriously,
for example - it's hard to talk about that at least for me. But I swear to God
that that's how I feel and in some way, that's why I'm somehow tied to
buddhism because it ''ties'' my intellect into it i.e ""what if that insane
ideology is true at the end of the day?"" But the fact is still I'm too stupid
and incapable of wrapping my head around it alone (keep in mind that I do not
believe in buddhism, as I said, I'm just afraid of something bizarre as that
is true).  
  
So, @Michael and @Talmid - I don't even know how to ask it without sounding,
even more, idiot but I need to - there is a way to know for certain that
nothing that may come in the future or whatever may affect the doctrine of Act
and Potency, Substance, etc.? There is something that might turn all of that
wrong or its stands or falls without being affected ever by the outward
disciplines of science? Because it sounds like something we could know for
sure but that's what afraid me: is there something that might be ""discovered""
that might falsify all of that beautiful work?",3247
"DrYogami,  
  
Yes, I am describing something more like neuroscience -- as a matter of fact,
exactly like that or electronic logic gates. I have no problem defining logic
as ""a science that deals with the principles and criteria of validity of
inference and demonstration: the science of the formal principles of
reasoning."" That definition doesn't imply logic is extra-material any more
than Merriam-Webster's definition of biology implies living organisms are
extra-material (""a branch of knowledge that deals with living organisms and
vital processes""). IOW, ""formal principles of reasoning"" are based on
materialistic processes that even a simple computer can execute.  
  
  
One cannot talk about materialism without a super-naturalism making its
metaphysical entrance. It needs a dichotomy to be meaningful.  
  
Merriam-Webster defines materialism as: ""a theory that physical matter is the
only or fundamental reality and that all being and processes and phenomena can
be explained as manifestations or results of matter."" I don't need to prove
that this is metaphysically true to use it as a basis for understanding
chemistry. But I can still use it as a tool for that understanding, even while
formally unproven. I guess an analogy to what I'm saying would be this: I
don't need to prove a hammer exists before I use it. I don't even need to
prove it's the best tool for the job before I use it. That's why I say I don't
need to make arguments that materialism is true. It does the job and that's
enough. It helps that I have not yet seen a working explanation by any other
means.

"Someone explain ""measure"" to me in Aquinas. Like I'm five. Well maybe 25. This
section of De Veritate for example:  
  
Note, however, that a thing is referred differently to the practical intellect
than it is to the speculative intellect. Since the practical intellect causes
things, it is a measure of what it causes. But, since the speculative
intellect is receptive in regard to things, it is, in a certain sense, moved
by things and consequently measured by them. It is clear, therefore, that, as
is said in the Metaphysics, natural things from which our intellect gets its
scientific knowledge measure our intellect. Yet these things are themselves
measured by the divine intellect, in which are all created things—just as all
works of art find their origin in the intellect of an artist. The divine
intellect, therefore, measures and is not measured; a natural thing both
measures and is measured; but our intellect is measured, and measures only
artifacts, not natural things.  
  
Is a measure, measures, is measured...what is happening? I think ""measure"" and
I picture someone with a ruler walking up to a sofa or whatever and thinking:
I wonder if that will fit in my living room. Hm. I will measure it and then we
will see. That's it. But Aquinas is taking some basic meaning of this word and
extending it to a host of other things, and I can't quite grasp what that is.
""Measure"" turns up in a lot of his writing, and whenever it does, I just
think: Oh no, not that again. There's a lock on that term in my head and I
can't find the key.",1550

It should be mentioned that the quote on the understanding to be given to the
term 'proselytism' when it appears in Church documents, taken from a 2007 CDF
document under Benedict XVI ('Doctrinal Note on some Aspects of
Evangelization'), is a footnote (49) from a text whose main body is entirely
devoted to the legitimacy of sharing one's faith.  
  
Even in ordinary language, the term 'proselytism' does have a vaguely negative
connotation these days, so it is fair enough that the Church has chosen to
deploy it to denote negative ways of promoting the faith, while giving this
clarifying definition in the 2007 document.  
  
The same magisterial document explains: ‘Everywhere and always, each Catholic
has the right and the duty to give the witness and the full proclamation of
his faith. With non-Catholic Christians, Catholics must enter into a
respectful dialogue of charity and truth, a dialogue which is not only an
exchange of ideas, but also of gifts, in order that the fullness of the means
of salvation can be offered to one’s partners in dialogue. In this way, they
are led to an ever deeper conversion to Christ…The work of ecumenism does not
remove the right or take away the responsibility of proclaiming in fullness
the Catholic faith to other Christians, who freely wish to receive it.’ (12)

"Dr. Feser,  
  
I have a two-part question. First, I work as a data scientist/statistician in
the field of solid organ transplantation, and I recently learned that living
uterus donation is possible. As far as I can tell, the Perverted Faculty
Argument (which you lay out in your lecture at Princeton University) would
apply to living uterus donation just as it does to contraception, and
therefore from a Natural Law perspective (and Catholic perspective) living
uterus donation would not be permissible. Is that correct?  
  
Assuming so, I'm thinking about what that implies regarding my role in organ
transplantation, and whether it would be wrong of me to engage in research
that could promote that practice. In other words, if I were asked to do some
kind of analysis regarding living uterus donation, is that proximate enough to
the act itself that I should avoid participating in it?  
  
Thanks!",904
"(I will continue)  
  
And to be fair, this all has to do with the doctrine of momentariness (and
once again, read the chapter 4 from the Siderits book I've just mentioned or
the Jay Garfield one, which has a chapter just for that).  
  
But it's important though that for buddhists things have no motion since
motion would imply substances or something that survives. And that's where I
collapse because I'm not so good in A-T meta to explain all the problems with
the argument that Siderits sets out in the book. Unfortunately - but sincerely
- I can only feel that something is very wrong (and I'm not proud of not
pointing out what is it). But I can at least think that is by making seriously
controversial claims like ""things produce their effects and them go out of
existence"" that the argument supposedly has some weight. But even if that's
so, it's not clear that that could not be interpreted as an ephemeral
substance (the ones that Ed exemplifies when talking about when explaining
prime matter in Scholastic's Meta) for example.  
  
But one thing that puzzles me a lot about buddhism - without even mentioning
their purported attempt to show that they are ""not eliminativists"" about
persons, but that persons just are ""useful fictions"". Is how they square to
the fact from impermanence of all phenomena with things like semantics,
language, or words. After all, they wrote a book arguing that people do not
exist (or exist just conventionally because nothing lasts for more than a
moment) exactly in a language that exist (with modifications, of course) since
the 5th century i.e English. And that's what makes me puto ('pissed') with it
because the evidence against their position it seems to be everywhere but they
never want to look at it. And to say that since all phenomena are impermanent,
so language and semantics are just conventionally true but not ultimately true
just raises the question of how it is even possible in principle for something
that is impermanent and shouldn't last for more than a moment gives the
impression of permanence in the first place? To put it simply how could
impermanent and momentary things could even in principle brought up the
illusion of permanence if they are impermanent? Because if they want to
salvage their position they would necessarily argue that the idea of
permanence in the conscience, memory, and objects from everyday life are just
illusions.

"Question: As a Catholic philosopher, what is your take on William James and
pragmatism?",87
"Dear @Talmid and @Michael Copas  
  
I don't even know how to start this without sounding strange (to say the
least) but based on what I was saying in the latter post about my OCD and
depression, and the friendly incentive from Michael to talk about this in some
way... so I am here trying to expose the arguments that I try to make my OCD
go away with this topic off buddhism.  
  
To understand the buddhist position I make an extreme amount of effort (due to
how I felt every time I came in contact with it and due to the fact that I'm
just a normal guy) and based myself on some works but most specifically: Jay
L. Garfield ""engaging buddhism: why it matters to philosophy"" and Mark
Siderits ""how things are: an introduction to buddhist metaphysics""  
  
Things to notice about buddhism, in general, is the thesis that they subscribe
to mereological nihilism, momentariness (nothing exists more than an instant),
nominalism (or conceptualism depending on the 'school'), and what they call
""anti-substancehood"".  
  
If someone is a philosopher (a true philosopher, not a continental one) I do
recommend reading the Mark Siderits one since it is a defense of buddhist
metaphysics positions in all its aspects (the book cover even says that it is
''buddhist philosophy for philosophers"", so let's commit the fallacy of
authority here). So a literate philosopher (not some random guy like me) could
see the full picture i.e how far can the arguments go in a necessary way and
if they were to be coherent at all at the end of the day. Btw, Ed, I hope that
you're reading this.  
  
So, the major differences between their position and ours are that:  
  
1 - they collapse the distinction of act and potency (e.g for something to
exist is for it to ""keep producing"" its effects in some way continuously, they
use the example of a sprout saying that if the sprout is permanent and not
momentary it should keep producing its effect continuously).  
  
2 - they take universals to be ""abstract"" and ""causally ineffective"". Their
idea of causality resembles a lot a proto-humean one (like its some kind of
idea of the mind conjoining things together).  
  
3 - they do not even address the Aristotelian sense of substance at all and
collapse its position with bare substrata. Since this is a ""serious charge"" I
will quote a footnote from the Siderits book: ""I am here using “substance” in
the Lockean sense of the “something know not what” that underlies and supports
an object’s properties. This usage is common to both Aristotle and Nyāya.""
(footnote 16, page 65 of the book I've mentioned above).  
  
(I will continue)",2618
"(Continuation)  
  
So not just it's unfair and wrong to say that ""this usage is common to
Aristotle"" but one thing that I noticed in the book of both authors is the
somewhat intentional sidestep or ""shell game"" of problems - like they were
trying intentionally guide the book in a way to evade potential questions to
their points. To be fair, Siderits tried to address some points of that (I do
recommend the reading of the Chapter 4 since the most relevant discussion of
points that could be related to our philosophy concentrates there). But his
position simply gives me the impression that he tries to misplace the
substance into its parts (like a shell game) and then comes to the conclusion
that the substance could not exist. In responding to how accidents are always
found in the substances (he does not use the term accidents, I'm using it to
simplify) if they do not exist, he says:  
  
""Consider the water atom as an allegedly indivisible substance in which inhere
the qualities of color, shape, wetness and mass. Resistance to the notion that
these qualities may be thought of as its parts comes from the intuition that
qualities do not simply float freely in the air, that they must be tethered to
something that then explains their occurrence together with other qualities.
Bundle theorists are typically asked to provide the principle of qualitative
unity that would explain the co- occurrence of many qualities in the absence
of a substance in which they inhere. The Buddhist bundle theorist says this is
the wrong question to be asking. Instead we should ask why, in the absence of
empirical evidence for the existence of substances as distinct from their
properties, we nonetheless have the intuition that substances are required to
explain qualitative unity."" (pp. 59)  
  
To say that ""in the absence of empirical evidence"" is just to beg the
question. but he goes on to say:  
  
""By hypothesis, color, shape, wetness, and mass tropes are compresent at a
certain spatio- temporal location. This much both sides can agree on. Here is
a possible explanation of the fact that we commonly take these to all be
properties of a single thing, the water atom. When we wish to specify the
location of this mass trope, it is easier to indicate it by using the term
“water atom” than by indicating each of the three other tropes present at that
location. This makes the communication process more efficient. It also
relieves us of the burden of ascertaining just which other tropes are present
at that location, given that we know from past experience that mass tropes are
generally accompanied by other tropes in a certain range. “Water atom”
functions as a convenient designator for a certain bundle of tropes (TS 832–
34; TSP ad TS 581– 83). That they make up a bundle has as much to do with us
and our interests and cognitive limitations as it does with how things are in
the  
world. The world as it is anyway contributes the fact of their compresence.
The rest— their being unified by their joint inherence in a substance— is our
doing. The Buddhist doctrine of the two truths is their answer to the bundle
theorist’s problem of unification.""  
  
Basically, he uses their conventionalist position to ""explain"" how we construe
substances from things that are nothing but tropes.

Fair enough. While giving the clarification. But then again: _Not_ fair enough

And for particulars: one specific example used, of preaching for the ""gospel
of prosperity"", I would argue is **not** a sound example. The pope argues that
their interpretation of the gospel is in error, and their manner of persuading
is unjust. As to the latter - maybe so, although I would want to see specifics
to see what, precisely, is unjust. As to their erroneous interpretation - that
is so, but (in many cases, though admittedly not in all) the preachers are
_sincere_ in their misguided grasp of the gospel. So their error on this is in
no way more damaging to the mere fact of their trying to persuade others, than
is that of mainline Protestant churches, who also are in error in their
interpretation of the gospels. The pope's singling out the mainline
Protestants as being ""OK"", and the gospel of prosperity preachers being mean
nasty ""proselytizers"" is - on this score - not consistent.  
  
The real problem with the BAD kind of proselytism is that it uses as
persuasive forces things that _should not_ be used so. It may use false
premises. Or false logic. Or appeal to emotional ""motives"" that are not
founded on reasonable bases. Or unreasonable threats of bad outcomes ""if you
don't convert"". But mainline Protestants have used these tools also: e.g. they
have used false premises in falsely characterizing the _Catholic_ teachings
from which they depart. (E.G. ""Catholics worship Mary"".)  
  
These kinds of tools are wrongly used in _Catholic_ hands, too, so it's not
the _true proposition_ on account of which they are employed that is the
problem with them, it is the manner in which they act on the hearer to cause
belief.  
  
Like with all the other times Francis has played funny games with the truth:
it's not that his words cannot be understood - with added clarifications -
that makes them fit well with Catholic teaching overall. It's that he
persistently chooses to present so many of them in obscuring, confusing,
problematic ways, and he rarely bothers to clarify later himself, leaving it
to other organs of the Vatican to suggest clarifications, while he goes on
blythely generating more confusing commentary. The issue with ""God intends a
plurality of religions"" stuff is a perfect example: he went beyond appropriate
bounds in a public document, his curia ""corrected"" the sense of the passage so
as to mitigate the problem, and then later he again in signing yet another
public document with the same sort of obscurantist language.  
  
Francis has publicly ""justified"" his so-called ""carelessness"" in these
confusing sayings / teachings, by _saying_ that he is careless. But from the
fact that the errors and obscurantism all plays to one angle, it isn't truly
an accidental kind of carelessness. And anyway, if a person knows he is
careless in off-the-cuff remarks, (a) that does not excuse him from _not
refraining_ from making such remarks where he could sow problems, and (b) it
does not excuse him with respect to written documents published after (what
should be) careful consideration. Francis can easily evade charges of heresy
by pointing to his carelessness. He cannot easily evade charges of
**negligence** by pointing to his carelessness.",3695

The point Michael made about sane mind is true. Because when you read all that
deplorable doctrines (I am using doctrines for the other philosophical views
like reductionism, buddhism, etc.) there's no way your mind not being
affected. Not because they are too counterintuitive - even though that is true
- but because of the derailment of reason and the bizarre (to say the least)
conclusions.  
  
When I found Ed's blog and learned a little bit more about act and potency
(keep in mind that we don't have that in Brazil, at least I never found it
anywhere through my youth or academic life) there is a certain beauty in the
doctrine of Aristotle - not in the sense of ""wow, after all that bullsh*t I
found across the internet like reductionism and etc. there is finally
something sane"" - but most especially in the way that the doctrine fits with
itself i.e in the way that is constructed (the careful appreciation of every
matter and etc.). But most importantly that gave me hope. And that is
something I can't forget. Because at least it seemed plausible at the time.  
  
But I want to confess something. Even though I never was an atheist throughout
my life, I never had strong reasons to believe in Our Father. That's no
surprise that I became a skeptical pseudo-atheist through my 19's. In a sense,
I think my skepticism is a disease that I can't get rid of and that grow to
the point that made my life in the miserable condition that I am now. That's
hard to say but I swear to God that that's true.  
  
The one (and the only one to be honest) reason for all of that is the fact
that I am afraid of believing some falsity and dying without knowing the
truth. I know that sounds really dumb for a motive but on closer analysis, I'm
pretty sure that 99% of atheists and co. minds work like that too. That's why
I am that way. The origin of that was the fact that part of my family is
''Espirita'' (if you guys don't have that crap religion there is a mixture of
cartesian res cogitans plus the movie ghost from Patrick Swayze) and for a
long time I was surrounded by 'palatable' ideas like: ""after death, there is a
soul in the same form as your body that will come out of it and live forever"".
I know that sounds stupid but as a kid in my 14-15years, I thought that that
was true. It 'tasted' good because, you know, nobody wants to die. But the
point is my intellect was so suffocated by that that I truly believed that in
some way I ""was a soul"".

months. (Reading through his works by genre). When I got to his non-fiction
""popular works"" (such as Mere Christianity, Miracles, etc.), I was surprised
that his descriptions of God sound similar to the Classical Theist
understanding of God. (At least in some cases). Below are a few quotes from
Lewis's books (possibly) showing this.  
  
For each quote, the name of the book (and chapter) comes first.  
  
In this first quote when Lewis uses the word ""Dualism"" he means ""Cosmic
Dualism"" (the belief in 2 equal opposite powers that control the universe, one
good and the other evil), not ""Substance Dualism"". In this article he's
responding to C. E. M. Joad, a British philosopher who was arguing in favor of
Cosmic Dualism. (Lewis wrote this essay while WWII was happening).  
  
(God in the Dock, Part 1, Chapter 1 ""Evil and God"")  
(Quote)  
""We are left then to choose between monotheism and dualism—between a single,
good, almighty source of being, and two equal, uncreated, antagonistic Powers,
one good and the other bad. Dr. Joad suggests that the latter view stands to
gain from the ‘new urgency’ of the fact of evil. But what new urgency? Evil
may seem more urgent to us than it did to the Victorian philosophers—favoured
members of the happiest class in the happiest country in the world at the
world’s happiest period. But it is no more urgent for us than for the great
majority of monotheists all down the ages. The classic expositions of the
doctrine that the world’s miseries are compatible with its creation and
guidance by a wholly good Being come from Boethius waiting in prison to be
beaten to death and from St Augustine meditating on the sack of Rome. The
present state of the world is normal; it was the last century that was the
abnormality.  
This drives us to ask why so many generations rejected Dualism. Not,
assuredly, because they were unfamiliar with suffering; and not because its
obvious prima facie plausibility escaped them. It is more likely that they saw
its two fatal difficulties, the one metaphysical, and the other moral.  
The metaphysical difficulty is this. The two Powers, the good and the evil, do
not explain each other. Neither Ormuzd nor Ahriman can claim to be the
Ultimate. More ultimate than either of them is the inexplicable fact of their
being there together. Neither of them chose this tête-à-tête. Each of them,
therefore, is conditioned—finds himself willy-nilly in a situation; and either
that situation itself, or some unknown force which produced that situation, is
the real Ultimate. Dualism has not yet reached the ground of being. You cannot
accept two conditioned and mutually independent beings as the self-grounded,
self-comprehending Absolute. On the level of picture-thinking this difficulty
is symbolised by our inability to think of Ormuzd and Ahriman without
smuggling in the idea of a common space in which they can be together and thus
confessing that we are not yet dealing with the source of the universe but
only with two members contained in it. Dualism is a truncated metaphysic.""

difficult of depending on metaphysical thesis that some non-theists would not
be willing to accept, one being that there is good and bad, these not being
relative. I even remember a guy who posted here who did believe in a First
Cause but not really in God. This made me think of this:  
  
Suppose that one believes in a First Cause that has something like a intellect
and a will, even being omniscient, but who also is a moral nihilist, so this
Cause is not considered divine.  
  
To this view to work, the Cause would need to choose to create this world, of
course, but how would this happens? To make a choice, one needs to intend
something, but if there are in reality no good or bad things them why would
the First Cause intend anything?  
  
It can't be because the Cause make the mistake of thinking that somethings are
good, for we are dealing with a omnipotent being.  
  
It can't be because the Cause has a tendency to choose this or that, for our
own tendencies are caused by our bodily constitution and by our intellect
limitations, both things the First Cause is free from.  
  
It seems to me them that if one is willing to accept a First Cause them either
there are better goals than others, so things are better or worser than others

My point doesn't depend on whether Aristotle had a doctrine of prime matter,
since the discussion was about Aristotelians, who historically do. But for the
Aristotelians historically, 'prime matter' was just the term for things to
which Aristotle certainly refers: the matter underlying elemental change
(e.g., 305a), that of which even substance is predicated (e.g., 1029a), that
which is the first in the order of material causes because of the
impossibility of an infinite regress (e.g., 994a-b). (The last of these is
what led people to talk of 'prime matter' at all.)",588

rather appallingly blythe about risks, it also (seemingly) would greatly
reduce the weight of the argument about Jane ""maiming"" herself: it's not
permanent. She gets her faculty back, intact.  
  
Maybe this is all not reasonably ""worth"" the financial costs to the system of

properties. If you scrap matter for just another kind of form then you have a
Parmenedian static universe. If this conclusion doesn’t follow from your new

Potency is not mysterious, it’s almost the exact same meaning as when average
men say something has “potential.” And I highly disagree that essence and

The ancients like Plato and Aristotle were much better at being in touch with
intuitive knowledge and deepening their understanding of what is already
implicit in our mind (I.e. growing of wisdom) rather than the contemporary
philosophical practice of over-analyzing to the point of doubting the obvious.
The contemporary philosopher is rigorously trained to over-analyze and cut
himself off from the original source of information (e.g.Descartes, Kant,
pansyschism, etc.), so I caution against the accusation that Plato, Aristotle,
or Aquinas were mysterious or artificial in their thinking when it is probably

"The reason there is such a category as “heresy” in Christianity, whereas there
is no such category in purely philosophical systems, is that Christianity
claims to be grounded in special divine revelation. Anything that purports to
be a Christian position must be consistent with that revelation, and the
notion of heresy is the notion of that which is not consistent with it. Now, a
Christian theologian who is accused of heresy might, of course, reasonably
question whether the charge is just. He can try to show that his position is,
when correctly understood, compatible with Christian revelation. But what he
_cannot_ reasonably do is dismiss considerations of orthodoxy and heresy _tout
court_. Again, by virtue of calling himself a Christian, he is committed to
staying within the bounds of the revelation, and thus avoiding heresy. And
thus he is committed to acknowledging that to accuse a fellow Christian of
heresy _is indeed an argument_. It may or may not at the end of the day be a
_good_ argument, but it is an argument.",1034

"Just as a summary to tie a bow on things: the reason that it is not reasonable
to hope for the salvation for all is twofold. First, negatively, we have no
good reason to think that all will be saved. Second, positively, we have
testimony of Scripture as interpreted by the greatest doctors of the Church
and the weight of the Church fathers denying the position of Origen. From this
weight of this tradition, we find nothing like VB's mere wish given the
misnomer ""hope"" (which is a theological virtue). Where then did VB get his
inspiration for this position: again, as I noted above, it was influenced by
Barth who had little role for cooperation with grace in his thought. From his
foregone position, VB misrepresented the weight of tradition in the reading of
the Church Fathers. He did not find something that no other theologian had
seen that was actually present in the tradition. He creatively misrepresented
the tradition to bend his ""research"" in the direction of foregone conclusions.  
  
So, in the spirit of your suggestion above, if you wish to part company with
the great saints and doctors noted above in order to keep company with Origen,
Barth, and Balthasar: ""that is your decision"". It is a bad decision, but it is
surely yours if you make it.",1264

repudiation of the Church, and embraces the Church willingly, regardless of
how little time there is between their repenting and their death, (i.e.
regardless of whether their conversion could be known by outward signs because
there is so little time).""

might just end up in heaven. The possibility of conversion prior to death is

the recent disciples of VB that those who believe that hell is and will be
occupied want people to be in hell. They are like greedy misers counting
coins, but instead they are counting the number of souls in hell and
delighting in every enumeration of an additional soul. Those who make these
calumnious accusations will answer to the judge of the living and the dead
whether or not they believe in the final judgement. Uncharitable habits such
as these occur again in the writings of David Hart. The convenient thing about
being a universalist is that you can ignore Christ’s commandment to love your
neighbor in charitable discourse and can look upon everyone who disagrees with
you as an idiot. The inconvenient part about being a universalist is that you
will answer to the judge of the living and the dead for the damnable
consequences of such a lack of charity. In my estimation, the inconvenient
part heavily outweighs the convenient part.  
  
So now to address this calumny. The reason that I care about this issue is the
same reason that the popes who condemned positions like what I noted above
cared about them. I care about the issue because I care about souls and it is
extremely dangerous for people to believe that no one will (or may) ultimately
be in hell. It makes Christ's warnings vacuous. I makes the two ways noted in
the Didache and the warning abouts life and death in Deuteronomy vacuous. A
child that knows his dad will never spank him even though the dad threatens a
spanking will at least be tempted to despise his father knowing that he will
never make good on his threats. Viewing God as an indulgent of our sins such
that He makes threats that will never be realized in any instance is
completely absurd. it is for this reason that the position of VB is absurd. As
I noted to start with, It is rooted in neither reason nor revelation. There is
more to address in your post, but I will again have to save it for when I have

means is simply that creation derives from God, albeit of necessity. Yet it is

of necessity begotten by the Father; and if it isn’t different, then creation
is no less divine than the Son is_.",573

follow the narrow path, will ultimately land themselves precisely on that path
without the slightest effort? So, Christ will save them without their willing
to be saved? Well, that is contrary to Catholic teaching as Trent taught
definitively that we must cooperate with God's grace.

souls come from? Two hypotheses. God creates them de novo or they are created

answer here. Aristotle in De Anima claims soul is hylomorphic. Form of a
substance. Man has the form of intelligence, reason. Which Aristotle claims is
eternal, immortal and can exist without a substance, a body. A rather

could prove a soul exists, its nature, or how it interacts with physical

little.The Bible says litle about the concept of soul. By contrast, the
ancient Greeks speculated quite a bit on the concept. Trying to trace the
development of the concept of the human soul in early Jewish though to early
Christian though is a sparse puzzle. I have been meaning to some day to check
the Dead Sea Scroll Essene works to see if that had any mentions of Essene
theories of human souls.

"Tanner, perhaps you should read it a 16th time. Yes, Vatican I is describing
exactly the same view as Hart's, but is _condemning_ it. It is not saying that
God creates the world as necessarily as he necessarily loves himself, but on
the contrary it is saying that anyone who holds such a view is anathema.

"@anonymous.  
  
What does or does not ""seem heretical"" to you is not the criteria by which
something is or is not heretical. The position you are describing is a
position that has been condemned by the Church. Pope Pius IX condemened the
following proposition in the the Syllabus of Errors: ""Good hope at least is to
be entertained of the eternal salvation of all those who are not at all in the
true Church of Christ"" (17). This condemnation draws from a previous
encyclical entitled Quanto Conficiamur.  
  
So the suggestion that there is good reason to hope for the salvation of all
men has been condemned by the Church. Balthasar was aware of this and would
not have gone so far as to say that we have good reason to hope for the
salvation of everyone. To make this assertion is again to affirm what the
Church has condemned.  
  
Where does this leave the position of Balthasar? It leaves him with a hope
that is based neither in reason nor in revelation. It leaves him with an
irrational hope. That is the problem with the position: it is rooted neither
in reason nor revelation.  
  
In the Tradition, the overwhelming weight of the Church Fathers is against the
positions of Gregory of Nyssa and Origen and a couple of clever theologians do
not overturn the weight of a broad range of Church Fathers that includes a
great number of doctors of the Church.  
  
It certainly doesn't overturn the words of Christ that ""the way is narrow and
*few will find it*"" (Mt. 7:14). These words are not taken seriously by those
in the Balthasar camp. Balthasar's position on this issue was influenced by
the reformed theologian Karl Barth. Such theologians have an account of
election that has little place for human freedom and secondary causality. They
read salvation as though God will save us without us. This is not the Catholic
position. The Catholic position is that we need to cooperate with God's grace
to be saved.  
  
So, the Balthasarian position in order to remain orthodox on this point would
have to posit that we should hope that everyone in history has, is, and will
cooperate with God's grace. Well, we might ask the disciples of Balthasar,
what reason do we have for thinking that everyone in the world has, is, and
will cooperate with God's grace? Oh, you don't have a good reason to think
that? Well why in the world would I hold a position that has no rational basis
and is widely rejected by the Church Fathers? Why would I hold a position that
is so manifestly contrary to the state of our corrupt society? It don't have
to even know about the gulags to see that the suggestion that everyone is
cooperating with God's grace is an entirely baseless assertion. I just have to
look around me.",2711

on the road early, and then get off it early and live saintly lives. Francis

"@Tanner  
Your second DBH quote is bunk. Turn to the first option he attacks, and ask
what it means for a potential to be “beyond” the divine nature. I think his
second prong suggests he is using “beyond” to mean “distinct from”. For, to
reach his conclusion, this internal, unrealized potency must mean something
that truly is part of God, thus undermining several essential attributes.  
If I’m interpreting him correctly, I can’t help but wonder, what’s the
problem? It shouldn’t be that God is realizing what could be called an
objective potency. I see three possibilities for how that might threaten God’s
claims to divinity:  
1\. It undermines his aseity  
2\. It threatens his immutability  
3\. It does away with his simplicity  
But it’s far from clear that realizing an objective potency does any of those
things. There’s no reason to suppose that making a choice involves any kind of
change on the choosing agent’s part, for example.  
And we can already see why divine aseity goes on unscathed. An “objective
potency”, as I’ve dubbed it here, takes it for granted that the possible thing
doesn’t actually exist. It’s merely a possibility, for something that isn’t
self-existing. Or are we supposed to think that because God is the ultimate
ground for modality, that every objective potency is just one of God’s passive
potencies? Is there any reason to believe that? I won’t take it just because
you want me to.",1424

departure from the explicit teachings of Christ"", which would only include
supporters of capital punishment, right-wing Catholic integralists,
libertarians, and Trump supporters. ""Beyond these obvious examples,"" Hart
argues. ""judgement is best withheld.""  
  
In other words, anyone who ventures far from what Hart takes to be Jesus'
moral mission (and keep in mind, Hart believes Jesus to have been an anarcho-
communist agitator) can be an obvious heretic. For everyone else, it's all up
in the air. The criteria for Christian theological orthodoxy in Hart's eyes
appears to be left-wing political orthodoxy.",759

arbitrary decision among opposed possibilities – would be an impossible defect
of his freedom. God does not require the indeterminacy of the possible in

freedom and necessity simply disappears; there is no problem to be resolved

distinction is meaningless._",483

Michael says:

interpreted: ""You don't really need to make any effort at all because everyone
will (or might) get into heave without being on the path or without trying.""_  
  
Nope. Not what I am saying - I think there are people in Hell. Nor is it what
**must** be said of those who suggest the _possibility_ that many / most / all
accept the grace of repentance just before death. Suppose you are a smoker,
and confessor tells you: ""give up smoking, or you're going to spend 300
billion years in Purgatory suffering pains 10 times the worst pain you have
ever felt so far"". The warning is given in the most urgent possible terms:
DON'T BE AN IDIOT - the pleasures of a few more years of smoking just aren't
worth that amount of suffering! Go the strait and narrow path now, to avoid
that horrible period of suffering.  
  
Again, I don't think that's what Christ meant. The issue isn't simply **what's
the most reasonable reading, but rather _is there ANY_ room at all for a

"It's strange how Western converts to the Orthodox Church so often seem to take
up its least orthodox strands. Is it all about boredom with sana doctrina?
There are pious Orthodox monks who spout theories like everything going to
heaven, the devil too. But then, that religion has had no mechanism for
establishing what Revelation is since slamming the door a thousand years
ago,so such views go on without too much disturbance. Even so, the average
cradle follower of Orthodoxy seems little interested in most of the stranger
theories - as long as he doesn't start getting ""ideas"".  
  
By the way, it's hard to see why Christianity's grounds should be termed
revelation of a special kind. Are there there any decisive grounds for this
religion apart from those beyond the capabilities of human nature? The
revelation that makes Christianity possible is supernatural of itself, with no
confusion with what men can to discover through their own potential, which is
why the term is universally used without qualification, and perfectly
understood and accepted. The addition ""special"" in connection with the

"Okay now to address your scenario. You are asking whether the scenario you
describe is possible. Here we have to make a distinction between something
being logically possible and something that is actually the case. The scenario
you describe is logically possible in the same way that it is logically
possible that God could have made unicorns. However, framing it this way and
then going on to say that we should hope for this is analagous to suggesting
that we should hope for the existence of unicorns.  
  
The question is not whether it is logically possible in the strict sense. The
question is: what from reason or revelation has led you to think that this is
in fact the case? After we have all listened to the crickets for a bit, we
should be able to move on from this question. Instead we have to put up with
folks bending their will to find any figure within the tradition who will
agree with their foregone conclusions.  
  
Their approach is not: what is the weight of Tradition on this question. Their
question is: can I find anyone who agrees with me. Their question is not: how
do I operate within the stream of Tradition making sense of all of Scripture
in light of Tradition and especially in light of the greatest figures in the
Tradition (doctors like St. Thomas, St. Augustine, etc.). Rather their
approach is: how close can I get to affirming something as close to
universalism as possible without actually committing myself to propositions
that have been explicitly condemned. This is *NOT* a catholic approach to
theology.  
  
The problem, however, is even greater than what I have described. It is not
that they have neither reason nor revelation supporting their position and
they choose to believe it anyways. That would be irrational. However something
more is occurring. They actually have both Scripture affirming that few will
find eternal life and the greatest doctors of the Church understanding that
passage in its very obvious sense and they reject this testimony or explain it
away. Again, that is *not* a Catholic approach to theology.  
  
And contrary to the calumnious suggestions otherwise, the concern of those who
are speaking out against these trends is ""pastoral"". Those speaking against
these trends (e.g. Ralph Martin in his book Will Many Be Saved? and Edward
Feser and Fr. Rooney and the Popes who have repeatedly warned about
indifferentism) are motivated precisely out of love for those drawn into
indifference over sin because of these dangerous opinions. Hard to get people
to suffer the embarrassment of a good confession if they think that everyone
is going to heaven regardless. And those who say ""well it is possible that
everyone is going to heaven"" easily move to: most people are in fact going to
heaven for otherwise God would be cruel. I have heard *precisely this
argument* from a prominent adherent of VB and the comment was quickly deleted
after it was posted. The fact that adherents of VB are moving in the direction
of thinking that they know that most people are going to heaven should give
pause to disciples of VB and to those who fawn over sophistry from the pen of
DBH.",3143

language.

_Rooney's article offers nothing new, other than the claim that Hart's
position amounts to ""heresy,"" and where has that accusation ever got anyone?_  
  
Well, no, it DOES offer more than shouting ""heresy"". It offers support for
that assertion from Eastern Fathers and saints, i.e. people that most Orthodox
Christians consider to _matter_ in identifying orthodoxy.  
  
_Hart obviously thinks its more important to be right than to be orthodox._  
  
I dare say you may be right, this is exactly how he thinks of it. And that,
ITSELF, constitutes a non-Christian way of thinking about it: due to Christ's
promises of protection, a Christian ought to be _very_ worried when he
discovers ""I think X"" but ""the orthodox view is not-X"", and ought to hold that
finding the above implies that very likely that he was wrong to think X is
true, because ""orthodoxy"" has protections in getting at truth that I don't
have. Preferring ""what-I-think-is-truth that I arrived at against orthodoxy""
over ""what-orthodoxy-says-is-truth"" is not **merely** ""preferring truth over
orthodoxy"". It constitutes also a position about ""my reliability in getting at
truth"" compared to ""the Church's reliability in getting at truth"". DBH can
hold his view of preferring truth to orthodoxy, and hold to NOT being bothered
about such a condition, but then he ought to _accept_ the comment of others
that this disqualifies him from being a Christian, instead of going off on
multi-page diatribes against them (as he has against Feser on that).",1947

be in conflict. And ""Christ is God"" and ""Mary is Christ's mother"" _seemed_ to

Regarding salvation being contingent on folks repenting: that is true and you

recognizes this and it is irrelevant to the question of whether or not we have
the slightest reason to think that every single soul will repent before death
and end up in heaven. We don't have a shred of evidence for that proposition.
More than this, we have the clear teaching of Christ that many will not repent
as they will follow the broad path that leads to destruction rather than
following the narrow path that leads to life. Again, few will find it.

"Here's a passage from Pope John Paul II's Encyclical Redemptor hominis,
suggesting that babies have sanctifying grace in their souls when those
children still live in the womb. If they do, why baptize them?  
  
""Accordingly, what is in question here is man in all his truth, in his full
magnitude. We are not dealing with the ""abstract"" man, but the real,
""concrete"", ""historical"" man. We are dealing with ""each"" man, for each one is
included in the mystery of the Redemption and with each one Christ has united
himself for ever through this mystery. Every man comes into the world through
being conceived in his mother's womb and being born of his mother, and
precisely on account of the mystery of the Redemption is entrusted to the
solicitude of the Church. Her solicitude is about the whole man and is
focussed on him in an altogether special manner. The object of her care is man
in his unique unrepeatable human reality, which keeps intact the image and
likeness of God himself92. The Council points out this very fact when,
speaking of that likeness, it recalls that ""man is the only creature on earth
that God willed for itself""93. Man as ""willed"" by God, as ""chosen"" by him from
eternity and called, destined for grace and glory-this is ""each"" man, ""the
most concrete"" man, ""the most real""; this is man in all the fullness of the
mystery in which he has become a sharer in Jesus Christ, the mystery in which
each one of the four thousand million human beings living on our planet has
become a sharer from the moment he is conceived beneath the heart of his
mother.""

"I agree that these two positions are distinct and should be kept apart for the
purpose of recognizing whether either one is contrary to _what the Church
teaches_. Von Balthasar's position is much less easy to attack as contrary, or
as clearly and explicitly contrary.  
  
But whether salvation for all it is something that we can ""reasonably"" hope
for is not the same as whether it is clearly and explicitly contrary to what
the Church teaches. Some teachings make it imprudent, unwise, or temerarious
(rash) to propose, without being definitely opposed to Church teaching,
because the Church teaching strongly **leans** in a certain direction without
(yet) being _definitive_ about it. For example, the Holy Office stated over
100 years ago that it MAY NOT safely be taught that Christ in his human
intellect did not have the knowledge of those in Beatitude during his period
on Earth, nor even that the position be held as debatable or uncertain.  
  
In addition to the (many) biblical passages that _at least point toward_ the
result that some are damned, there are some passages whose import are (and
have been taken traditionally as saying) that some are _in fact_ damned,
rather than that some may be damned. And whether they have been
""traditionally"" taught so, versus ""Traditionally"" taught so, i.e. whether the
weight of the apostolic and Fathers teachings' comes down definitively on one
side of that, I hesitate to say, but then again perhaps _so should everyone
else_. It may be **rash** to say (and teach) that all may be saved is a
reasonable hope.  
  
Nevertheless, one may certainly PRAY for all, in the sense of (a) having good
will toward all; and (b) asking God to offer his favor to all; so that (c) all
who _might be saved_ will indeed be saved. While your benevolence applies to
all in that **any one** might be saved, and thus of any one you hope he be
saved, it need not encompass an active hope that _every_ single one be saved.
This benevolence (and it's consequent form of prayer) is an appropriate
expression of charity, being clearly assimilable to God's _antecedent_ will
that all be saved.",2123

Hey bro! I said that they are 'materialists' not in the technical sense, but
because of the consequences. Because for materialists in the technical sense -
if they are to be coherent at all - they should say that people do not exist.
But in the buddhist sense, not only people do not exist and there is just
suffering but the world is always trying to deceive you. I don't need to
canvas it more for you to see how much worse it is. There is simply no
happiness at all and no one to see any good of it. It seems that ideology
takes all of the best in the world and turn it into misery.  
  
In the cellphone example, they somehow believe in regularities but, as far as
I understand, they are very close to the Humean causality type - or proto-
humean. They say that causality is in some sense mind only or something we
'associate' but it's in some sense not really there (I think that's somehow
related to why they are nominalists too). If this is coherent at the end of
the day (I think that it's not) is another story - and that's what I want to
know because something as evil as that CAN'T BE REAL.  
  
During these years I tried to formulate ways in showing how that can't be true
- I will put them in the other post. But man the problem is even if I somehow
'showed' that, I can't prove it to myself. You may think how that's possible
but the problem is the OCD - this thing keeps hitting my head 24/7 and it
seems that I can't go further. Since you don't have it I can describe that it
hits differently. Looks like my arguments are always wrong or that they will
have somehow a way to evade it. For people that do not have it, it seems
ridiculous, but for me, it hits really hard to the point that doesn't matter
how I try to formulate it, and I always forget the rest of the arguments and
need to repeat them to myself. It looks like hell because I'm never out of the
same place and looks like I learn nothing - just keep suffering.

(buddhism) is wrong in the open-topic post. I will try to put my best in there

Thanks to Dr. Feser, I know what an order is in Wullner's sense of that word.
But I doubt that sanctifying grace makes a non-Catholic a member of the
Church.  
  
I doubt that Pope Pius XII and Msgr. Joseph Clifford Fenton tell us the
difference between being a member of the Church and being in the Church as a
nonmember of it.  
  
Pius XII and Fenton say that only Catholics are members of the Church since
each member of it must meet four requirements. He must wear the baptismal mark
on his soul, profess Catholicism, be willing to submit to the pope and to the
Church's other legitimate hierarchy, and not be under full excommunication. By
those standards, a Protestant in sanctifying grace is in the Church as a
nonmember of it.  
  
But the dogma that there's salvation in only the Catholic Church is still true
because people can be in the Church as nonmembers of it.  
  
See Mystici Corporis Christi and Msgr. Joseph Clifford Fenton's book ""The
Catholic Church and Salvation.""  
  
A non-Catholic is in the Church if there's sanctifying grace in his soul. So
he'll die in her if he's in that grace when he does. But his sect doesn't get
him to heaven. If he reaches it, he does that despite that sect, not because
of it.  
  
That's why Blessed Pope Pius IX writes:  
""Our Predecessor, Gregory XVI, an “insanity,”2 viz., that “liberty of
conscience and worship is each man’s personal right, which ought to be legally
proclaimed and asserted in every rightly constituted society; and that a right
resides in the citizens to an absolute liberty, which should be restrained by
no authority whether ecclesiastical or civil, whereby they may be able openly
and publicly to manifest and declare any of their ideas whatever, either by
word of mouth, by the press, or in any other way.” But, while they rashly
affirm this, they do not think and consider that they are preaching “liberty
of perdition;”3 and that “if human arguments are always allowed free room for
discussion, there will never be wanting men who will dare to resist truth, and
to trust in the flowing speech of human wisdom; whereas we know, from the very
teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ, how carefully Christian faith and wisdom
should avoid this most injurious babbling.”4""  
  
From what you're telling me, I must have misinterpreted John Paul's quotation
from Redemptor Hominis. But his Assisi meetings and Vatican II's religious
liberty may make some non-Catholics likely to die outside the Church.

that God cannot positively will evil? No, because we can understand Clement as
meaning, not that God could do evil instead of good, but rather that he could
refrain from acting at all rather than doing some good action.) Bradshaw also
notes that Basil the Great rejects the idea that God creates “without choice,
as the body is the cause of shadow and light the cause of brightness” (where

action, for by His one eternal act of the creation of the world not only the
world starts to be but He also sustain every single creature by His eternal
act. Remember that God is completely outside time and space, so when a human
conception happens He does not look at it and say ""oh,, better create a
soul!"", in a way He already did it.  
  
I know that all this generate several questions, but we do have our boy St.
Thomas, so i really recomend studying the ST part about God and His atributes.

"End quote. Athanasius here distinguishes what comes from God “by nature” from
what comes from Him “by will.” The Son proceeds from the Father by nature,
whereas created things are made according to the divine will. Since what
proceeds from Him by nature is what proceeds _of necessity_ , the implication
is that what comes from God by will does _not_ come from Him of necessity.
Athanasius also says that what comes about by God’s will involves “counsel”
(or “deliberation,” as it has also been translated) and to say that something
comes about this way implies that there could have been some alternative
outcome.",614

defense of universalism in his book _That All Shall Be Saved_ , of which [I
have also been critical](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2020/07/hart-hell-
and-heresy.html). Fr. Rooney sums up his basic argument as follows:",488
"I spoke with David via his sub-stack, and he conflates pantheism with
something called 'process theology' which he rejects. He also denied being a
'panentheist' which he states that ""no one can adequately define."" So, do you
think you maybe misinterpreting David position?",272
"""I explicitly said that I realize that Hart would not be swayed by Catholic
doctrine, and that is why I emphasized instead what we find in scripture and
the Fathers -- which, in other contexts, Hart claims to follow.""  
  
Yeah, nothing to get het up about, I'd say. Other of your readers however,
seem to differ. Vehemently  
  
Some really do seem to get emotional about this. Perhaps they are picturing a
favorite icon like Stalin, or Marx, or even Lyndon Johnson, in Hell; which is
an amusing reaction - the indignation that is - but not really helpful.  
  
Hart has himself shruggingly said, in effect, that if he is a heretic, then,
you know, so be it. He has clearly announced his preference for, and
commitment to, his own pantheibabble eructations over orthodox doctrine; and
he will have it his way - warbling defiance Sinatra style - come Hell or high
water. He's got his ""precious"" and he ain't giving it up. So beautiful, so
shiny, so soothing ... so lovingly and long polished.  
  
Perhaps there is something to be gleaned from the reactions ... after all, the
Virgin Mary of the approved apparitions, herself entreats the various
visionaries to pray for the poor souls on their way to damnation. ""Poor
souls"": that's an interesting way to look at them. I might not care about
their fate, but she does. And I have to admit that according to reports Hell
is indeed a hellish place, which once you gain a whiff of it, you would not
wish on your own worst enemy ... though on these same reports, the residents
of Hell might in fact have wished it for themselves through a rather perverse
celebration of their own unbreakable wills.  
  
And then .. there are those delicate butterflies that swarm to Hart;s defense.  
  
Wherein we see the kind assertions made which involve the fascinating premise
that saying ""all men are categorically saved"", is not the same in the final
logical reduction as saying that ""no men can fail to be saved no matter what
they do"" ... i.e., "" cannot not be saved"", or something along those lines.
There's an important operating distinction there somewhere ... we are assured.
Or, at least it's strongly insinuated. Well, if 'Ye are Gods', then I guess
all things are possible, including the definitionally not possible.  
  
Ed ... How do you deal with it? It's enough to make one an old fashioned
logical positivist ... almost.",2371
" _Good hope at least is to be entertained of the eternal salvation of all
those who are not at all in the true Church of Christ_  
  
""not at all in the true Church of Christ"". At all.  
  
What about those who are ""in the true Church"" in some (qualified) sense and
not in the Church in another sense? These, at least, would seem to constitute
**the very reason** Pius added ""at all"" to the sentence.  
  
Is it **impossible** for God to do the following: for each sinner, one
hundredth of a second before the point the soul leaves the body, take their
faculties up into a confrontation with Him, enlighten them and give them the
grace of conversion, and then while they have sanctifying grace and are thus
""in the true Church of Christ"", die? Each such sinner would die in the true
Church. Is there a limit to how many God has the power save this way?  
  
As I understand it, Pius's named error regards having hope even for those who
reject the Church _all the way_ to their death, so that they die in the
condition of being wholly and in every sense not members of the Church. It
seemingly _does not_ refer to someone who repents of their (earlier)
repudiation of the Church, and embraces the Church willingly, regardless of
how little time there is between their repenting and their death, (i.e.
regardless of whether their conversion could be known by outward signs because
there is so little time).",1404
"""Heresy!"" is often a paltry accusation, and this is no exception. It
immediately raises the question ""Whose heresy? Which orthodoxy?"" and given
that Hart does not claim to be a member of the Catholic Church nor to be bound
to its tradition, I don't see what an accusation of heresy from that quarter
is worth. After all, you already (at least if you're consistent) believe him
to be a heretic for denying papal infallibilty and a host of other accumulated
dogmas. Why should he care that you ALSO think he's a heretic about this?  
  
One can't instead appeal to some ""mere orthodoxy"" common to all Christians
across confessional boundaries, at least not without stretching that ""mere"" to
meaninglessness. What church council requires us to believe in liberarian free
will? Which creed explains what it means for God to choose? If we go beyond
that, we're appealing to a vague consensus, not to orthodoxy.",905

"No, most certainly not. JPII, like his predecessors, acknowledges that God
**calls** all to holiness, and even _orders_ them toward holiness so that
holiness is their only true end. And by constituting the Church to be His
agent of grace on Earth, God ordains all to receive the truth and grace from
the treasures of the Church. (And all who receive sanctifying grace ARE in
fact members of that Church, even if they are not expressly aware of it.) Thus
the life of grace constitutes for EVERY man the wholeness and fullness of
life, a sharer in Jesus Christ _in fact_ after being, from the moment of first
conception, a sharer IN POTENTIA _by ordination toward_ that life, and by
Christ's great mission to make disciples of all nations.  
  
JPII expresses this most clearly in saying _as ""chosen"" by him from eternity
and called, destined for grace and glory..._ The chosing is from all eternity,
and is universal in the sense of all being _ordered toward_ the life of grace
and toward being sharers in Christ, being ""destined"" in the sense of being
both ordered and CALLED to it, but it unfolds in concrete time with the
actions by which one actually adheres to God in grace, and this can fail to
occur.",1206
"Hey @Talmid and @Michael  
  
Guys, thank you so much for the words. It really means a lot to me. I'm
usually alone and with few friends and when people say things to me like you
guys said it really means a lot to me - because I know the lack of that and
how it really warms our hearts when people care for us. So thank you, thank
you so much!  
  
@Michael, I saw the post that Ed made with an open thread and I will
participate! Today was the first day in weeks that I felt a little bit better.
I will try somehow engage in the arguments there, because like I said, I'm not
worried about materialism per se (even though the existence of atoms and etc.
sometimes puzzle me as to why God makes the world that way, you know? Why the
micro exists in a way that it 'seems' that things could be ""reduced"" to them)
because of the arguments Ed presented in the prolegomenon of the Scholastics
Meta (I only believed materialism in this XXI century sense because I was a
foolish boy born in a country that philosophy that is seriously engaging in
these points marginally exists - yeah continental philosophy sucks).  
  
My problem is the worse version of 'materialism' that is the buddhist (because
in practice, doesn't matter how they argue, the consequences are basically the
same but, surprisingly, worse). In these very difficult (to say the least) 3
years of my life. What really broke me from the inside (based on what I was
talking about Libet) is the fact that I (and the person that I love with my
life in this world, my mom, who's in fact the only family that I have in
practice) could indeed be a substance per accidens (to use the best
terminology) - because ALL of these ideologies like reductionism, materialism,
and especially buddhism will lead to that no matter how they try to persuade
or say otherwise. They will inevitably treat human beings as unreal and
aggregates or 'useful fictions' (sometimes I think that it was the devil
himself who plunges these ideologies into our mentality).  
  
If there is one thing in all these 3 years that I do not forget was the pain
(the mental pain and depression) that I felt and still feel. In my 24 years of
life, nothing EVER hit me like that. And I don't know how people simply
swallow materialism or even worse buddhism of these sorts - if they do really
love their own kind ones or have any moral principles about persons at all -
they should be rejecting it immediately. Because as I said what caused me all
that trauma that still scares me today is the possibility of those things (i.e
the fact that we are just an aggregate or unreal and live just to suffer).
It's simply devilish. Why would anyone want to live in a world like that? You
know.",2703
"Edmund Crispin wrote a humorous crime novel, Holy Disorders published in 1945.
Two clerics, soon to be suspected of murder, enter a room in earnest
discussion: “…But, my dear Spitshuker, you apparently fail to realise that by
taking the universalist view you are, in effect, denying the reality of man’s
freedom to choose between good and evil. If we are all to go to heaven anyway,
then that choice has no validity. It’s as if one were to say that a guest at a
tea-party has freedom to choose between muffins and crumpets when only
crumpets are provided.”

this, if you will forgive my saying so. You would concede, of course, that the
Divinity is a god of Love?”

Creation. You will agree that even in the case of the greatest saint,

we have at our disposal. I am inclined, therefore, to believe that there must
be an intermediate state, a purgatory—”",1147

For this scenario to not contradict Catholic teaching, it would entail that
every single person *freely* chose God. It could not be determined by any kind
of necessity. While this is possible philosophically, it contradicts the words
of Christ that few will find the narrow gate and many will follow the wide
path that leads to destruction. He of course knows what all will freely choose
and He has made clear in this passage what many in fact will choose. In light
of Christ's knowledge of these facts, the situation you describe is not just
exceedingly improbable. It is impossible. Please see what I write above about
the distinction between possible interpretations and eisogesis based on
foregone conclusions.",724

"@Michael @Talmid @AnonWCB  
  
That was incredible, you are amazing guys. Thank you so much for the in-depth
answers. That helped a lot.  
  
I asked that because of the time I've been passing through life in the last 3
years. My life has been a lot miserably. So it's nice to know that - even
though it's hard to imagine how in one act - God is listening to my prayers.
But I won't lose my faith.  
  
In case you guys were curious about that it has to do with things that
happened before I meet Ed's blog. My life - my family - life has always been
pretty harsh. And to worsen all that I have OCD. My grandmother on my father-
side died of Alzheimer and I'm afraid that my father would develop that too.
My mother lost her job due to an injustice that happened to her during the
pandemic and all that bullshit.  
  
But the worst thing that doesn't seem to go away is the depression and trauma
that my OCD contributed to. I was very very influenced by Libet's
''experiment'' back then and unfortunately, I acknowledge a fella named Sam
Harris with all that mysticism about 'no self' etc. (that seemed to follow
from the experiment's conclusion), and since then that stuck in my head - not
because I believed it - even though I had a weak spot for materialism and
'took it for granted' because you know ''science'' mentality that I was
influenced to. The problem was (somehow still) the fact that I didn't even
know how to defend myself from all that (i.e that the experiment methods were
bogus, that the rest doesn't necessarily follow from it). And the implication
with all of that in my life was the fact that if that is true, life is simply
worse than it seems. There is just pain and suffering. What weighed more than
one hundred pounds for me was the fact that I simply love my mom and my family
and if there was no free will, no God, and we were somehow unreal because
there was no self (nothing that lasts or abides)... I don't need to paint the
rest of the picture to see how evil, atrocious, and how I felt and still feel
because I have nightmares and traumas with that till nowadays.  
  
In the midway path between that, I found Ed's blog and began to read it - even
emailed him one time. And that gave me hope that there was a God after all and
that those things could be false.  
  
But even so, buddhist claims from Harris traumatized me a lot and due to my
OCD, I still suffer from them till today. Deep there, I confess I'm really
afraid that something evil like that is possibly true. Because it's an even
worse version of materialism with all its adorns.  
  
Based on what I've learned from Ed's books and posts I tried to read some
authors from that and engaged against it for some time (authors like Jay
Garfield and Mark Siderits)  
  
(I will continue)",2777
"Regarding your suggestion that it is up to me why I should hold a position
that is contrary to the state of our society and that this is ""up to me"": Well
this is true, but profoundly unhelpful for our discussion. It is ""up to you""
whether you believe in fairies and goblins. You are ""free"" to believe in
fairies and goblins, but that does not make such a belief rooted in Scripture
or Tradition. Nor does it make it reasonable. And choices that are rooted
neither in reason nor revelation are baseless. Such ""freedom"" is really no
freedom at all. It is a sheer willfulness to believe whatever I want to
believe regardless of reason, evidence, and revelation. That is the point.
Authentic freedom is always rooted in reason and/or revelation. In other
words, authentic freedom is always rooted in the truth. If I have neither
reason nor revelation to support my belief in fairies, then it is unreasonable
to do so. If you wish to believe in fairies because they give you warm fuzzy
feelings, you are ""free"" to do so, but that does not make your choice a good
choice. It makes it baseless just as your choice to believe that everyone may
be going to heaven is baseless.  
  
This leads to the biggest problem with the position: counterfactuals. As
Edward Feser has noted, it is part of the Tradition that rational beings are
in hell, namely Satan and His Angels. It is also clear from Scripture that the
way is narrow and few will find it. Now some passages of Scripture are
difficult to interpret and admit varying interpretations. However, if one's
""interpretation"" involves denying or ignoring the testimony of Scripture, then
this is not really an interpreation so much as a denial of the explicit
teaching of Sripture. So if Scripture teaches that the way to eternal life is
narrow and few will find it and I say it is broad and everyone will (or might
find), then I am denying revelation. Who will or will not be saved is not
something you or I could know apart from revelation. However, it is something
that God knows and He has revealed to us that ""few will find it"". It is more
than mental gymnastics to interpret this as ""everyone will find it"", it is a
denial of the words of Christ who is in a better position than you or I to
tell us whether the road is broad or narrow and whether few or many will find
it.",2318

worth noting that the Church has formally defined this teaching. The First

layman's perspective here. I enjoy both your and DBH's writings. I learn from
your perspectives. With that said, I can't help but think you and Fr. Rooney
(I did read his article) are being a bit obtuse here. Hart does not seem to be
arguing that there is some power outside of God which compels God, removing
God's free will, to create. Rather, his argument is that God's very *nature*
is such that creation naturally follows from just who God is - it is the
natural end result of God *being*. He who is Love, Good, etc. is, by virtue of
who he is, going to create. It seems as though you and Fr. Rooney are not
arguing against Hart's actual argument.",726
"Dr. Feser,  
  
This was my question, also. Given your response, I have to ask the following:
How does the *real* possibility of God opting not to create make any sense
given classical theism's core doctrines of divine immutability and simplicity?
It seems these most fundamental commitments logically entail the necessity—in
some sense—of creation.  
  
How exactly do you imagine a simple and unchanging God deciding between
creating or not creating? Did God flip a coin? Was God conflicted and then
experienced change such that the conflict was resolved? Did the possibility of
creation randomly occur in the mind of God, such that it might not have
occurred?",662
"I just reread your scenario and need to make another caveat. If you are
suggesting a scenario where all are given special grace at death that makes
possible their conversion before death: yes that is possible. If you are
suggesting that such grace is irresistible: no that is not possible as it is
heretical. This gets at the options laid out in Fr. Rooney's article noted
above.",379
"  
Right off the bat Fr. Rooney’s summary is just awful. Hart has never argued
that it’s impossible to hell. He clearly affirms in various interviews
following the publication of TASBS that it’s possible, indeed likely, that
many will go to hell but that they will not remain there eternally. His view
makes the fires of hell purgative rather than retributive. Catholic thinkers
have to be able to take Hart’s arguments on their own terms rather than trying
to square them with foreign pictures of judgement (such as: immediate judgment
upon death whereupon one is sent to everlasting joy in heaven or everlasting
pain in hell). At this point it’s just sad how many putatively intelligent
Catholics cannot even summarize, let alone respond to Hart’s arguments. Even
conservative theologians like Larry Chapp recognize this (and his recent
interview with Hart is worth watching).  
  
Propping up willful misreadings of Hart’s argument is really not doing
anything good for your brand, Doc. Better luck next time",1011
"WCB, I've emailed with Seventh-day Adventists who believe that a soul is a
complete human person with a material body. So they quote Genesis in the KJV
because it says Adam became a living soul when God breathed into Adam's nose.  
  
But other Protestant Bibles say ""living being"" instead. That alternative
phrase suggests that God's breath represents Adam's soul. If it does, it's
easy to see that interpretation of the passage supports the Catholic doctrine
that a new human person begins when a human sperm fertilizes a human ovum. It
also explains why the Catholic Church teaches that deliberate abortion is
always murder.  
  
The Adventist idea that a human soul is a complete human person makes it hard
to know why Our Lord says, ""My soul is sorrowful, even unto death."" Since he
has a human nature, he has a human body and a human soul. But if he talked as
though he was only a body-soul composite, that would hint that he was only
human.",947
"I’m really not so sure that’s the case. There are legions of online Christians
- Catholic orthodox, and protestant alike - wrestling with this issue in
comboxes all over the Web and I cannot tell you how many people honestly

do in this life ultimately doesn’t matter. God will love you and save you and
have mercy on you and there’s nothing to fear in the afterlife (so don’t worry
about evangelizing, either!)”.  
  
I totally get that you, Dr. phaser, understand hearts position. But Fr.

hell”, which is absolutely not what Hart argues. Unless I’m missing something,
that’s just a straight-up willful misreading of the text.",776

Orthodox Christians, (as well as Catholics), usually place great reliance on
the teachings of the Fathers, especially they revere the early Fathers and the
Greek Fathers, and they rely on the early Councils. A plausible case of
departure from _orthodoxy_ on that basis can be made - by Catholics - against
someone who (at least used to) comport himself as an Orthodox Christian.
Rooney cites (a) an essay on the Eastern Patristic tradition on God's freedom,
and eastern saints John Damascene, and Isaac of Nineveh. Maybe his argument
isn't a great one - I have reservations about a couple points, myself - but
it's not **irrelevant** to the orthodoxy of an Orthodox Christian.",855
"I have read Hart's ""That All Shall Be Saved"" and as far as I remember nothing
in his argument required necessitarianism of any kind.  
  
Yes, he did argue that it is IMPOSSIBLE for human beings to be damned. And
yes, in a way he did argue that it was IMPOSSIBLE for God not to save all the
people he had made, given God's moral perfection. But again, both of these
propositions are fully compatible with God deciding to not create anything at
all, or deciding to create a universe with no people. The only thing that
follows from the impossibility of eternal damnation is the impossibility of
eternal damnation, not that God absolutely had to create our universe and save
everyone, or even had to create (and save) any people.  
  
Whether Hart actually defends necessitarianism in other works might very well
be possible. But it is completely irrelevant for universalism as well as his
specific argument.  
  
Fr. Rooney says ""If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something
makes it so..."" but again, when universalists say that it is necessary that
God will save everyone, they are speaking of a conditional necessity, I.e.
GIVEN that God has created people, it is impossible that he would then fail to
save all of them. The universalist is not saying that it is necessary for God
to CREATE any world or a specific world and then save everyone; he is just
saying it is impossible for God to create people and then have them be lost
forever to eternal damnation or annihilation.

can't have any passive potency (He can't be thinking all the time 'oh, look at
the world I made', or waiting for someone to procreate and then boom soul
created because that would involve change, I think.).

Even assuming universalism requires 1, the ""could not do otherwise"" clause is
a conditional one. That is to say, *if* God creates humans, God cannot do
otherwise than cause human beings to love him. This is consistent with there
being a possible world in which God does NOT create anything, or creates a
universe with no human beings in it. It is only inconsistent with God creating
a world with humans and then having said humans not love him/be damned in the
end. From the impossibility of people being lost forever, universalists are
not arguing that it's impossible that people never have existed in the first
place. It should be obvious that it is a conditional on the creation of people
- to put it differently, from infernalism and annihilationism being impossible
it does not follow that universalism is necessary simpliciter, such that God
could not have chosen to not make a universe with humans being all saved.

the Anonymous who posted at 4:44 pm, so: call me ""Forty-four"".  
  
2\. Also for clarity's sake, I DO NOT believe that Hell is empty, and I do
accept the weight of Tradition.  
  
However, so far as I am aware (and this is of course limited - I have not read
most of the Fathers & Doctors), there is no specific biblical passage that
tells us in certain and definitive terms that THERE ARE some in Hell. It is,
therefore, (so far as I know), remotely, vaguely possible to suggest that the
biblical passages that point toward Hell are all to be understood as
contingent: e.g. contingent on the sinner(s) not repenting.  
  
_More than this, the scenario is *not possible* given the fact that Christ has
revealed to us than many will in fact follow the path to destruction._  
  
For all those huge numbers on the road to destruction, they will REACH
destruction...if they do not repent. Suppose that **every single** person on
Earth (other than Christ and Mary) will be on that road at some point in their
lives, and so that road is very, very wide, and heavily populated. But we also
know that SOME who are on that road turn around and head the other way - they
repent.  
  
Therefore, not everyone who is on the road to destruction _reaches_
destruction. What if 90% who are on the road right now, repent: the heavy
population of the road right now tells us nothing about the ratio of those who
end up in hell. What if it's 99%? What if it's 100% who repent?  
  
Christ will, at the end of time, judge all people. Those who are judged to be
goats will go off to final perdition. What if the class of ""the goats"" happens
to have no members - an empty set? The _class_ is still a valid concept,
because of the contingent possibility that some might not have repented.  
  
I repeat: I don't think this what the weight of Tradition is pointing toward.
I think that Christ **repeatedly** pointed out the dangers of Hell because
there ARE people going to Hell. But I also recognize a difference between
""that's the best sense of the passages"" and ""that's definitively what the
passages mean without any quibble or room for any other sense.""",2215

"For example, many divine actions are described in scripture in a manner that
implies that God would not have taken them had certain contingent conditions
been different, such as his punishment of sinners at the time of Noah and at
Sodom and Gomorrah. Of course, that does not entail that God really went
through some reasoning process, as we do, before acting. The point is that the
clear implication of these texts is that people could have acted other than
the way they did, and that had they done so, _God_ would have done something
other than what he actually did.",568
"Tadeo,  
  
This is a great question that has been considered by great theologians like
St. Augustine. The answer lies partly in God's relationship to time. God does
not learn things that occur in history. He sees them all in one glance because
he is outside time. He is not bound by it, but he is the cause of the
existence of all that is bound by time. So in one glance He sees all things
and He sees all things in relation to Himself. This pertains to Aristotle's
thought thinking self. God knows all things as being caused by Himself. He
sees in Himself the cause of all things and sees all things as caused by Him.
This entails that all things (such as our prayers) can only be known in the
full sense with reference to God who is the cause of our existence while
praying and the cause of the very beings about which are prayers are concerned
(e.g. our children or parents or friends, etc). This pertains also to His Will
because, in seeing all things at once, He does not will things in acts that
are temporally distinguished. In the unity of the Divine Will flowing out of
the unity of Divine knowledge of all things created, all created things are
willed by Him. This unity of the Divine will in the act of creation is an act
of Divine Goodness. It is a sharing of HIs goodness with the created order.
This is a Trinitarian act because Christ is the Word of God through whom He
speaks the world into existence and the Spirit is the love of the Divine Will
by which He wills the world from His Goodness. I would like to add more, but
cannot due to time, but perhaps later I can do so.",1591

freedom. That is to say, he claims that God’s being free is compatible with
his being unable not to create the world. Now, as Rooney says, this

unable positively to will _evil_ , specifically, and that the ability to do so
would indeed be a defect in his freedom. But it also insists that he was
nevertheless able not to create this particular world, or indeed any world at
all. For Christian orthodoxy, the claim is not (contra Hart) merely that the
world could have failed to exist.  It is that God could have refrained from
bringing it into being. It is a claim not merely about the nature of the

orthodox Christian tradition, and claim that his own views are more consistent
with it than those of his opponents. But in other cases, he will dismiss the
standard criteria of Christian orthodoxy and appeal instead to merits that his
views purportedly exhibit independently of questions of orthodoxy. As I there
argued, Hart’s approach isn’t, at the end of the day, that of a Christian

proponents such as Dr Feser deliberately choose to link Catholic thought as
synonymous to the wholesale debasement of CRT going forward, my work is easy.
I have no need to effect anything that isn't already the ineluctable result of
the shrivelling of catholic thought. The seeds of its own destruction are
deeply embedded within its own character.  
It is egregiously misplaced for Dr Feser to argue from a perspective that is
entirely unfounded. CRT does not, I repeat, does not teach that any race is
inherently racist or superior, but it does teach how race is deeply ingrained
in our history. The dozen or so States that have legislated against the
'teaching of CRT' in schools, banning books and curricular material across the
country is the stuff of authoritarianism, not of democracies. It is nothing
less than a cynical and forlorn attempt not only at erasing a somewhat sorry
chapter in human relations but equally, the wholesale whitewashing of American
history.

I won’t say there is no such theory. There is. Actually, though, versions of
the theory are held both on the farthest, farthest fringes of the right and –
more quietly – among large, large sections of the left.  
  
The right wing version is that immigrants, especially immigrants of color,
outbreed people who were born in the country, so that descendants of the
former will “replace” descendants of the latter. This is supposed to be bad.  
  
The left wing version is that immigrants, especially immigrants of color,
trend more to the left than people who were born in the country, so that
leftists will “replace” conservatives. This is supposed to be good.  
  
Both versions of the theory are nuts.  
  
As to the former version: If the country becomes browner in a few generations,
so be it. People who are too selfish to have children deserve to be “replaced”
by people who love them.  
  
As to the latter version: Immigrants who are acquainted with the politics of
the country are often quite conservative; they don’t want to lose what they’ve
worked and suffered to attain. So if left-wingers think immigration will lead
to the “replacement” of conservatives by liberals, they may have it
backwards.""

""Critical"" in the very name but that tradition?  
  
From the Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's page on ""Critical Theory"":  
  
""According to these theorists, a 'critical' theory may be distinguished from a
'traditional' theory according to a specific practical purpose: a theory is
critical to the extent that it seeks human 'emancipation from slavery', acts
as a 'liberating … influence', and works 'to create a world which satisfies
the needs and powers of' human beings (Horkheimer 1972b [1992, 246]). Because
such theories aim to explain and transform all the circumstances that enslave
human beings, many 'critical theories in the broader sense have been
developed. They have emerged in connection with the many social movements that
identify varied dimensions of the domination of human beings in modern
societies.  
  
...While Critical Theory is often thought of narrowly as referring to the
Frankfurt School that begins with Horkheimer and Adorno and stretches to
Marcuse and Habermas, any philosophical approach with similar practical aims
could be called a 'critical theory,' including feminism, critical race theory,
and some forms of post-colonial criticism."" (Bohman, 2021, paras. 1-2)

Marxim has nothing to do with noting the history of racism in America in the
academic setting of CRT. And that handwave arguments that do not demonstrate

Then there is another issue. If this was a Marxist enterprise to understand

have chronically failed to take the problems of America's systemic racism
seriously over the last few decades. One wishes Professor Feser would deal

As far as I have read what is banned in schools is only the teaching of
nonsensical notions of whiteness or micro aggressions, it does not ban the
teaching of facts that there are racists or white supremacists. But it does
bar making white students apologise to black students for transgressions of
the past or teaching that the white people of today have innate racism of
which they don't know about. This is literally what is being taught in
schools, muti national corporations etc. And it's not just white people, any
group that has a had any measure of success in the system namely Asians, has
been accused of pandering to the so called White Supremacists. If people are
banning CRT at the college level is wrong but at the school level, there is
really no need to teach children that America's social and economic structures
are supposedly inherently designed to prevent the success of minorities. There
may be particular people in the system who are acting in a racist way, that's
not s failure of the system, rather it's a failure of the people to abide by
the system. People are flawed and every once in a while you can encounter a
racist jerk but it's inevitable, there's a limit to which you can fine tune

"I think you are ignoring the elephant in the room though. The fact that a
council condemned Honorius proves that Catholics, including the Pope, held
that a Pope can be guilty of teaching heresy outside of infallibility. It is
very easy to establish by looking at the history of the Church that such a
belief was never rejected as an error. We see this in the case of how the
Church viewed cases like Pope John XXII as well. In fact, considering that
even some of the saints you mentioned do not say that such a thing is
impossible, it only confirms the matter. As for why they attempted to defend
Honorius, that would just be piety at work.",640
"Second, as noted by John Chapman (whose book on Honorius I discussed in my
previous post), the Church has long held that “an error which is not resisted
is approved; a truth which is not defended is suppressed” (in the words of
Honorius’s predecessor Pope Felix III). It is possible to be guilty of
teaching doctrinal error by implication, when the context demands that a
certain truth needs to be explicitly affirmed and instead one not only fails
to do so but speaks in an ambiguous way that gives the appearance of approving
the error. And that is exactly what Honorius did. The Monothelite error was
being put forward, and he not only did not clearly condemn it but _seemed_ to
be saying that it could be accepted. The suggestion that his words can be
given a more charitable reading (as I agree they can) is relevant to his
personal culpability, but it is not relevant to the question of the doctrinal
soundness of the words themselves, and as Chapman emphasizes, in a context
like this it is the words that matter.",1020

argument that 1) Yes it was an act of the Magisterium, even from the Pope
himself, thus 2) Therefore the Magisterium is not protected even from heresy
in its ordinary teachings.  
  
This strikes me as unworkable. One resolution - one Dr. Feser seems to agree
with - is that it was not heresy in the sense Vatican I defined heresy. I
think it is also notable that the Pope did not consult the bishops or address
the Church, so I'm not sure if Vatican I was referring to a Pope's private
letters when it talks about the teaching office of the Church.",780
"Wright is also selective in the way he cites the relevant authorities. For
example, while he acknowledges that Chapman is on the side of those who judge
Honorius to be guilty of teaching error, he makes Chapman’s position sound
more tentative than it really is.  Wright claims, for example: “Chapman is the
most hostile critic, and yet all that he can bring himself to say is that
certain passages are ‘difficult to account for.’” As we’ve just seen, though,
that is far from the truth. Again, in his book Chapman goes so far as to say
that “unquestionably no Catholic has the right to deny that Honorius was a
heretic”; and in his _Catholic Encyclopedia_ article on Honorius, he says that
“it is clear that no Catholic has the right to defend Pope Honorius.  He was a
heretic, not in intention, but in fact.” Oddly, Wright does not quote these
(rather important) remarks when reporting on Chapman’s views.",906

not convinced these letters by Honorius are acts of the Magisterium. You make
the case here:  
  
_But it is not true to say (as some have in Honorius’s defense) that he was
merely speaking as a private theologian. He was doing no such thing. Sergius
wrote to him seeking the authoritative advice of the bishop of Rome, and
Honorius responded in that capacity._  
  
Okay, let's look at it like this. When Pope Francis is being asked for quotes
about theological matters, they are not interviewing him because he's a
regular guy. They are interviewing him because he's the Pope. The only reason
they are about his opinion is that he is the Pope. When he gives his response,
it is as the Pope, sometimes on a subject of faith and morals. Is this an

Once we understand and apply the difference between certainty and

Newman's fallibility, or the fallibility of any other private individual (such

is using their supposed infallibility as the premise in an argument for papal
infallibility, or for anything else. No one is saying, 'I am infallible, so

Anyone can come to a valid rational certainty of a particular truth (whether
absolute certainty or reasonable moral certainty, as the case may be) based on
strong enough evidence before them in the particular case, even without a

actualised in that instance. (Otherwise, no one could ever be certain of

"How is it possible to be an consecrated a bishop and then teach but not teach
under the auspices of your being a bishop, i.e. ""teacher""? If you are made a

But the _bindingness_ of bishops' teachings varies in degree, according to the
manner in which they propose them to us ""to be held"". Some they assert with
great force and definitude, with explicit reference to this being something
taught by the Church from time immemorial. Others they teach less definitely,
but still ""with authority"". Others again they teach very mildly, but still as
something they want us to accept. These are all _teachings_ and therefore they
must be received by us, _in accord with the MANNER in which they were proposed
to be received._ There are infinitely many degrees in which their teachings
require assent from us, as is the infinitely many degrees of the teachings
being taught with an expectation of being received.  
  
It is when a bishop, either by venue, by context, or by clear mention,
indicates that he is merely speculating or indulging in pious but uncertain
considerations, that he is not asking for our assent as such. When he says
things like ""well, _it seems to me_ "", or ""in my personal opinion,"" or ""I feel
that X, but others may feel differently"" he is indicating room for dissent by
others.  
  
But note also that the venue is not WHOLLY determinative: in an encyclical, a
pope might state a new idea that is his own personal view but is still
uncertain, and also re-state a time-honored and universally approved teaching.
The fact that the venue is _capable_ of teaching high and _strongly_
authoritative statements (and is the normal venue for doing so) does not mean
every word in the encyclical bears that degree. Just as not every word of an
ecumenical council consists in an infallible dogmatic decree, even though a

There is nothing about your objection that logically limits its application to
matters of religion - if it were valid, it would remove the possibility of
objective certainty in any field of knowledge, since any assertion we made
would always require the implicit qualification, 'But since I am fallible, I
could be wrong about this' (even about e.g. 2+2=4).  
  
I'll mention in passing - the objection, thus taken to its logical conclusion,
would therefore appear to be self-refuting, because the objector puts forward
the objection itself as objectively certain truth (not qualifying it as
'merely probable').  
  
But be that as it may, I will try to show that (whether or not its conclusion
is self-refuting) the objection is a logical fallacy.  
  
This is its basic structure:  
  
It is possible for beliefs of mine to be false.  
X is a belief of mine.  
Therefore it is possible that X is false.  
  
Consider the parallel argument:  
  
It is possible for cats to be black.  
Fluffy is a cat.  
Therefore it is possible that Fluffy is black [even though I can see she is
white].  
  
The reason that these arguments fail is that I can be aware of more about
Fluffy than the fact that she is a cat, and I can be aware of more about 'X'
than the fact that it is a belief of mine. If all we knew about Fluffy was
that she was a cat, then it would be reasonable to say that it was possible
that she was black. And if all we knew about X was that it was a belief of my
fallible self, then it would be reasonable to say that X was possibly false.  
  
But in fact, I can know from the evidence of my senses that in Fluffy's case,
the abstract possibility for cats to be black is not fulfilled in her
particular case. And I can know from direct knowledge of conclusive logical or
factual evidence in the particular case of X (e.g. 2+2=4), that the abstract
general possibility of my beliefs being false is not fulfilled in the
particular case of my belief X.  
  
This is why the general fallibility that is ours as humans does not prove the
impossibility of individuals reaching valid objective certainty in particular
cases, where the individual is aware of sufficient evidence for the belief.  
  
So there is no reason in principle why an individual, although fallible, might
not discover sufficient evidence to ground a valid objective certainty
(absolute certainty or reasonable moral certainty as the case may be) that
e.g. '2+2=4', or 'The theory of relativity is true', or 'God has promised to
protect from error a whole class of statements made by the pope in certain
fairly well-defined circumstances'. One would need to examine the purported
evidence in each case, but there is no reason in principle that it could not
exist, despite our fallibility.

In Benedict XVI's Foreword to his book 'Jesus of Nazareth' published during
his pontificate, he wrote, 'It goes without saying that this book is in no way
an exercise of the magisterium, but is solely an expression of my personal
search for the face of the Lord. Everyone is free, then, to contradict me. I
would only ask my readers for that initial goodwill without which there can be
no understanding.' (It was understood by everyone as being written in his
capacity 'as a private theologian'.)  
  
The book had a certain impact around the world of Catholic thought, as he no
doubt wished - partly caused by his pre-existing reputation as a theologian,
but certainly added to by the simple fact that he was now pope. He wanted to
'teach' people, in a similar way to us wanting to 'teach' each other by
posting on this blog - hopefully our motive is that we want to help one
another on the path to truth. And he wanted to use his new platform as pope to
reach a wider audience.  
  
However, Benedict didn't want Catholics to consider themselves morally bound
to accept what he said, just from the mere fact of who it was that said it. I
don't think that this was particularly because he was tentative or uncertain
about his statements in the book - maybe for some of them he was, others he
wasn't. But rather, he wanted in this case to leave acceptance of what he was
saying simply up to the free consideration of the individual. He didn't wish
to 'bind' anyone.  
  
So, he took off his 'pope' cap and put on his 'private theologian' cap, saying
that his writing was solely an expression of his 'personal search for the face
of the Lord' (despite presumably being motivated by wanting others to learn
from his words and to be influenced by them).  
  
Is that swapping of caps problematic on your view? I'm reading you (maybe) as
saying or implying that the assertions of a pope in faith or morals cannot
fail to be 'binding' on any Catholic to some extent, whether the pope likes it
or not; or maybe that this is so, at least by default. That is (maybe unless
the pope explicitly says otherwise, as with Benedict's book), Catholics should
consider themselves morally bound to adhere (at least to some degree) to a
pope's assertions in faith or morals, merely from the fact of who it is that
is asserting them. This would be whether or not they are published in an
official document, and whether or not they are promulgated to the whole
Church: it is all 'teaching', and by a representative of Christ, and therefore
magisterial.  
  
So on this view, the official but private replies of Pope Honorius to
Patriarch Sergius would be 'binding' to some extent on any Catholic who learnt
of them and their contents.  
  
And the plane interviews of Pope Francis would be to some small degree
magisterial (if they concern faith or morals) - calling for our acceptance of
his statements from the mere fact of who it is that is speaking and
'teaching'.

the subjective feeling of certainty and the objective possession of certainty.

" _If you limit infallibility to ex cathedra statements, that's limited
infallibility, which is another way of saying fallibility._  
  
This is nonsensical. Nobody else on planet earth - outside of the bishops
speaking in union to teach the faithful on a matter of faith and morals - can
EVER be infallible in any circumstance. That is a very clear, major, and
obvious difference between regular people and the Pope.",416
"Even if this is true, it is hardly a decisive argument, given that (as Aquinas
famously pointed out) the argument from authority, while not without value, is
still the weakest of arguments when the authorities in question are merely
human rather than divine. And they _are_ merely human, given that this is at
best a matter about which the Church has not decided, and leaves open to the
free debate of theologians. Indeed, as I have argued, it is actually worse
than that for Honorius’s defenders, given that two papally-approved councils
(which teach infallibly and thus _do_ have divine authority behind them)
taught that Honorius was guilty of teaching error.",662
"Bellomy here  
  
You may be agreeing with me. Bishops individually can teach heresy; the
college of bishopss can teach error but not heresy.

something that bibds believers to religious assent of mind and will.  ",288

whether he intends the recipient to receiving this and be guided by it._  
  
It is certainly very relevant when discussing if anybody should be bound to
this teaching or whether he is writing a simple advice letter.",294
"Needless to say, what Honorius actually said in his letters to Sergius is
relevant to this question. But it is not the only thing that is relevant. The
chief obstacle to acquitting Honorius of the charge of positively teaching
doctrinal error (however inadvertently) is that, as I showed in my previous
article, _two papally-approved councils of the Church explicitly said that he
did_. In particular, the Sixth Ecumenical Council explicitly labeled him a
“heretic.” And the Seventh Ecumenical Council explicitly condemns “ **the
doctrine of one will held by** Sergius, **Honorius** , Cyrus, and Pyrrhus.”",605

"Second, the reason most of Honorius’s defenders try to defend him is to avoid
having to acknowledge that a pope can teach heresy when not speaking _ex
cathedra_. Now, suppose that the councils did indeed get it wrong when judging
that Honorius, specifically, was a heretic. Since that is a historical rather
than doctrinal matter, such an error is possible. Still, by making this
judgment, the councils also taught by implication that _it is possible for a
pope to teach heresy_ (when not speaking _ex cathedra_ ). And _that is_ a
doctrinal matter. That is enough to refute the larger claim that Honorius’s
defenders are trying to uphold by defending him.",655

Problem is this: magisteroum is not doctinal, is a giuridic act like the
infallible council of Costantinople 3. It also can speak on liturgy and praxis
( like the second Nicea council ) or the spiritual mystical way.  
You speak about magisterioum like it has the power to esthabilish teorical

"Well, I don't know that I can convince you, but:  
The ""authority to teach"" has always been connected to Christ's ""he who hears
you hears Me."" And the latter has always been part of the basis for the
position that the magisterial office is protected from error, though not
protected _in every sense._ It is pretty odd to think of Christ conveying (to
bishops) an authority to teach _in his name,_ but NOT do anything about
protecting said teachings of those teachers, just the teachings of the pope.
And when the bishops, in their **ordinary** teachings, teach a truth that is
also universally taught by the other bishops, **that** teaching is not only
protected _somewhat_ (i.e. like the kind of protection over those teachings to
which we owe religious submission), those teachings are infallible and we owe
them unreserved assent. So, the bishops in exercising their _ordinary_
teaching office can at least touch on the higher protection, which _suggests_
that they also can touch on the lower protection afforded those teachings to
which we owe religious assent - also in their ordinary exercise of their
teaching office. That is, both acts are acts of their ordinary teaching
office, the difference in the kind of submission we owe being EXTERNAL to the
teaching act itself: it is implausible that we would come to owe UNRESERVED
assent to a teaching of our bishop once we realize that it has universal
agreement of the other bishops, but that _before_ we completed that discovery
that we owed it not even the smallest smidgen of religious submission even
when we have discovered wide agreement of many bishops (but have not yet
established a universal agreement).",1669
"Implying that a Pope can teach heresy when not speaking ex cathedra - simply
because Vatican I defined that ex cathedra statements cannot be heretical -
seems a classic logical flaw of making the conclusion broader than the
premises.  
  
The Seventh Oecumenical Council could not evaluate the writings of Pope
Honorius as heretical, not only because they weren’t, but because there was no
discussion of these writings. If it accepted the history that Honorius was a
heretic, it got it wrong.  
  
Vatican I, which left nothing to implication, explained how we ought to
interpret its deliberations. Because it defined that all the Popes had
“unfailing faith”, the expressions contained in the deliberations of the
Seventh Oecumenical Council should be understood as the censure of the
extremely negligent behaviour that it was; the term heretic was not as
specific then as it later would be. The sense of Vatican I in defining Papal
infallibility is obvious; it is prefaced with Christ’s prayer that Peter’s
faith would not fail, not merely that he might speak infallibly one a century.
Rather than put a strict modern theological understanding of the term heresy
into the mouths of prelates in ancient times, we need to apply the modern
Church understanding of the Papacy; there is no getting around this.  
  
Whether or not one can be accused of being a heretic for “not resisting an
error” and “not defending the truth, one is NOT a heretic because of those
things; Pope Felix III, cited in the post, has just explained how to view
quite possible uses (which do not convey the understanding of a heretical Pope
as we discuss it) of the term heretic in his times!  
  
The bottom line is that, even if “the Pope cannot be heretical when not
speaking ex cathedra” were reduced to an opinion that is not probable, this
would not translate into meaning the contrary opinion is probable. Such a view
still needs to be substantiated, something very far from view.  ",1963

"You've missed the point. All statements about infallibility are made by
fallible humans. There is no way to escape human fallibility. Therefore
infallibility is never established. As you yourself have admitted: you are
fallible. Therefore how can you belief in infallibility be certainly true?",293
"Let’s note also at the outset that the issue here is _not_ whether Catholics
are ordinarily obligated to assent to papal teaching even when it is not put
forward infallibly. The answer is that they _are_ ordinarily obligated. More
precisely, they owe even non-definitive papal teaching what is called
“religious assent,” which is not the unqualified assent owed to teaching put
forward infallibly, but is nevertheless firm. To be even more precise, there
is a very strong _presumption_ in favor of such assent, though the Church, in
documents like _Donum Veritatis_ , has acknowledged that there can be rare
cases in which this presumption is overridden and a faithful Catholic at
liberty respectfully to raise questions about some magisterial statement. The
clearest sort of case would be one where a magisterial statement appears to
conflict with past definitive teaching. I’ve discussed this issue in detail
[elsewhere](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2018/05/the-church-permits-
criticism-of-popes_20.html).",1012
"In support of your point, can we say that one essential factor differentiating
magisterial and non-magisterial acts is the manifested will of a bishop to
bind to obedience the faithful under his authority to adhere (at least in some
degree) to a particular teaching?  
  
Vatican II said of the Ordinary Magisterium, 'In matters of faith and morals,
the bishops speak in the name of Christ and the faithful are to accept their
teaching and adhere to it with a religious assent. This religious submission
of mind and will must be shown in a special way to the authentic magisterium
of the Roman Pontiff, even when he is not speaking ex cathedra; that is, it
must be shown in such a way that his supreme magisterium is acknowledged with
reverence, the judgments made by him are sincerely adhered to, according to
his manifest mind and will. His mind and will in the matter may be known
either from the character of the documents, from his frequent repetition of
the same doctrine, or from his manner of speaking.' (Lumen Gentium 25)  
  
As with Vatican I's dogma of papal infallibility, I would think that this is
intended by Vatican II as a description to be also applied retrospectively,
even if in the 7th century they were not yet thinking about it in these
explicit terms.  
  
The 'manifest mind' of a pope refers especially to the doctrinal content of a
document; his 'manifest will' refers especially to his intention to teach and
bind the faithful of the world. Normally he will not express this intention in
so many words, but it can be known 'either from the character of the
documents, from his frequent repetition of the same doctrine, or from his
manner of speaking.'  
  
But as a minimum, the intention to somehow bind the faithful of the world
would require the intention to promulgate the teaching to the faithful of the
world (not just sending a letter to one individual, leaving it to his choice
and initiative to promulgate to the world as he saw fit).  
  
The Holy See these days generally publishes a papal teaching document
(including letters to individuals or groups) in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis if
the pope's intention had been to promulgate that document to all the faithful
- thus confirming that it has at least some level of magisterial authority.  
  
Was it the intention of Pope Honorius that his letters to Patriarch Sergius be
promulgated to the Catholic world as binding (albeit non-definitive) teaching?
It does not appear so, and the condemnations of Honorius by the Ecumenical
Councils do not require us to think this either.  
  
Just as his letters do not fall within Vatican I's description of the papal
Extraordinary Magisterium, neither, apparently, do they fall within Vatican
II's description of the papal Ordinary Magisterium. And therefore, neither do
they provide a precedent showing that a teaching of the papal Ordinary
Magisterium can be not merely in error, but heretical.",2927
"First, the reason a council condemns someone as a heretic is because of his
_teaching_. Hence it is, first and foremost, Honorius’s _teaching_ that was
condemned. That means that the _teaching_ was judged heretical. But whether a
_teaching_ is heretical _is_ a doctrinal matter, and not a mere historical
matter. Now, given that a papally-approved council cannot err on doctrinal
matters, it follows that the councils in question infallibly judged that
Honorius’s teaching was heretical (whatever his intentions). But since anyone
who teaches heresy is a heretic, it follows (at least given that Honorius
really did write the letters that got him into trouble, as most of his
defenders concede) that these councils _did_ after all infallibly judge that
Honorius was a heretic.",776
"Wrong question.  
Right one: can any pope be defended? Sure. They only do and say what they are
supposed to do and say, based on interests, preferences and motives---  
some of which change, with changes in interests, preferences and motives...",244
"My recent article on [the error and condemnation of Pope
Honorius](http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2022/10/the-error-and-condemnation-
of-pope.html) has gotten a lot of feedback both here and at Twitter (much of
the latter surprisingly civil and constructive for that venue). Because of the
historical and theological complexities of the topic, several issues have
arisen, but the main one I want to address here is the question of whether
Honorius can plausibly be defended from the charge of heresy that the Sixth
Ecumenical Council leveled against him. Keep in mind that what is at issue
here is _not_ whether Honorius taught heresy while issuing a purported _ex
cathedra_ definition. He was certainly not doing that, which is why the case
of Honorius is irrelevant to whether popes are infallible when they _do_ teach
_ex cathedra_ (which is all that the First Vatican Council taught in its
decree on papal infallibility). What is at issue is whether Honorius taught
heresy when _not_ speaking _ex cathedra_ – and, more generally, whether any
pope could in principle do so.",1077
"First, what matters is that _Leo confirmed the council_ , thereby making its
decrees authoritative. He didn’t say “I confirm it, _except for_ this part.”
It’s true that in his own accompanying condemnation, he limits his accusation
against Honorius to negligence in suppressing heresy and thereby polluting the
purity of the Roman See, and does not apply the label “heretic” to him. But
Leo doesn’t deny the truth of the council’s statement that Honorius was a
heretic. He just doesn’t mention it (just as he doesn’t mention other things
the council said).",556
"I feel that the key point is the fact, as you mentioned, that even if one
succeeds in defending Honorius, it still remains true that the Church has
always believed it possible that a Pope can err when acting outside of the
boundaries of infallibility. So anyone who wishes to defend Honorius, which
usually tends to be the Sedevecantist or Ultramontanist types, can never
accomplish their goal. If they were to deny that the Church held the teaching,
then they must concede that Popes who tacitly implied/promoted and approved of
the belief that a Pope might err, had actually erred. Thus, their position is
undermined and cannot ever be salvaged.",647
"Newman's fallibility, or the fallibility of any other private individual (such
as you or me or the other posters on this site), is irrelevant, since no one
is using their supposed infallibility as the premise in an argument for papal
infallibility, or for anything else.  
  
They're not explicitly stating that, but it's implicit in the doctrine of
infallibility. That's why theologians distinguish between active infallibility
and passive infallibility. The Pope is actively infallible in proclaiming a
doctrine and we are passively infallible in accepting it and asserting it
ourselves.  
  
""So our fallibility has no logical bearing...""  
  
I think it does. Do you not agree that Orthodox, Muslims et al have succumbed
to fallibility in denying Papal infallibility and claiming an infallibility of
their own? Obviously you do. My problem is that I don't see how you've escaped
the fallibility that you yourself fully accept applies to others. And it's
obvious that if you or I had been born, say, Orthodox or Muslim in an Orthodox
or Muslim culture, then we would be much more likely to embrace the Muslim or
Orthodox version of infallibility than the Catholic. This doesn't happen in
math or physics.",1207
"This is why Chapman drew the bold conclusion that “unquestionably no Catholic
has the right to deny that Honorius was a heretic… a heretic in words if not
in intention” (p. 116). Quibbles over how to interpret his letters are largely
a red herring. What matters more is the authority of papally-approved councils
of the Church.",327
" _So you're not infallible when you claim that the Magisterium and Pope are
infallible?_  
  
You lost me here. Of course I am not. Yes, it is true that eventually
fallibility is introduced into the equation. The difference is that *IF* my
claim is right there is then a point when infallibility is introduced, which
is never the case normally.",344
"St. Alphonsus concludes that the only plausible defense of Honorius is to
argue that he was not himself a Monothelite heretic, while nevertheless
conceding that he was justly condemned “as a favourer of heretics, and for his
negligence in repressing error” and for “using ambiguous words to please and
keep on terms with heretics” (p. 187). That is very close to Chapman’s view
that Honorius can justly be accused of heresy given Felix III’s dictum that
“an error which is not resisted is approved; a truth which is not defended is
suppressed” – even if St. Alphonsus himself stops short of that conclusion.",607

"""You lost me here. Of course I am not.""

statements about infallibility are not certainly true. Therefore infallibility

""Yes, it is true that eventually fallibility is introduced into the equation.""  
  
Infallibility has to be there from the beginning or it can never be there. I
think you need to study the concept of passive infallibility. As things are,
you've shown once again that claims of infallibility are always and only made
by fallible humans. Some of whom are more fallible than others.  ",608
"All of this shows how utterly pointless the doctrine of papal infallibility
is. Infallible means unable to err. Fallible means able to err. When you say
that the Pope is most of the time able to err, you have asserted that the Pope
is fallible. If you limit infallibility to ex cathedra statements, that's
limited infallibility, which is another way of saying fallibility. To put it
another way, the Pope is infallible except when he isn't - and we can't even
agree on when he is and isn't. Yet the Pope is infallible. The whole doctrine
and its defense appears to have been invented by Lewis Carroll or L. Ron
Hubbard.",619

"(As a side note, and while we’re on the subject of arguments from authority,
let me cite one further authority mentioned by Chapman, St. Maximus the
Confessor. Now, Maximus, to be sure, defended Honorius. However, as Chapman
reports, when Monothelite heretics asked Maximus what he would do _if_ Rome
were to affirm their position, his answer was: “The Holy Ghost anathematizes
even angels, should they command aught beside the faith” (pp. 62-63). Maximus
does _not_ answer that Rome could not possibly do that, or that if Rome did
so, then Monothelitism would have to be accepted. That implies that St.
Maximus allowed that it is possible for the pope to err, at least when not
speaking in a definitive way.)",709

was is a historical matter, even though it involved a doctrinal matter, is one
I was prepared to make as well, so I am glad to see that come up.  
  
It is also a good point that if it was not a historical matter subject to
potential correctio and revision, how could later esteemed theologians
question or disagree with it? Good point again. We are basically saying that
juridical declarations of councils are not infallible, and thus in theory
reformable/correctable.  
  
That said, perhaps in favor of Feser's stance, I think one could say that we
need to accept the judgment of a council on the presumption they got it right,
even if we recognize that in principle it could be corrected later by a proper
authority, We could in fact even adduce evidence for why such a later
correction could be justified. BUT, to be safe, I don't think we would want to
take that evidence and determine for ourselves that the judgment was wrong, or
certainly declare such to others. I think we COULD, however, make a case that
we see how such an argument could be made, even if we accept the conclusions
of the council in the absence of such a process. (I say ""we"" rather than those
who would be in a position to review and correct such decisions, obviously.)

perhaps you would as well.",1427

it's possible to have total and absolute knowledge of anything. Even if I can
reason to it logically, there is a remote chance that I made an error at some
point.  
  
Now on matters like ""What is 2+2"" the odds of an error are astoundingly low to
the point we can just about dismiss it. But on something like ""What is the
true religion"", well, sure, I think the evidence points to Catholicism. I
might be wrong, but I have to do my best.",513

Thank you for your engagement and we will publish a reply in due course.  
  
In the meantime, I'd like to agree out that ""amassing"" the words of
theologians doesn't necessarily prove anything about Honorius himself. But the
purpose of the essay was not to prove Honorius to be innocent. Rather, it was
to show the untenability of the de Mattei method - which I think you too are
pursuing, Prof. Feser? - of basing conclusions about the modern crisis on
debated events and precedents in history.  
  
Typically the Honorius narrative is presented as if it were all certainly one
way (viz. official magisterial letters, certainly containing heresy, he was
certainly condemned as a heretic just as Sergius was, and so on) and then
either the authors draw conclusions from it about Francis etc, or just leave
innuendo hanging there.  
  
I'll address all this more fully in due course, as I said. Thank you again for

" _Is that swapping of caps problematic on your view?_  
  
No, this is no problem for me: I **expressly said** that if the pope (or any
other bishop) gives a caveat that makes it clear that they ARE NOT intending
their comment to be taken as ""official"" or not as from them qua _teacher_ , it
is not magisterial. (It may have been in the prior post that I said this. Not
sure which one.)  
  
_I'm reading you (maybe) as saying or implying that the assertions of a pope
in faith or morals cannot fail to be 'binding' on any Catholic to some extent,
whether the pope likes it or not; or maybe that this is so, at least by
default._  
  
I am saying that the ""bindingness"" is a matter of degree, just as is the
_intention_ and the _manner in which the intention is expressed_ are
manifestly capable of degree. All commentators agree that there are different
levels of authoritativeness to different kinds of papal documents, from
Apostolic Constitutions through encyclicals and such, down to other actions.
And all agree that the pope can emphasize his teaching with different levels
of formality and different levels of insistence. Just reading through JPII's
encyclicals gives you a wide range of statements he makes that land at widely
different levels of insistence that Catholics be guided by his teaching. It's
not an on/off switch, with nothing in between.  
  
_his 'manifest will' refers especially to his intention to teach and bind the
faithful of the world. Normally he will not express this intention in so many
words, but it can be known 'either from the character of the documents, from
his frequent repetition of the same doctrine, or from his manner of
speaking.'_  
  
These last points, i.e. _markers_ of the pope's intention, clearly are of the
kind that are capable of degree. Especially ""frequent repetition of the same
doctrine"" - if the pope (and the Church) want frequent repetition to be used
as a marker, it is necessarily the case that a teaching pass **_only
gradually_** from ""newly proposed"" to ""long-standing teaching"" by which the
Church expresses ""we're serious about this..."".",2108
"‘It is very common, doubtless, especially in religious controversy, to confuse
infallibility with certitude, and to argue that, since we have not the one, we
have not the other, for that no one can claim to be certain on any point, who
is not infallible about all; but the two words stand for things quite distinct
from each other. For example, I remember for certain what I did yesterday, but
still my memory is not infallible; I am quite clear that two and two makes
four, but I often make mistakes in long addition sums. I have no doubt
whatever that John or Richard is my true friend, but I have before now trusted
those who failed me, and I may do so again before I die.’  
  
‘A certitude is directed to this or that particular proposition; it is not a
faculty or gift, but a disposition of mind relatively to a definite case which
is before me. Infallibility, on the contrary, is just that which certitude is
not; it is a faculty or gift, and relates, not to some one truth in
particular, but to all possible propositions in a given subject-matter. We
ought in strict propriety, to speak, not of infallible acts, but of acts of
infallibility…’  
  
‘A man is infallible, whose words are always true; a rule is infallible, if it
is unerring in all its possible applications. An infallible authority is
certain in every particular case that may arise; but a man who is certain in
some one definite case, is not on that account infallible.’  
  
‘I am quite certain that Victoria is our Sovereign, and not her father, the
late Duke of Kent, without laying any claim to the gift of infallibility; as I
may do a virtuous action, without being impeccable. I may be certain that the
Church is infallible, while I am myself a fallible mortal; otherwise, I cannot
be certain that the Supreme Being is infallible, until I am infallible myself.
It is a strange objection, then, which is sometimes urged against Catholics,
that they cannot prove and assent to the Church's infallibility, unless they
first believe in their own. Certitude, as I have said, is directed to one or
other definite concrete proposition. I am certain of proposition one, two,
three, four, or five, one by one, each by itself. I may be certain of one of
them, without being certain of the rest; that I am certain of the first makes
it neither likely nor unlikely that I am certain of the second; but were I
infallible, then I should be certain, not only of one of them, but of all, and
of many more besides, which have never come before me as yet. Therefore we may
be certain of the infallibility of the Church, while we admit that in many
things we are not, and cannot be, certain at all.’

"Well, for one thing, I think it's a mistake to think of ""Magisterium"" as a
simple translation of ""teacher"", asif that's all we mean when we say it.
Clearly we're referring to the Church *intentionally exercising her authority
to teach in an official capacity*. I disagree a private letter is any sort of
official capacity.  
  
This is Bellomy. My phone won't let me log in.",374
" _1) Yes it was an act of the Magisterium, even from the Pope himself, thus 2)
Therefore the Magisterium is not protected even from heresy in its ordinary
teachings._  
  
What, specifically, makes you phrase the second as ""not protected from
_heresy_?""  
  
We know that the Church's fallible teachings (I.e. those which were not taught
infallibly) are ""not **absolutely** protected"" from ERROR, in that fallible
teachings are reformable and might eventually be reformed because they were
wrong and needed to be corrected.  
  
But one cannot conclude from this that the Church's fallible teachings are
therefore _utterly_ not protected from error, i.e. that there is simply
NOTHING that limits how much error they have. That doesn't follow. As I
understand it, the Church says of these teachings that they, too, are
influenced by the Holy Spirit, in a lesser way, such that the Church will not
fall into such error (on non-infallible teachings) that she _lastingly_ leads
Christians into grave error that endangers their souls. These criteria are
inherently difficult to apply to particular cases, but the basic _idea_ is
that, like situation where the Holy Spirit's action by which He molds the
teachings of the many bishops so that they (without formal collusion) all
teach the same thing so that it becomes an infallible teaching, so also at
other times He molds their teaching so that where one or some are in error,
others are not, or at least not gravely and for long. This is indeed a
protection, afforded to _the Church_ , that does not protect from every error,
rather from an error having a certain scale of effect.  
  
Clearly the Arian heresy running rampant was an error _in the ranks of
bishops_ so that they were teaching error, but it never swallowed the entire
episcopate. Since it is simply the case that the bishops who were Arians were
teaching _wrongly_ by their _officially demanding_ belief in Arianism, and

it possible that a Pope can err outside of his infallible pronouncements, it

operated on limited information on his writings and context, it still remains
true that a Pope can err. Perhaps more importantly, it remains true that the
more recent notion that a Pope can never err is foreign to the Catholic faith.
As it happens, the case of Honorius is mostly discussed today in the context
of this matter.

Oh, that was a easy agreement XD  
(Justin is right, lets complement)  
  
I can see the point of your view, it truly seems that our reasoning outside
mathematics is very uncertain. But, of course, disagreement by itself does not
says much. The evidence of the senses should be pretty certain and
uncontroversial but if you, say, go to a bunch of people that were there
during a discussion or even fight between two folks they care about, for
instance, you find that sense evidence can be the origin of disagreement as
well as metaphysics! If ideas matter to life, people will disagree.  
  
Our boy Descartes is simply wrong, we don't need certain knowledge to be
justified on our beliefs. Math deals with abstractions, so of course it will
have a degree of agreement than areas that deal with real life do not, every
step on the direction of particularity is a step away from certainty. And even
math has polemics, no?  
  
Anyway, i can see value in your epistemological criteria, specially on a non-
religious worldview, but it seems to me to ask for too much certitude. If we
have good reasons to a point of view on theology them we can believe in it.

"Now, one point that some readers have made is that the word “heresy” was used
in a more expansive way earlier in Church history than it is today. That is
correct and important, and it is something [I have elsewhere emphasized
myself](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2019/05/popes-heresy-and-papal-
heresy.html). In modern canon law, heresy is “the obstinate denial or
obstinate doubt after the reception of baptism of some truth which is to be
believed by divine and Catholic faith.” Pope Honorius was definitely _not_ a
heretic in that sense, both because there is no evidence of obstinacy on his
part, and because a charitable reading of his problematic statements supports
the judgment that he did not intend to undermine traditional teaching (even if
his words inadvertently had that effect). There are also the related points
that one could be a heretic in the _material_ sense of affirming something
doctrinally erroneous, while not being a _formal_ heretic in the sense of
persisting in the error even after being warned by ecclesiastical authority;
and that whether some doctrine has actually been defined by the Church is
relevant to whether it is “to be believed by divine and Catholic faith.”",1204

post-Vatican II popes as well as Honorius. Thus while I accept that Honorius
*might* have made a doctrinal error, that error would not lead anyone off the

defined by the Church and thus it would not have been sinful at the time to

I am breaking down the fairly complex sentence for purposes of analysis.  
  
""Does not this indeterminacy within we who have not yet suffered death mean
that as long as we argue about it, it can never be settled?""  
  
Leaving out the disputed phrase this becomes, ""Does not this indeterminacy
mean that it can never be settled?""  
  
Replacing the disputed phrase, with a single word object for the preposition,
this becomes, ""Does not this indeterminacy WITHIN SOME mean that it can never
be settled?""  
  
SOME = ""We who have not yet suffered death""  
  
This is a noun clause. It is the object of the preposition ""within"". It is a
dependent clause and must exist in some relation with the rest of the
sentence. It cannot stand alone as an independent sentence. The preposition
""within"" connects this dependent clause with the sentence. The entire clause
is the object of the preposition. Otherwise the rest of the clause, ""who have
not yet suffered death"", would be standing alone with no connection to the
sentence.  
  
Let us look at the clause in isolation by making it independent.  
  
""We, who have not yet suffered death, pause.""  
  
""Us, who have not yet suffered death, pause""  
  
You choose.  
  
""We pause"" or ""Us pause"" or perhaps ""Us paused"".  
  
Only the first sounds correct to me. You choose. I will not argue it further,
but I would still write it the way I did.  
  
I have a very interesting book on the relation between English and Latin
called ""English Grammar for Students of Latin"" by Norma W. Goldman. It does
not teach Latin grammar from English grammar or vice versa"". It helps to teach
Latin Grammar by showing how it is similar to and how it differs from English
grammar. One thing is immediately obvious in it; you do not get correct
English grammar by applying the rules of Latin grammar to English. In fact,
English is fundamentally a Germanic language with a large element of the
Romance languages admixed.  
  
It is true, however, that teachers and other English stylists have long tried
to make English follow Latin in grammatical style, something that seems
overwrought to me. I don't think this is as common as it was once.

"And by the way, I would offer the idea that this helps characterize true and
real **development** of doctrine that is binding, and separate it from
opposition and revolution or not-binding teaching: a true development, when
FIRST proposed, is normally _by that very fact_ not proposed as binding. It is
(normally) by dint of being then thoroughly fleshed out and worked out so that
its compatibility with all the _other_ doctrines that it is not meant to
unseat is clear. Even better, when the new development is expressed in a way
that _manifestly_ connects to and coordinates with the pieces of the prior
teachings that it IS meant to alter in some qualified way. It is true
development when a Catholic who accepted the old way of saying the teaching
can look at the new way and say of it: ""I see that this re-frames the old
concepts in a way that introduces a new distinction never made before, and is
not so much a _denial_ of the old teaching but a refinement of it."" When those
who have been holding to the old teaching CANNOT say anything like that,
indeed when the appearance (to them, in good faith) is that the new ""teaching""
really is just a flat out denial of the old, that's not _true development_ ,
and the **very lack of clarification given** should be taken as CONSTITUTING a
criterion by which the Church saying that the Church is not (yet) insisting on
the new ""teaching"" as binding.",1401
"For these reasons, I prefer to use the more general and less potentially
misleading term “error” when discussing the case of Honorius, as I did in the
title of my previous post. All the same, the Sixth Ecumenical Council does
apply the term “heretic” to Honorius, and “heresy” in those days implied at
the very least _positive doctrinal error_ (as opposed, say, to mere negligence
or a _failure to counter_ doctrinal error). In other words, by labeling
Honorius a heretic, the council was accusing him of teaching false doctrine.
The question on the table is whether he can be defended against this charge.",606

need to accept the judgment of a council on the presumption they got it right,
even if we recognize that in principle it could be corrected later by a proper
authority, We could in fact even adduce evidence for why such a later
correction could be justified._  
  
I admit I might be wrong on this point, but even this seems a little too
strong to me. It is simply a fact that on matters of history - which the
condemnation of Honorius is - it is in no way impious to judge that the
Council was wrong. One should do it respectfully, as the Saints Dr. Feser
references do, but you can absolutely question such judgments. If that were
not so, then Maximos, Bellarmie, and Alphonsus Liguori wouldn't question it.  
  
For example, Trent says that their teaching on indulgences goes back to the

"I once had reason to write to my bishop about a matter of faith that needed
clarification. His private, written response, delivered through his staff
theologian, constituted _for me_ an expression of his will to teach me in a
certain way, and his will that I accept his teaching. That it was a private
letter indicated _how broadly_ he intended his instruction to bind people, but
it did not detract from _whether_ he intended that I give his instruction my
assent. I could have _simply ignored_ his instructions ONLY by ignoring the
obligation to give religious submission to the teachings of the successors to
the Apostles, to whom Christ said ""he who hears you hears me"". The _manner_ of
my assent, i.e. the reserved assent proper to ""religious submission"" depends
quite definitely on the _nature of the reservations_ by which it falls short
of UNreserved assent, and this too owes its proper determination to the
_intention of the bishop_ , as to the manner and degree by which he intends to
bind his subordinate(s). And this he conveys in the very same manner as

"To sum up the doctrine of infallibility:  
  
Humans are fallible, except when protected by God from error, when they become
infallible. And how do we know this? Because fallible humans tell us so.  
  
P.S. Only my particular group of fallible humans is right about having access
to infallibility. The other groups -- Orthodox, Protestants, Muslims,
Catholics (delete as applicable) -- claiming access to infallibility are
wrong. After all, they're fallible humans and God has not protected them from
error. Whereas I'm a fallible human whom God has protected from error on this
particular topic.",597
"@Laudator Temporis Acti  
  
That other fallible humans have a subjective certainty Y, that contradicts a
subjective certainty X belonging to my own fallible self, is no proof that X
could not be recognised by me as objectively valid. (As with the colour of
Fluffy the cat in my previous post) it's only a problem if all I knew about X
and Y were that they were beliefs belonging to this or that person.  
  
If all the knowledge that we had access to was that 'I believe X, you believe
Y', then since we are all fallible, there would be no grounds for preferring X
over Y in regard to their objective certainty.  
  
But the presupposition that all the knowledge to which we have access is of
the form 'I believe X, you believe Y', is a type of philosophical idealism:
'All we can directly know is the fact that something is someone's belief - we
cannot have direct knowledge of evidence for these beliefs in themselves,
whereby we can discriminate which are true and which are false.'  
  
But we do not grant this unproven idealist presupposition (which furthermore
is contradicted by our very experience of having direct awareness of
evidence); and so we are not led to the relativist conclusion.  
  
In short, we are not reduced to saying, 'Fallible person A says X, fallible
person B says Y - who knows?' Each fallible individual can turn to the actual
evidence, by which valid objective certainties can be established in
particular cases - even if in other particular cases, someone (myself or
others) fails to properly examine the evidence, and so actualizes in those
particular cases the abstract possibility of falling into error.  
  
I agree that my background and life history makes it more likely for me to
have ended up a Catholic than e.g. a Hindu. But that proves nothing. My
background also makes it more likely that I will have a valid objective
certainty of Pythagoras' Theorem, than if I had been born in 3000 BC. For
every individual, particular contingent circumstances channel us into a
position where we are more favourably placed than we otherwise would have been
to discover objective evidence for this or that truth. That does not
invalidate our objective certainty of those truths, once we have seen the
evidence. Again the principle: we must examine the actual evidence regarding X
(not matters about our background that are logically irrelevant to the truth
or falsity of X).  
  
And just on a couple of your other points:  
  
I can agree for the sake of argument that Newman's example regarding the
trustworthiness of John or Richard is for our purposes the least satisfactory
of his examples, since the nature of the 'evidence' for their trustworthiness
raises all sorts of other questions. (His example is nonetheless perhaps a
useful corrective against modelling our understanding of certainty primarily
on our experience of mathematical certainty, rather than on e.g. certainties
that occur in interpersonal relationships.)  
  
And the passive infallibility (according to Catholic teaching) of the whole
Body of the Faithful guided by the Holy Spirit, has no bearing on the topic of
an admittedly fallible individual, Catholic or not, coming to a valid
objective certainty in a particular case, by rationally examining evidence.

Tom Cohoe  ",1262
"I am glad we agree on the subject of heresy, and retract my comment that you
were incorrect on that point.  
  
But your point about the Council still does not stand. They were in fact
making a *historical* claim in judging Honorius guilty of heresy. Councils can
be incorrect about historical claims. You say this:  
  
 _First, the reason a council condemns someone as a heretic is because of his
teaching. Hence it is, first and foremost, Honorius’s teaching that was
condemned. That means that the teaching was judged heretical. But whether a
teaching is heretical is a doctrinal matter, and not a mere historical matter.
Now, given that a papally-approved council cannot err on doctrinal matters, it
follows that the councils in question infallibly judged that Honorius’s
teaching was heretical (whatever his intentions). But since anyone who teaches
heresy is a heretic, it follows (at least given that Honorius really did write
the letters that got him into trouble, as most of his defenders concede) that
these councils did after all infallibly judge that Honorius was a heretic._  
  
This does not follow. The councils judged that *monotheilitism was a heresy*,
which is completely true. They then made the historical claim that *Honorius
was a heretic*, which is not protected by any infallible charism whatsoever.
The key point protected by infallibility is not that Honorius was a heretic;
it's that monothelitism is a heresy. Whether or not Honorius actually taught
monthelitism cannot be established merely by the council's say-so. That simply
is not a doctrinal claim.  
  
You then say this:  
  
 _Second, the reason most of Honorius’s defenders try to defend him is to
avoid having to acknowledge that a pope can teach heresy when not speaking ex
cathedra. Now, suppose that the councils did indeed get it wrong when judging
that Honorius, specifically, was a heretic. Since that is a historical rather
than doctrinal matter, such an error is possible. Still, by making this
judgment, the councils also taught by implication that it is possible for a
pope to teach heresy (when not speaking ex cathedra). And that is a doctrinal
matter. That is enough to refute the larger claim that Honorius’s defenders
are trying to uphold by defending him._  
  
A Pope can speak heresy, potentially; a Pope cannot teach heresy in the
capacity of utilizing his magisterial authority to bind the faithful to
religious assent of will, because then the Magisterium would be leading the
faithful off the path of salvation. And as you happily acknowledge, what the
councils were condemning as heresy is not the understanding that Vatican I
used and is in fact not sinful, because monothelitism had yet to be condemned
directly in a Church council or by an authoritative papal teaching.  
  
Also, I am supremely unconvinced that a private letter can ever be an act of
Magisterial teaching in any case, and not simply the private opinion of the
man who happened to be Pope.  
  
Also you say this:  
  
 _Wright neglects to mention the opinion of St. Francis de Sales, who, when
addressing papal authority in The Catholic Controversy, says that “we do not
say that the Pope cannot err in his private opinions, as did John XXII, or be
altogether a heretic, as perhaps Honorius was” (p. 225)._

condemning Honorius, merely mentioning in passing that he PERHAPS was a
heretic. That's not even commentary, just a brief mention of a controversy.",3522
"""Would this not also apply to your reasoning here?""  
  
Yes, it does. I am obviously shaped by the random factors of where and when
and what I was born. That's one reason why I like math, where all manner of
folk can reach consensus on important truths without rancor or resentment
(mostly). Theology, alas, behaves like politics, not like math.",346
"The bishop's office of ""teacher"" is not exercised ONLY when he _expressly_
""intends to bind the faithful"" in an _unreserved_ way, for a bishop _cannot_
bind the faithful in that way because he is not infallible. But he still
exercises the office of teacher when he teaches in such a way that he expects
his people to hear _and receive and be guided by_ his teaching. This is what
the magisterial office _means_. The pope, in exercising his _ordinary_ office
of bishop of Rome, exercises the same magisterial authority as any bishop
does. But by being the pope, his teaching acts also teach the whole world. It
is impossible for him to teach ""just Rome"" and not implicitly teach to the
world.  
  
Just as is true of ALL the bishops, who teach their teachings in various
**degrees** of definitude by which they intend others to receive them, so also
does the pope. When he indicates, by details such as formality of venue, tone
of voice, and declarative mood, that a teaching is more definitive than usual,
we are obliged to give it a greater degree of respect, (i.e. to assent to it
with less _reserve_ than usual). As a result of these truths, it will be
automatically the case that when the pope wishes to be _especially_
definitive, he will typically be doing so especially _to the world_. But even
THERE, he has degrees available: if the pope gives a speech to an
international forum of obstetricians and speaks there about the immorality of
certain tubal ligations (as contraceptive), it is inevitable that he be
speaking broadly to the whole world, in that those doctors are from the whole
world and will repeat his teaching around the world. But the venue is not as
_formal_ as an encyclical, and so has a lesser degree of definitude - lesser
sense that he ""intends to bind"" - as to that aspect. The intention he has is
CAPABLE OF DEGREE. Hence the deference we give it must be capable of degree.  
  
Once we realize that religious assent - the kind of assent that is not the
""unreserved"" assent given to infallible teachings - is **reserved** assent, we
must realize that it comes in many flavors just as do the reservations by
which it is not **UN** reserved. And the _intention to bind_ is also present
in many degrees.",2230
"I am not talking about mere leading astray. I am talking about leading someone

Bellomy here. My phone will not let me log in.",275
"Dr. Ed Feser gives a brief rundown of the “error” and condemnation of Pope
Honorius I (625-638). He draws mostly from the Patristic scholarship of great
Fr. John Chapman who was a remarkable scholar on the early Papacy and the
issues related to the Latin vs Byzantine Churches throughout the first seven
ecumenical Councils. In my own research, I have come to think that Fr.
Chapman’s is perhaps the best sketch and explanation of the events surrounding
Honorius. There can be no question that Pope St. Leo II, the very Pope who
confirmed the decrees of the Council of Constantinople III (681), that is, the
very council which had accused Pope Honorius of heresy, believed that his
predecessor Honorius had committed a heresy. There can be no question that,
including Constantinople III, three more ecumenical synods repeated the
anathema against Honorius for heresy. Moreover, in the Roman Breviary, up
until the 18th century, included a description of Honorius as a “heretic” for
June 28th, the feast of the Pope who executed Honorius’s condemnation (St. Leo
II). There also can be no question that these Councils, Popes, theologians,
canonists, and general Christian thinkers understood Honorius as a heretic.
Though, you have some exceptions.  
  
One thing that Feser does not venture deeply into is the question of what kind
of “heretical crime” was proven at the Council in 681 over Honorius, a man who
had died 42 years prior to its convocation. At best, Honorius can be convicted
of material heresy since the form added to the matter of heresy has to be
proven. Moreover, since the doctrine of two-wills in Christ was not
definitively settled, even a material heresy in this regard (according to
Catholicism’s developed canon law) could not, of itself, situate one into the
canonical crime of heresy nor the status of mortal sin. Otherwise, we would
have to anathematize the person and memory of St Thomas Aquinas for his
rejection of the Immaculate Conception. But that is impossible since Pope
Sixtus condemned anyone who would accuse another for mortal sin or canonical
heresy when the matter had not yet been resolved by the Apostolic See. While
the Council of Constantinople III cannot be said to have worked with these
parameters, those parameters did become standard and acceptable to Catholic
canon law, jurisprudence, and pastoral theory. It is practical today.  
  
What lessons, asks Feser, can be drawn from Honorius for us today? I think the
most that can be drawn is that a Pope can commit a doctrinal error. But that a
Pope could become teach heresy and thereby become a formal heretic is not
illustrated by the Honorius-event. One might argue that the Honorius-event
lends great precedent that such a thing could, in theory, happen. But there is
nothing in the Honorius-event, according to developed Catholic beliefs on the
nature of heresy and its criminality, that illustrates that precedent. Now, if
we revert back to the standards of the Latin and Greek policies during the 7th
century, then it is a foregone conclusion, a Pope can become a formal heretic.
But it seems to me that we cannot ignore the canonical, theological, and
pastoral developments that have taken place since Honorius to the present day.  
  
For a more relevant historical context wherein a Pope committed an error while
in office, coupling form and matter (but perhaps not pertinacity), you would
have to study the Three Chapters controversy under Emperor Justinian regarding
the Constituta of Pope Vigilius.  
  
PS. For the life of me, when I read Honorius’s letters, my own private
judgment does not see him as a true Monothelite. His statements, as

Yes, you're right and I apologize for the adolescent, narcissistic and sinful
nature of my blustering response. Empty words, as you said. I hope you've
forgiven me for it. I would like to accept Catholicism, but infallibility is
something that I can't see as proven.  
  
This is why I don't think I am obsessed by infallibility, which is an
extraordinary claim that has very interesting philosophical, psychological and
sociological implications. Nor do I think I have fallen into an infinite
regress. There's an infinite loop, maybe:  
  
""I can fly unaided.""  
""Amazing! Please show me.""  
""There's no point, because YOU can't fly unaided."" (etc)  
  
My point about math is this: when they're mathematicians doing math,
Catholics, Orthodox, Protestants, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, atheists, black folk,
white folk, sinners, saints, et al all happily agree about important results
and accept complex proofs. Those groups obviously don't do that in theology.
There are things at work in theology that aren't at work in math.",1115
"""truth does not correspond with popularity.""  
  
It does in math. Only lunatics and the mathematically illiterate reject things
like the impossibility of squaring the circle (under the classic conditions).
But mathematicians don't claim to be infallible. They don't need to, because
their proofs are objective.  
  
""Philosophy isn't theology.""  
  
They overlap and the arguments for infallibility fall within philosophy. In
any case, you haven't addressed the question of why there are competing
versions of infallilibility.",527
"Some have emphasized that Pope St. Leo II, in his own statement, seems to
accuse Honorius only of aiding and abetting heresy rather than condemning him
for being a heretic himself, as the Third Council of Constantinople had. They
seem to think this absolves Honorius of the charge of heresy. But there are
several problems with this move. First, as Chapman notes, in one respect Leo’s
statement is _harsher_ than the council’s, not less harsh. For Leo goes so far
as to accuse his predecessor of _polluting the purity of the Roman See itself_
, which the council had not done. Second, Leo did confirm the council, and
thereby lent authority to its decrees. And those decrees explicitly condemn
Honorius as a heretic. Third, the later councils, as well as the later papal
oath, reaffirmed Honorius’s anathematization.",816
"The Church can canonize the dead and infallibly decree they are Saints. But
can She infallibly say a specific individual is in Hell? I was always under
the impression She canna'? Are Her judgements a specific individual is a
heretic infallible? If so then no heretic can appeal his judgement once it is
handed down.  
  
But the Church is infallible in formally condemning a false doctrinal or moral
proposition attributed to a heretic.  
  
Feeneyism is a heresy. But maybe Fr. Feeney wasn't a heretic? A thesis a
grouchy trad I used to bump heids with used to claim. He told me Fr. Feeney
never denied Baptism by desire & that was a novelty invented later by some of
his followers. That could be true in principle.  
  
So Honorius being called a heretic by many councils and Popes is well
ambiguous. Like many of Pope Francis' teachings. :D LOL!!!!

"Hi Tom  
  
The sentence in which I used novelty merely emphasized the point of these
posts namely to demonstrate that it is possible for a pope to commit heresy
and it has happened before.  
  
Here's what I said  
  
""hence the urgency to show that it is possible for a Pope to commit heresy so
that it isn't seen as some kind of novelty""  
  
In this very post he mentions  
  
""The lessons of the case of Honorius are clear. When a pope is not speaking ex
cathedra, it is possible for him to fall into error. ""  
  
To quote Prof. Feser from twitter while he was replying to someone who
questioned that the arguments in this post are also used by heretical
catholics (sedes, liberals) to habitually disagree with Papal statements  
  
""But there are also people whose faith is shaken because they think they're
expected to swallow that which contradicts past doctrine. There's a danger in
not addressing that worry by keeping silent about the possibility of
legitimate disagreement merely because some abuse it.""  
  
It doesn't seem that I said anything different, danger implies urgency.  
  
As for what you mentioned about the abuse scandals, personally, I feel it's a
bit uncharitable to lay all of the blame at the feet of Pope Francis, 99% of
the all the abuse took place preceding this papacy and were just revealed
during this papacy, obviously there have been some hush ups which should be
criticised but those same kind of cover ups took place on a very large scale
during Pope St JPII's papacy, And even Pope Benedict was aware of Mccarrick
and had already imposed some sanctions. How Prelates may choose to respond to
some scandal is a matter of Prudence, prudence maybe wrong at times. There has
also been large scale reform though in regards to the issue though, such as
making the reporting process easier, efforts to make the process more
transparent, candidates to priesthood are also scrutinized to a very high
degree, so there has been some positive change.  
  
As for heresy with regards to sexual morality being perpetuated at the highest
level, with regards to same sex marriage and blessings of such couples and the
like, the document by the CDCF which was put out awhile ago was quite firm,
Pope Francis approved it. Is it not better to go by an official statement then
by unconfirmed reports of someone reporting what the Pope allegedly told them.  
  
With regards to Amoris Latetia, Orthodox Theologians like Mathew Levering have
shown that the texts in doubt can be given an orthodox interpretation.
Obviously it would be better if Pope Francis answered the Dubium himself and
we could criticise him for that. But that doesn't entail that this issue is
such that people have cause to question their faith especially when orthodox  
Interpretations have been offered. In the absence of clarification, one ought
to charitably go with the orthodox interpretation while respectfully awaiting
a reply. If you are someone with a high position in Rome you could even
respectfully use your influence to perhaps prompt some response.  
  
  
As for ""leaving heterodox opinion at the highest levels standing without clear
or any correction"", It can even be argued that Pope John Paul II did the same
with Walter Kasper by promoting him who evidently has a heretical postion on
the very issue of divorce. Pope Benedict XVI while obviously and sternly
disagreeing with him on this issue, did appraisingly mention Kasper's book on
Christ in the intro to his final books on the new testament and Christ.  
  
Also if I feel that something should be expressed in a particular way, why
can't I suggest it, whether it's taken or not is irrelevant and doesn't change
my admiration and respect for Prof.

"The case is briefly discussed in many Church histories and reference works,
but an especially detailed account is to be found in Fr. John Chapman’s short
book _The Condemnation of Pope Honorius_ , which was published in 1907 by the
Catholic Truth Society. You can read it online [via the Internet
Archive](https://archive.org/details/a620530200chapuoft). Chapman is also the
author of [the article about Pope
Honorius](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07452b.htm) in the 1910 _Catholic
Encyclopedia_ , which presents a shorter but still substantive account. His
results are briefly but approvingly discussed by Fr. Cuthbert Butler in his
1930 book _The Vatican Council 1869-1870_ , the main scholarly work in English
about the council and the debate between the council Fathers over papal
infallibility.",803
"_It is still more important that the formula for the oath taken by every new
Pope from the 8 th century till the 11th adds these words to the list of
Monothelites condemned: “ **Together with Honorius, who added fuel to their
wicked assertions**.”_ (pp. 115-16)",261
"I always thought when Honorius said in his letter to Sergus that in Christ
there was one will he meant ""the two wills are in harmony"" and he was going
against the idea there where two contrary wills in Christ. Like I can say Ed
Feser and James Scott are of one will on the Divine Origin of the Catholic
Faith.  
But it doesn't mean Dr. Feser and I dinna' have our own distinct wills.  ",385
"But Honorius himself, and not merely his words, was also condemned, in terms
no less harsh:",91
"Well if you just take a quick online survey of all the orthodox catholic
philosophers/academics (Dr Matthew Levering, Dr Chris Kaczor, Dr Scott Hahn ,
Dr Michael Patrick Barber, Dr Jennifer Frey, Dr Robert P George etc) and
analyse their public statements , you would probably find that Prof Feser has
been the most critical and open about his reservations with regards to this
papacy.  
  
As for negativity, the very reason why there has been an increase of posts on
these topics is that, Prof.Feser thinks that Pope Francis is close to
committing heresy, hence the urgency to show that it is possible for a Pope to
commit heresy so that it isn't seen as some kind of novelty, which is kind of
a bleak or negative outlook don't ya think ?  
  
I mean instead of preparing for the worst, might it not be better to pray for
the best, to pray that such a scenario doesn't arise in the first place, to
pray that the Holy Spirit grant Pope Francis sound wisdom.  
  
As for bitterness, well perhaps that was bit of an overstatement but if you
look at some of Prof Feser's passages over the years, to quote him  
  
""Pope Honorius’s errors were not condemned until forty years after his death.
Further examples could easily be given. Few people remember these events now,
because things eventually worked themselves out so completely that they now
look like blips. If the world is still here centuries from now, Pope Francis’s
chaotic reign will look the same way to Catholics of the future. ""  
  
Prof Feser's absolute disdain for the papacy has been quite evident.  
  ",1568
"And as long as I am at it: can we please get people to STOP referring to some
teaching as ""belonging"" to a special class of the "" _ordinary and universal
magisterium_ ,"" when it is taught universally by the bishops around the world.
That's not what the statement in Vatican II on the infallibility that is
possible to the bishops means. Rather: when the bishops in their sees around
the world exercise their ORDINARY office of teacher, teach the same truth as
certain and ""to be held"", and when there is a (moral) unanimity in their so
teaching, THEN that teaching is infallibly held out to the faithful. There
isn't some special class of magisterium that is an ""ordinary and universal""
one. It's when the particular acts of the bishops in their ordinary office as
teacher are universally in union on a teaching.  
  
Each individual bishop, in so teaching, would not (at first) be able to say
""this is proposed as infallible"", because each one alone hasn't that kind of
authority. But _the Holy Spirit_ can cause the teaching to be proposed
infallibly _by the CHURCH_ by causing the bishops around the world to teach
the same thing. Then it is infallibly taught. But each bishop is just
exercising his ordinary role (and authority) as ""teacher"", i.e. ""magister.""",1263
"All concede that a Pope can error in his non-definitive but authoritative
magisterium(i.e. non-infallible). The question is to what extent can he error?
It is also wrong to view such magisterial teaching as not having any more
divine protection than that of any other Catholic, be they theologian or even
Bishop. And the argument is that although error is possible, it is limited and
there is protection against teaching grave errors that could endanger the
souls of the faithful -because hundreds of millions of ordinary catholics
aren't in a position to weigh each non-infallible but authoritative teaching
and ""decide"" if the Pope is somehow contradicting a prior teaching that was
CLEARLY taught definitively under the charism of infallibility - and only then
give their ""religious assent of will and intellect"". Their is limited
permission to dissent to such teaching and that presupposes the knowledge and
capacity to judge such matters - over and against the Holy See who must have
already made such a judgement before issuing the teaching.  
  
As for the Honorius case, you make the best case for your ""side"" but I am not
compelled. Have read these detailed debates for years from both sides and I
side with Bellarmine (other than the ""forgery"" defense) and his successors who
have since made more detailed arguments than his to push back on the points
you and the Catholic Encyclopedia author legitimately raise.",1422
"Dear Kevin  
  
Thank You for your kind of reply.  
  
Yes I do agree misleading souls away from salvation is a heinous crime.  
  
And I agree with your take on the punishment as well.  
  
My point was just that the rightful desire for someone's punishment shouldn't
be the make or break with regard to our faith. Maybe there won't ever be an
ideal Pope who will uphold everything. As I mentioned in the above example,
it's possible that one may get a Pope who is orthodox in all respects except
for the death penalty where he is inspired by NNLT.  
  
While being a part of the Church on Earth, Our faith should extend beyond this
world to the Church in Heaven.  
  
God will decide who gets punished and who won't, maybe that might be in our
accordance with our judgement or maybe it won't.  
  
But our faith should remain steady nevertheless.  
  
Again Thanks for you kind reply :)  ",890
"(continued from previous post)  
  
So, in the case of Honorius, we see this distinction between formal and
material heresy is not made, and the question of whether it could have been
formally heretical is challenged by the fact that in his own lifetime (at
least while holding the Chair), Honorius himself would have been the final
court of appeal. Assuredly he would not have taken his own view to be
heretical. So right there there seems to be a strong reason to declare he was
at least not a FORMAL heretic. But this takes us to the question of the
authority of FUTURE councils and Popes. Many questions arise.  
  
First, it seems to me that while current popes have primacy of jurisdiction,
and infallibility in ex cathedra teaching, their juridical judgments are not
infallible (leaving aside the issue of the infallibility of canonizations of
saints). But of course, in their time no one would have the authority to
ignore or override a Pope's juridical judgment. Vatican I makes this much
clear. BUT, could such a person still believe, privately or publicly, that a
current pope's judgment was wrong, even while admitting that neither he (that
person himself) nor anyone other than the Pope could juridically do anything
about this? It seems this would be the case, though it would also be within
the Pope's power to discipline such a person.  
  
So, it does seem possible that a Pope could wrongly judge that someone was not
in heresy, or that the person was heretical, but juridically that judgment
would still have to be honored, since the current Pope would have the final
say in such matters. (to be continued)

""I feel it's a bit uncharitable to lay all of the blame at the feet of Pope
Francis""  
  
Who has done that? Meanwhile, Francis is the pope now, so his actions will
naturally get the most attention.  
  
I have not been criticizing Pope Francis, but ""Amoris Laetitia"" (which you
mention), the Pope's communication, has prompted many criticisms of the lack
of guidance from the Pope, and if these criticisms were not well founded, the
plain, simply spoken guidance becomes all the more important. That people feel
the absence of this is a problem. The suffering of people who feel, rightly or
wrongly, that the Church is going off the rails needs urgent attention, not
""official"" statements or abstruse theology from people no one has heard of. It
needs careful shepherding by the person who issued the letter - the Pope.  
  
That its absence is no excuse for loss or destabilization of faith really says
nothing. No one has excuses for their sins, and yet everyone faces attacks
caused by imperfect trust in God precisely because we are human, and that is
why loving pastoral guidance is needed. ""Let God sort them out, I know why
their fears are unjust"" is insufficient. The absence of this guidance is fair
game for criticism. The respectful waiting that you advise justifiably grows
into real criticism with time. It is in a sense an abandonment of the straying
sheep who need to be brought back into the fold.

"Then there is the fact that the Third Council of Constantinople condemned
Honorius. Here too Bellarmine suggests that one strategy to defend Honorius
would be to propose that the relevant passages from the council proceedings
were faked, and inserted by enemies of Rome. But the council proceedings
elsewhere _praise_ Rome and other popes, so what sense would this have made?
Alternatively, Bellarmine suggests, perhaps the council really did condemn
Honorius, but did so under the mistaken assumption that he was a heretic. This
is not a problem, Bellarmine says, because a council can be mistaken about a
historical (as opposed to doctrinal) matter. But even if the council had been
mistaken about Honorius, in condemning him it was teaching that popes can
(when not speaking _ex cathedra_ ) be guilty of heresy, and _that is_ a
doctrinal matter. The larger lesson of the case of Honorius (namely that popes
can err when not teaching _ex cathedra_ ) would remain, whatever one thinks of

"A helpful and informative discussion. I will break up my reflection in
multiple posts, since what I have to say is too long for a single comment.  
  
One point I see consistently unmentioned in various assessments of Honorius I
have read online over the years, though, is the importance of the distinction
between formal and material heresy. I do not know when this distinction came
to be (ahem) formally recognized in Catholic thought, but I suspect it was
after the period of Honorius.  
  
What is significant in this in respect to the later Vatican I's declaration of
papal primacy of jurisdiction is that the Pope himself is the final court of
appeal. Hence, in many cases someone might not be aware of their heresy, and
hold it materially but not formally (insofar as they are not consciously and
obstinately asserting a view contrary to the teaching of the Church, as made
clear to them by the ecclesial authorities). In other words, it is ultimately
up the ecclesial authorities, and ultimately via appeal to the Pope himself,
to declare a view heretical.  
  
It seems that it is only at that point that one who continues to hold the
problematic view can be definitively called a formal heretic (such would apply
earlier, of course, if the person himself acknowledged his view was heretical,
but said he did not care, etc.). But in the case of one who does not consider
his view heretical, it would require ecclesial judgment, and even this could
be overridden by the Pope via appeal. That would be the final say, at least in
that Pope's lifetime (another wrinkle in the case of Honorius, on which i'll
comment more in a moment).

"Erick, Vatican I explains how those Councils condemning Pope Honorius for his
failings must be interpreted. For the First Vatican Council cites the Fourth
of Constantinople: ""For in the apostolic see the catholic religion has always
been preserved unblemished"", which is hardly consistent with a heretical Pope
not long prior to it. The Vatican Council defines: ""This gift of truth and
never-failing faith was therefore divinely conferred on Peter and his
successors in this see..."". The quality of never-failing faith (not exactly
the same thing as speaking ex cathedra) has to be understood as pertaining to
all Popes, including Honorius. The task of theologians is to interpret the
case of Honorius with this understanding in mind, I would suggest, rather than
have too many hangups about inflammatory language by oriental bishops that
confounded (as we understand it today) formal heresy with aiding and abetting.

magisterium. The most spectacular case is that of Pope Honorius I (pope from

"Hi Ed,  
  
You write that ""Honorius, unlike Agatho, was capable of erring in his own
letter because he was not there speaking ex cathedra."" I have to say that this
statement is anachronistic. The term ""ex cathedra"" dates from the Middle Ages,
and the modern doctrine of papal infallibility was first proposed by bishop
Guido Terreni in 1332. To be sure, the formula of Hormisdas (519) declares
that ""in the Apostolic See the Catholic religion has always been kept
unsullied,"" but (a) it was written before Honorius became Pope, (b) it refers
to the Apostolic See, not the Roman Pope, and (c) it says nothing about there
being different categories of papal pronouncements (reformable and
irreformable).  
  
You also suggest that in the case of a future Pope who, while not speaking ex
cathedra, nevertheless teaches error, the Church ""will come to judge harshly
any pope who fomented such a crisis."" I'm not so sure. The reason why the
third ecumenical council of Constantinople (680-681) was able to condemn Pope
Honorius was precisely because its bishops had never been handpicked by him,
whereas today, all bishops in the Latin Church are appointed by the Pope, and
typically, most of the Cardinals who will elect the next Pope were handpicked
by the current one. Thus it appears extremely unlikely that the bishops,
speaking in unison, will judge any Pope harshly. Cheers.",1377

The following is just a sample of the part of the random subsequence that
describes physical reality as we sense it in which, tomorrow, say, 128 ceases

my idea. The klutziness of my idea and the subsequence describing the future

technique for causing this cchange. In God, the situation where 128 is prime
and 127 is prime, is beautiful. And remember, this is a simulation as a
computer program. It is logical because the computer is a logic machine with a
logical substrate producing all the virtual simulations.  
  
So in tomorrow's representation, when the new subsequence comes into play,
whenever the question of prime or composite concerning 127 or 128 arises, the
subsequence that is the virtual reality program now also runs the sub-sub-
sequence that was missing in the part of the program representing times
heretofore. The new stuff just adds 1 to 128 or 127, calculates whether the
sum is prime or a power of 2 using the old rules, and pops out the new answer
for the numbers before the addition was made.  
  
Voila, 127 is a power of 2 and 128 is a prime number.

"I want to pick up on something that Todd said, above:  
  
_authoritative magisterium (i.e. non-infallible)_  
  
I have seen phrases similar to this in many comments (not just blog comments,
but (probably even more) news articles and editorial comments in published
sources. I want to cry 'foul' on the idea of an ""authoritative magisterium"" of
the pope, being somehow a distinct category from his other stuff that he
teaches that is, you know, NOT ""authoritative"" or not ""magisterial"" or not
""authoritatively magisterial"".  
  
**There ain't no sich category"".**  
  
At least, that's what I am inclined to argue, though I am willing to be given
better material to become educated on the issue.  
  
Pope's generally don't go around stating which of their teachings are
""authoritative"" or ""magisterial"". By coming from a bishop, they automatically
_participate_ in the magisterial office of the Church. That's it. All bishops
participate in that office, and they are all _authoritative_ when they
exercise their authority to teach. Period.  
  
The bishops (all of them) _must necessarily_ participate in the magisterial
office of the Church in order to be the agents by which a teaching be
infallibly taught _by the universal magisterium of the bishops around the
world_. If they can do it SOME of the time, then they **have** the role. And
they all have the authority.  
  
Now, there are indeed different _degrees_ by which those teachings enjoy the
protection of the Holy Spirit. THAT's open to ""full"" versus something lesser.
A pope has a heavier hand in that _being protected_ than other bishops, but
his participation in the magisterial office isn't _utterly_ unlike that of the
other bishops. He can still err (as proven), and (more importantly) _just like
the other bishops_ his teachings are capable of DIFFERENT DEGREES of
commanding that respect that comes under ""religious assent"" from the people of
the Church. A pope, just like other bishops, teaches some things mildly, some
things firmly, and some things _very_ firmly, without invoking the
infallibility of an ex cathedra declaration. Similarly, popes (and other
bishops) teach some things _in identical fashion_ as those before him for many
centuries had, for some things, while on other things he sets out with a new
metaphor, or a new explanation for an old doctrine, and _all the degrees in
between_ that carry all the possible degrees of assertiveness.  
  
AND THEY DON'T SIT THERE TELLING US WHERE EACH STATEMENT LANDS on these scales
of firmness, traditionalness, etc. Indeed, if anything, the popes and bishops
are _highly_ reticent to STATE EXPLICITLY anything about how firmly our
obligation of religious assent kicks in for most of the things they say. We
are left discerning that by _various markers_ that are available, including
tradition, tone of 'voice', type of teaching occasion or document, etc. But
(short of a solemn declaration by an ecumenical council) these markers make
such discernment a chore and often only _probable_. Such, I think, is the life
of the educated Catholic.  
  
I would propose that the only teaching stuff that comes from the bishops that
is ""not magisterial"" is the stuff that they themselves SAY is uncertain,
putting in qualifiers like ""I feel that this is right, but I don't insist upon
it"" and ""there is room for disagreement on this"" and so on. Everything else is
""teachings"" and therefore is magisterial. That's what the office of bishop
implies.",3468

In the second part of the two part comment, the sentence ""In God, the

"Melkman, you seem to be fusing two different issues: the first is the
difference between material heresy and formal heresy. Material heresy is
believing X when the Church has taught not-X. You can do this by merely NOT
KNOWING that the Church has taught not-X. Formal heresy adds to the material
heresy the necessary spiritual ingredient of holding the proposition X
obstinately, in the face of the Church's teaching, being aware _that the
Church teaches not-X_. This is the sin of heresy in its formal aspect.  
  
Then there is another distinction, having the sin of heresy, versus the
ecclesiastical crime of heresy. If you obstinately hold X, but _never tell or
act on that belief_ , you could not be held guilty in a Church court for the
ecclesiastical crime, because there would be no knowledge of the fact. So your
heresy could become publicly declared. So it would not be ""formally""
determined heresy, by which you mean "" **officially** NAMED 'the sin of
heresy' by the Church"".  
  
And then there is the distinction between holding an X where the Church has
taught not-X, but in which not-X is _not a formally defined dogma to be
affirmed with Catholic faith, or a definitive teaching ""to be held""
unreservedly_ but a lesser position, taught (""merely"") as a firm tradition.
While a Church court might find you guilty of some crime or other in publicly
asserting X, it wouldn't necessarily be that of ""heresy"" as defined in the
canons. For the latter, the teaching of not-X must be a definitive one, a
teaching on which the Church has **definitively** resolved the debate. So, you
could be found obstinately sinful in holding error, but not that of ""
**formally defined** "" error.  
  
Your point seems to be that even if the position stated by Honorius was
actually material heresy, (a) maybe he wasn't guilty of the obstinacy
necessary for the sin, and (b) nobody in the Church could have successfully
carried out an ecclesiastical trial to _determine_ his guilty status so that
it could be OFFICIALLY DECLARED to be ""heresy"" to all. erick below points out
the additional issue that the true answer had not yet been defined.  
  
To all of this, I will submit: the point of this post is not to answer whether
a pope might be _officially declared_ a heretic, or whether a pope might hold
a position that had already been _officially defined_ to be wrong, but to
discuss whether a pope might ever hold (and teach) what is, materially,
erroneous, on faith and morals; and do so when he _should have known better_
even if the Church had not yet officially defined the issue.",2581
"_How was it possible to assert this, and yet in the same breath to condemn
Pope Honorius as a heretic? The answer is surely plain enough. Honorius was
fallible, was wrong, was a heretic, precisely because he did not, as he should
have done, declare authoritatively the Petrine tradition of the Roman Church.
To that tradition he made no appeal, but had merely approved and enlarged upon
the half-hearted compromise of Sergius_. (p. 109)",436
"The lessons of the case of Honorius are clear. When a pope is not speaking _ex
cathedra_ , it is _possible_ for him to fall into error. And if, in that
context, he teaches something contrary to the traditional teaching of the
Church, he _will_ fall into error – and may thereby lead others into error as
well, with catastrophic consequences for the Church. But the Church will in
such a situation nevertheless right herself before long, and will come to
judge harshly any pope who fomented such a crisis.",504

There is much disagreement and wrangling. Look at the foundations of

There is nothing that cannot be proven by some mathematician, somewhere, using
his version of what constitutes a proof and his version of what the meaning of
mathematics is.  
  
Theology is more distant from concrete human experience than mathematics is,
so the possibility of disagreement among theologians should not be surprising
or upsetting or something to base a conviction upon that it is about nothing
or that there is no truth or that we can not make progress towards truth. But
if God, infinitely beyond our understanding, is truth, then we cannot see it

"Also I find interesting another hypothetical scenario. I think one that
suggests that we shouldn't hold to very idealistic views of what a Pope should
be.  
  
From all the articles over the years, one might get the impression that Prof
Feser's biggest beef with Pope Francis has been with regards to the death
penalty.  
  
Now,  
Suppose a very orthodox Pope is appointed who doesn't make ambiguous
statements, who upholds traditional norms on sexual morality, gender,
abortion, liturgy in a stern way.  
  
But there's a catch, he is very inspired by the works of Prof Robby George,
John Finnis, E Christian Brugger, Germain Grisez.  
  
He comes to formally declare that the death penalty is intrinsically evil,
what should be our reaction ? What would be Prof Feser's reaction ? I think
that he would be just as negative and critical and bitter as he is now even
though given Pope Francis at the moment, I think it's understandable and
justifiable but with the aforementioned hypothetical scenario I don't think it
would be.  
  
Like personally I think that the death penalty is legitimate and is not an
intrinsically evil act  
  
However this ongoing tussle on this issue among orthodox Theologians has been
intriguing to watch.  
  
Germain Grisez has never been disciplined by the CDCF, he was in fact called
for consultation on Veritatis Splendor.

I honestly don't have a mission against Prof.Feser, I mean if I did, I
wouldn't post on the blog in the first place, nor would I have complemented
this post as informative if you look to my very first post. I have always
admired Prof. Feser's work and eagerly await all his new work including blog
posts  
  
Also to be fair to myself, I didn't mention Professor Feser by name in my
first post which was related to the article, I only alluded to a certain
section of the article namely the ending which I personally thought may come
off in a certain away. I admit that the initial snide comment (cheers etc) was
in retrospect not required and uncharitable on my part. But in that entire
first post if you look at it, there wasn't any reference to Prof but only my
take on faith and punishment.  
  
In the second post where I did mention Prof Feser by name (negative,
critical), I also mentioned ""justifiably"" and ""understandably"". I even
mentioned justifiably so as to suggest that the frustration and overall bleak
outlook on this papacy can indeed be justified. And can even be the subject of
an interesting and wholesome exchange like the one we had now. Even I become
negative and critical from time to time. It isn't really wrong to be so. Again
I admit the word ""bitter"" was a bit of an overstatement. I think what I was
going for was is, ""exasperated"" with this papacy.

scenario where a Pope who was orthodox in every except the death penalty and
ponder on what would be or should be our reactions. I indicated that Prof's
reaction would be more or less similar to what it is now however you may
classify it. And I also indicated that I am unsure of what my reaction would
be in that hypothetical scenario, maybe it could be just like Prof's. I was
namely looking for answers on that, on what should be our reaction, not
passing judgement as such on anyone.",2143
"Tony, thank you for taking the time to read my posts. I am not clear on what
issues you think I am fusing, but I THINK it is that i did not distinguish
formal heresy from the ecclesiastical crime of heresy.  
  
If I understand you correctly, I would say that my posts presume a case where
a person does not consider his views to be heretical (as I would presume was
the case with Honorius). I understand that a person could admit to knowing his
view was heretical, and hold to it obstinately, and it be formal without ever
being denounced by ecclesial authority.  
  
So I accept that in principle the ecclesiastical crime of heresy and formal
heresy are different. BUT, it seems to me that where a person does not take
his view to be heretical, they basically conflate. The debate then would be
whether a judgment by an authority is needed for us to discern whether or not
they had sufficient basis to know the view was heretical. I THINK this might
be where you and I disagree.  
  
I would certainly acknowledge that one COULD be aware, in reality, that his
view was heretical without such a judgment. But could anyone outside of the
person himself sufficiently discern that? That is the question. My view would
be that the only way we could know this definitively is if a judgment was made
against the person, and he remained in his error.  
  
And I think this then applies to the case of Honorius (BTW, elsewhere I noted
Erick's point that there is the additional issue of no council having declared
on monothelitism yet at the time of Honorius' letter, an additional wrinkle).
I did state in places that I realize Feser was not addressing as such the
distinction between formal and material heresy. I raise it to point out that
in principle one could be anathematized on material heresy alone where that
was not a clear understanding of this distinction, but such an anathema in
retrospect is problematic. So that would prompt a further discussion as to
given that the Church never later teaches anything not already implicitly
supported by the defined deposit of faith, we must presume that those
condemning Honorius would in fact be aware of something like material and
formal heresy distinction, and still condemned him anyway.  
  
My contention would be that we should not take their condemnation as proof
that a pope could be guilty of teaching something sufficiently close to formal
heresy, as I THINK you are suggesting. Rather, I would be inclined to do the
reverse. Given that what the Church herself now implies (as I take it) about
the relationship between formal heresy and the ecclesiastical crime of heresy
(in cases where the person does not consider his view heretical), we can see
that cases such as Honorius' prompted the need to develop the formal/material
distinction more clearly. I think it is also fair to say that over time the
Church has come to be procedurally more rigorous in understanding teachings to
be DEFINITIVE only when formally pronounced in councils or ex catheda, even if
we can contend that there can be infallible doctrine not so explicitly
defined. But the ability to judge a person in relation to what they hold in
such doctrines does in fact seem to differ when certain distinction and
juridical procedures are more defined than they appear to have been in the
time of Honorius' condemnation.",3344
"Isn't there a danger of circularity here? We know a Pope is teaching correctly
because he is teaching in line with tradition, as long as he is not teaching

conformity to tradition.",328

"This is why Chapman draws the conclusion: “Unquestionably no Catholic has the
right to deny that Honorius was a heretic… a heretic in words if not in

Some have tried to show how Honorius’s words can be read in an orthodox way,
but as Chapman and Butler emphasize, this misses the point that the question
of whether Honorius was a heretic cannot be settled by reference to his
letters alone. The fact that _councils and later_ _popes themselves_ have
denounced him as a heretic is also crucial, for to deny that he was a heretic
is thereby to challenge the judgment of these councils and popes. To show that
Honorius did not err, but at the cost of showing that these later popes and
(papally approved) councils _did_ err, would be a Pyrrhic victory.",824

"Well done. You, and I believe someone else, touch on another point I wanted to
make but already had a four part reply. :) As you say, there had not yet at
the time of Honorious been a formal declaration against monotheletism, so one
could not be accused of knowingly opposing a formally established doctrine of
the faith. At most, one could say he erred in failing to make an allegedly
obvious deduction from Chalcedon (all arguable), but that it seems to me would
still just rise to the level of material heresy, because presumably the
failure to make such a deduction would not in itself evidence obstinancy in
error. And, to be a formal error, there would have to be, I think, a formal
declaration of what is to be believed. So I think we are back to (among other
things) the question of whether it even makes sense to accuse a deceased
person of formal heresy (which Feser has not done I realize), unless perhaps
we can explicitly find a place where this person acknowledged he knew his view
was heretical and did not care, etc.  
  
It is also fair to say, I think, that these current insights would prevent
such declarations against Honorius today. And we might have raise, as i have
previously, where future popes could amend the non doctrinal juridical
condemnations of earlier councils, but I would have to know more about the
status of such statement relative to the establishment of tradition to venture
a confident answer on that point. But I am inclined, very tentatively, to say
since judgments are not infallible (even if they are at least authoritative AT
THE TIME they are given) that they could be corrected later--though of course
those corrections themselves could also be the same measure also be reviewed
later, and so on. I suspect we could find concrete cases in Church history,

""He doesn't ""want"" 127 to be a prime and 128 to be a power of 2. They are
those things per se.""  
  
They are these things for either one of two reasons.  
  
First, they are so because of a system of axioms with rules of inference that
allows us to prove it as a conclusion of a formal argument. This method of
proof is not necessarily connected with the world we measure and physically
inhabit. For example, without the infinite parallel postulate the axioms can
have added to them an intrinsic curvature in which by locally parallel
transport a circle can be constructed whose area is a rational multiple of its
radius and this circle can definitely be squared.  
  
So much for ""per se"" or human fiat. I don't even have to invoke the God beyond
human understanding to get that.  
  
The second method is by measuring the physical world we inhabit and building
up a finite mathematics which cannot be fudged up by arbitrarily adding axioms
which have not been physically proven themselves.  
  
Well it is just God's choice (will) that the local physics supports your
system. We can examine what God *can* do by examining what a model of God
allows, but we cannot examine what God *cannot* do this way because God is
greater than a model of God (a picture of you can show your hair color but it
can't jump or walk - but you can jump or walk and jump because you are not
limited by what the picture cannot do) . If you conclude from a model that God
cannot do something, you have only proved that it can't be done in the model -
which is not God.  
  
A good physical model of God is a computer with a program. A computer program
exists in which any circle, measured in the program, is exactly 6 times its
radius. This can be illustrated as a virtual reality in which virtual actors
measure virtual circles and always get that result. It can be shown as a

of God. If it can be made logical (in the measuring sense, the second method
of proof, in which axioms are experimentally determined as described above) on
a computer, then God can make it logical in physical reality, which, of
course, would be a different physical reality then the one we have come to
know and love.  
  
Similarly, God is not limited to creating a physical universe where 127 is

truth as it is known to you from living in this universe, but emotion doesn't

That you cannot, in your mind, know who is right does not mean that there is
no truth or that no one can enunciate it on a particular matter. That 15
people give different accounts of some event does not mean that none of the
accounts are correct. If you drive from Topeka to Billings and two witnesses
disagree on what you had for lunch, that does not mean that neither of them
were correct. You had a tuna and marshmallow sandwich. One witness said you

"The Monothelite heresy arose as a sequel to the Monophysite heresy. Orthodox
Christology holds that Christ is one Person with two natures, divine and
human. Monophysitism holds that Christ has only _one_ nature, the divine one.
Monothelitism can be understood as an attempt to find a middle ground position
between Monophysitism and orthodoxy. It holds that while there are two natures
in Christ, there is only one _will_. From the point of view of orthodoxy, this
is unacceptable, for one’s will is an integral part of one’s nature. Hence to
deny the reality of two wills in Christ is implicitly to deny that he has two
natures. (I’m aware that the dispute over these heresies is more complicated

"As a brief follow up, Tony, I THINK your point is that their anathemas show
that Honorius had sufficient basis to know his view was heretical, to where we
in retrospect can say that he was guilty of something sufficiently close to
what we today would call formal heresy. I would say the anathemas show that
his condemners thought he was sufficiently guilty of BLAMEWORTHY heresy, but
in time the distinction between formal and material, and its relation to
ecclesiastical crime of heresy, needed to be developed in order to assess
cases like Honorius' more effectively, the result being that such a
condmenation today would not be tenable. (Though his teaching could still be
criticized in juridical decisions, etc.). And this would prompt the follow up
issue of whether juridical declarations of councils are subject to later
revision, etc.--I don't have a firm stance on that, though I suspect it would
be possible, at least in terms of adding various clarifications and
disclaimers, etc. in light of more recent developments--i.e. not necessarily
completing negating the acts against Honorius, but mitigating them, or

""It does in math""  
  
Even in math, truth never corresponds with popularity because math depends on
the logic under which it is developed and even humans can develop a logic
under which what is true in one system is false under another. Under what
authority do you ban the rule of inference ""(A is true implies that A is
false)""? If every mathematician in the world called such a rule lunacy, that
would not be sufficient to ban it. Lunacy is not even a mathematical concept.  
  
This proffered rule of inference is perhaps the logic of some rock. Since
everything is false under its logic, it wills nothing, hence does nothing of
its own will. Conventionally we say a rock does not have a will.  
  
:-)  
  
A lunatic has a logic somewhat damaged (by convention) but still closer to
normal. He can will himself (usually) to put food into his mouth and even raid
the fridge, and even if his neurons are so destroyed that he can't do that,
his body will digest the food under its own degraded logic. Of course he could
be dying, but that is to be undergoing a change of state to something that is
no longer human (lacking a will).  
  
Mathematics just is not objective, somehow outside of creation. It is what God
wants it to be. Furthermore, God is beyond our understanding. If He wants it
to be possible to square a circle, he can make it so and we have only human
arguments against it using the logic that God willed us to normally have,
rather than another.

"Indeed, Chapman was writing during the pontificate of Pope St. Pius X, the
great foe of modernism and upholder of the authority of the papacy. In fact,
part of the point of Chapman’s book itself was precisely to uphold that
authority, and in particular to defend the Council’s teaching on papal
infallibility. And yet for all that, Chapman does not shrink from the judgment
that the historical facts show that “no Catholic has the right to deny that
Honorius was a heretic” (p. 116). The reason he could say this is that the
error Honorius was guilty of did not occur in the context of an _ex cathedra_
definition. And thus Chapman’s judgement is perfectly within the bounds of
what everyone acknowledged to be the orthodox understanding of the papacy even
in Pius X’s day.",773
"To be sure, there have over the centuries nevertheless been those who have
tried to defend Honorius, the most eminent being St. Robert Bellarmine (in
Book 4, Chapter XI of _On the Sovereign Pontiff_ ). But his arguments are
weak, and were rejected by later orthodox Catholic theologians. For example,
Bellarmine proposes that “perhaps” Honorius’s letter to Sergius was faked by
the heretics, though he also argues that if this theory is rejected, the
letter can be given an orthodox reading. But these strategies obviously
conflict with one another. If the problematic parts of the letter were faked
by heretics precisely for the purpose of spreading their heresy, then how can
they plausibly be given an orthodox reading? Or if these parts of the letter
are in fact orthodox, how can it plausibly be maintained that they were faked?
Wouldn’t heretics forging a letter have put into it statements that clearly
supported their position?",935
"Dr. Feser, respectfully, you make a clear error here. The council being wrong
about Honorious being a heretic would be an error in a judgment of historical
fact, not a matter of faith and morals. The matter of faith and morals would
be the judgment of monothelitism as heresy, which is entirely true and
accurate; whether or not Honorious was a heretic is a matter of historical
fact and judgment, and the Council is not and never has been stated to be
protected on questions of that kind. You claim that judging Honorious to be a
heretic is a matter of faith and morals, but this is wrong; the matter of
faith and morals is the condemnation of the *teaching* as heresy. If a
judgment of an individual as a heretic was protected infallibly,
excommunications could not be lifted years after someone's death, yet this
happens all the time.  
  
If Honorious was using his authority as the Pope to teach - and I disagree
that writing anything in a private letter rises to such authority, as when the
Pope attempts to teach something to the universal church he addresses the
Church directly - then Honorious cannot teach heresy. The reason is that we
are obliged to give religious assent of will to anything a Pope teaches from
the ordinary magisterium, and the Magisterium cannot bind us to sin.  
  
Honorious was *possibly* a heretic by the standards the Councils were using at
the time but absolutely *not* a heretic by the standards we use to judge
heresy today, as monothelitism had not yet been definitively judged as false
by the Church. If we were to call him a heretic in the way that Vatican I
understands the term, we'd also have to call St. Thomas Aquinas a heretic for
rejecting the Immaculate Conception.  
  
So I disagree with your argument here. The Magisterium cannot teach heresy as
understood by Vatican I's definitions of teach, heresy, and Magisterium, and
Honorious did no such thing.",1904
"(continued from previous 2 posts)  
  
With this in mind, take the question now to the issue of future Popes making
judgments about the views of previous popes. As Vatican I notes, we might ask
if a future Pope could override the judgment of a previous Pope as to whether
that previous view was indeed heretical or not. Indeed, this might even hold
to the previous Pope's own views. BUT, it is still hard to see how one could
judge that the previous pope was FORMALLY heretical, since he presumably would
not have taken his own view to be heretical. Could a future pope judge that a
previous pope really did know his view to be heretical, etc.?  
  
This raises some very thorny issues indeed. It seems to me that this could not
occur because as I understand it, part of the process of declaring someone a
formal heretic is that the person is confronted by the authority with a
judgment of heresy, and obstinately persists in his views. Obviously, this
cannot happen for someone who is deceased.  
  
Another difficulty of course is that if we say future popes can override the
judgment of prior popes, then we would also have to hold that an even later
pope could override THAT judgment, and so on. BUT, given that we hold that
Popes are bound by magisterial teaching, one might ask how this could happen.
Or, are popes bound only by magisterial teaching, and not by all previous
magisterial juridical decisions, etc.? If we hold that juridical judgments are
not infallible (even if they are authoritative in their time), then it seems
one could, in theory, later remove the anathemas of Honorius, or whatever. (It
certainly seems in other cases a future pope could override earlier papal
juridical decisions--e.g., we can conceive of a person excommunicated being
reinstated in the church by a future pope, and so on--does this change when
the decisions are concretized in conciliar declarations, etc.? Important
questions--to be continued, one final segment....).  
  ",1971
"It seems to me that before Vatican I, the Church was well aware of the matter
of teachings that were binding _in some strong sense_ even without a dogmatic
decree by a Council. One of the indicators of this is, expressly, the Church's
willingness to categorize someone as ""a heretic"" (and not just condemn their
teaching) on the basis of not merely that their idea is erroneous, but that
_they should have KNOWN better_ , and thus their holding such ideas is
_morally_ faulty as well as intellectually faulty. Certainly, the fact that
something had been already _taught universally by the Fathers_ was considered
sufficient evidence of its bona fides, without either a council or a papal
declaration, and indeed its unanimous affirmation by the Fathers _was USED by
the Councils_ as the basis for their dogmatic definitions. But at the same
time, there were many other teachings that were neither dogmatically defined,
nor contested / disputed, that were simply _passed along_ from generation to
generation as being ""what had been taught"" and everybody assented to them and
nobody got worked up about whether they were held definitively and
irreformably or just, you know, the ordinary teachings of the Church.  
  
The distinction between teachings that have been affirmed by the Church in a
way that demands assent without reservation, and teachings that have been
affirmed in a way that requires assent that can still be with reservation, has
been _implicitly_ present from the beginning. People had been implicitly using
that implicit distinction all along.",1561

"Hi Norm,  
Much respect to you, and while I agree that you could take Dr. Feser's ending
in that way, before I read your post I took it as meaning that the Church's
apostolic and papal offices would continue to be guided by the Holy Spirit,
both in teaching truth and in refuting heretics, be they popes or no.  
Additionally, I disagree that it is not healthy to desire other's punishment.
Obviously, bloodthirstiness (of a physical or spiritual nature) is incorrect,
the desire to have punishment where perhaps a lighter sentence would do, but
that is merely one end of the bookends of virtue. Justice may require such
harsh punishments, but it may not necessarily. C.S. Lewis wrote on this in his
book ""Mere Christianity,"" with the example of a man who cheats and lies his
way through life without any consideration for others' welfare, and he
challenges the reader not to have a desire that the flag should be planted in
that rebellious soul, which is just a healthy manifestation of justice. I'm
not trying to equate Honorius to that, only to show that a desire for justice
and retributive punishment isn't in itself a wrong, even if the judgment is
harsh, and I think that you would agree that misleading souls from salvation
is a particularly heinous crime. I don't think Dr. Feser is trying to make a
slight against Pope Francis either, for that matter.",1361

His Love Are Maintained Even in Death  
  
""The very heart of the faith has been lost to anyone who supposes that it is
only worthwhile, if it is, so to say, made worthwhile by the damnation of
others. Such a way of thinking, which finds the punishment of other people
necessary, springs from not having inwardly accepted the faith; from loving
only oneself and not God the Creator, to whom his creatures belong. That way
of thinking would be like the attitude of those people who could not bear the
workers who came last being paid a denarius like the rest; like the attitude
of people who feel properly rewarded only if others have received less. This
would be the attitude of the son who stayed at home, who could not bear the
reconciling kindness of his father. It would be a hardening of our hearts, in
which it would become clear that we were only looking out for ourselves and
not looking for God; in which it would be clear that we did not love our
faith, but merely bore it like a burden.""  
  
End quote  
  
To forestall some usual tired objections, obviously this doesn't deny the
reality of hell or the reality that some human beings will go to hell or the
reality of punishment. These Truths are obvious from Christ's clear words
where he says ""Many will not be Able"". (Although on the question of relative
numbers and percentages, I am inclined to agree with Cardinal Avery Dulles
where he mentioned that God hasn't provided any such stats or figures like
more then 50% etc. Those who interpret the narrow path and wide path in that
way are free to do so but other interpretations such as taking it to be a
practical warning and not as a prediction are legitimate opinions, The
pratical warning interpretation is taken by Pope Benedict XVI in ""God and The
World "" under the question ""Two Roads"". As in the Book of Revelations, John
mentioned he saw an innumerable crowd of people.)  
  
  
The main point I am trying to make here is that, looking forward to people's
punishments isn't healthy and shouldn't be encouraged. You shouldn't comfort
people who is faith has been shaken by ambiguous statements by saying ""don't
worry, those who made those statements will be brutally punishment"".

"@Ed Feser  
  
So why believe Chapman over Bellarmine?  
  
Seems the problem is the term ""heresy"" has undergone a development over the
past 2000 years. The Greek term literally means to break off from the whole.
In it's early use simply not following the discipline of the Church made you a
heretic (where as in later times we would call you a mere schismatic). Thought
in later times it is narrowly defined to refer to professing a false &
formally condemned doctrinal proposition.  
  
Allowing heresy to be taught or failing to condemn it can get you labelled a
""heretic"" even if you do not hold to any formal doctrinal or moral errors.  
  
Also I think condemning anybody as a heretic is an act of discipline not faith
and morals. I don't think the Catholic Church has the power to infallibly say
Nestorius was a heretic. But she can infallibly say Nestorianism (the false
view Christ is two persons, one divine and one human attributed to Nestorius)
is heresy.  
  
Which is why you can in theory rehabilitate a heretic. You don't know their
subjective intent with any certainty. But you can know a given doctrinal
proposition is false when the Church has clearly condemned it.

"The [Third Council of
Constantinople](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3813.htm) (680-681 A.D.,
also known as the Sixth Ecumenical Council recognized as authoritative by the
Catholic Church) was called to deal with the crisis. It condemned the exchange
between Sergius and Honorius very harshly, stating:",305
"The famous paragraph slipped into the Fourth Council of Constantinople’s
deliberations had more to do with the inflamed politics of the East than the
wrongs of Pope Honorius. The Lateran Council of 649, rejecting Monothelitism,
had blamed the orientals, making no mention of Pope Honorius. Pope Agatho got
his legates to bring to the Council of Constantinople a letter in which he
stated: “From the day when the leaders of the Church of Constantinople tried
to introduce heretical novelties in the immaculate Church of Christ, my
predecessors never ceased to exhort them… that they had to abstain… [from
proclaiming the error concerning the single will etc.]”.  
  
The Council’s machinations contradicted Pope Agatho and resulted in a wording
that was modified by Pope Leo II (upon receiving notice of its deliberations)
when he ratified it. This was the version he then sent to Constantinople and
all the bishops of the West. Pope Leo, in his explanation of the affair to the
bishops of Spain, clearly distinguished between the list of heretics named by
the Council, and Pope Honorius, censured for being negligent.  
  
  
In a long article in the Dictionnaire de theolgie catholique (1931, the DTC
was in another league entirely from the estimable Catholic Encyclopedia), Fr.
E. Amann, professor of theology at Strasbourg, concludes: “For us, the two
letters of Pope Honorius represent a doctrinal intervention of the Roman
pontiff in a debated question: referring to previous decisions, without adding
anything new to them except in manner, the pope teaches the theory of the two
natures, each operating according to what is proper to it, and demands entire
acceptance of this doctrine. Alongside this doctrinal teaching is a very
unfortunate prescription on the silence to be kept relative to the formulas in
dispute, ‘one or two energies’”.  
  
He concludes that “… [Honorius’] thought carries greater weight than the
formulas by which he expresses it, that these formulas themselves can with the
greatest rigor uphold an interpretation which does not deviate too much from
official orthodoxy. But to conclude from this, as many theologians have done,
the perfect orthodoxy of the two letters of Honorius, there is, it seems, some
distance.”  
  
Had the Council made a dangerous mistake? “It would certainly have done so if,
taking the question from an exclusively dogmatic point of view, it had passed
a doctrinal and pointless judgment on the very teaching of Honorius….[because
Honorius was basically orthodox, despite his expressions in these letters] the
assembly set itself up as judge much less of a theology than of a type of
conduct and those who engaged in it”.  
  
The weak arguments made by some theologians mentioned in the post do not
devalue their stronger ones – which don’t get a proper mention; the question
of the Pope losing the faith, the issue of formal heresy dealt with by
Bellarmine, surely deserves some explanation. As far as the history goes, Pope
Honorius was NOT a heretic, and Fr. Chapman’s 100 page work does not establish
it.  
  
I think there is a distinction between ex cathedra infallibility (which
permits no stain of error) and the foibles of Popes at other times which,
however much destruction they cause, does not translate into meaning they can
lose the faith. Obviously we aren’t expected to believe that off the cuff
“magisterium” on planes is not free from tendentiousness to the point of
destructive favouring of whatever error is in fashion. That the man doing this
will not lose the faith, ever, is in line with what Vatican One defined
concerning the Faith of the See of Rome that would not fail until the end of
time. Reducing this to the extraction of ex cathedra statements one a century
from men who could otherwise have no faith, or renounce Christ, seems more
like the speech of Balaam’s ass.  ",3860

""Sure, but you are absolutely not infallible about_THAT_, etc, etc, etc ad
infinitum.  
  
Humans are going to talk about things anyway. If you are going to try to block
these things by saying ""not infallible"", why not say nothing because you are
not infallible either.  
  
Sheesh!  
  
:-)  
  
""But can he create a physical universe containing 127 and 128 in which the
former is not prime and the latter is not a power of 2?""  
  
Yes.  
  
Every created thing is an image of God even though the created thing may not
seem like God at all. We say that the image exists pre-eminently in God. So if
one says a house is like the architect who designed it, we say that the house
exists pre-eminently as an image in the mind of the architect, and he creates
his observable plan drawings from the unobservable image in his mind and the
house is built from these drawings by his agent, the carpenter. So the house
is an image of the architect. This is straight out of Aquinas.  
  
In the same way, I can specify a model, or image, of God. The model exists
pre-eminently in God and is like Him, even though it is just me who specifies
the model. God is not limited by the limitations of the model, but what can be
shown in the model exists pre-eminently in God.  
  
The model, or likeness, is an infinite unbiased binary sequence of 50/50 bits.
All finite subsequences exist within this infinite sequence. If the
consecutive binary digits are each 50/50, then the infinite sequence is a
normal sequence. Even so, any subsequence of specified finite length could be
missing a particular sub-sub-sequence of itself because such a subsequence
itself must appear normally within the infinite sequence. Therefore, discovery
by bitwise examination of a subsequence of finite length, no matter how long,
that misses a particular sub-sub-sequence cannot be a demonstration that the
infinite sequence is not normal.  
  
A description of finite space and time is encoded by a finite subsequence of
the infinite normal sequence. A computer that can run the subsequence as a
program, including memory, could virtually reproduce all that we experience of
reality, given the finite resolution of our senses in time and space. We would
not be able to tell whether a missing sub-sub-sequence would exist further
along in time in which the rules of arithmetic are no longer what they were.
Since the infinite sequence is of random bits, the rules of arithmetic really
are not rules. They have just appeared to be rules by random chance. The
model, as explained, does not specify God or God's will. So we cannot say from
the model whether God could change what appeared to be rules of arithmetic
into completely different rules where 128 is not a power of 2 and 127 is a
composite number.

"The trouble for Pope Honorius began when Sergius, patriarch of Constantinople,
wrote to him on the topic of Christ’s will and proposed a compromise that
might appeal to disaffected Monophysites.  In his reply, Honorius affirmed
that it is better to avoid speaking of either “one or two operations” in
Christ, and even affirmed a sense in which there is “one will” in Christ. The
problem is that the first claim seems to leave wiggle room for Monothelitism,
and the second seems positively to affirm it.",502
"A pope is said to speak _ex cathedra_ or “from the chair” when he solemnly
puts forward some teaching in a manner intended to be definitive and
absolutely binding. This is also known as an exercise of the pope’s
_extraordinary magisterium_ , and its point is to settle once and for all
disputed matters concerning faith or morals. The First Vatican Council taught
that such _ex cathedra_ doctrinal definitions are infallible and thus
irreformable. The _ordinary magisterium_ of the Church too (whether in the
person of the pope or some other bishop or body of bishops) can sometimes
teach infallibly, when it simply reiterates some doctrine that has always and
everywhere been taught.",684

sheep back to safety with the flock.  
  
Professor Feser wrote an extensive analysis of the parallel duty of the
theologian where such pastoral care is insufficient, this parallel duty
sometimes going so far as to criticize publicly. It is taken mostly from the

Monothelite heretics, Mann says that “it seems, however, more likely that they
did” condemn him in the same manner, and that “it cannot… be denied that it is
more natural to assume that all those condemned by the council were all
condemned in the same sense” (p. 343). Mann also notes, as Chapman does, that

"(final segment--see previous 3 posts from me)  
  
So, taking all of these points together, we are left to wonder if anyone can
be declared FORMALLY heretical posthumously (at least in a case where there is
no evidence they were judged heretical and obstinately persisted in their
views). This then raises the question as to whether one can, and/or should, be
anathematized posthumously at all. This has obviously occurred, presumably
also in cases other than that of Honorius, so it certainly can happen. BUT,
what we do not have in Honorius's case is a judgment that he was FORMALLY
heretical (a distinction I suspect was not fully formulated or conceived at
the time of Council condemning him). And once this distinction between formal
and material heresy is made, we must face more squarely whether it is
appropriate, or even possible, to condemn someone who is not formally
heretical (as it seems Honorius could not have been). Prior to this
distinction being made, we can likely forgive such anathemas, but it seems
this distinction now affects how such judgments can be made (and perhaps even
how we assess anathemas given before the material/formal distinction was fully
developed).  
  
In any case, we see that it was only a future pope and council who passed
these judgments about a previous pope. At the very least, this should give
great pause to anyone not in such authority to presume too definitely that
anything a current or previous pope did was heretical. But this is especially
true if one goes down the path of implying formal heresy, as for a current
pope that would ultimately require the judgment of the Pope himself, and would
be questionable if even a current Pope could do that in respect to a previous
Pope (see above). I realize Feser is not arguing otherwise, but I suspect some
who read this might apply what he says to current situations and neglect to
appreciate the limits the points I raise place on such assessments. (And, we
might add, such people could never have it seems even more than an opinion,
though perhaps a well informed one, that a current pope held even a materially
heretical view, since the judgment of heresy would ultimately fall to the Pope
himself).  
  
All this said, to reiterate a previous key point, in respect to Honorius, we
can ask whether the current distinction between formal and material heresy
would preclude anathemas like those against Honorius from taking place today.
And, we may even ask whether the authority of a current pope would permit
qualifying, or perhaps even removing, the judgment against Honorius in later
councils, depending upon the extent to which one determines juridical
declarations of councils (bearing in mind juridical decisions do not seem to
be infallible, even if in their time they are authoritative), are or are not
components of magisterial tradition which oblige agreement with current
judgments, papal or otherwise.

dreams the future Church will rehabilitate Archbishop Lefebvre and make him a

am proven wrong in the future then the Church calling Honorius a heretic is a
fallible act of discipline(like it was with calling Lefebvre a schismatic

a reflection of bad will or malice and the act of mocking such positions gives
them the opportunity to reject the absurd position in order that they

"@Infinite Growth (continued)  
  
The area that we have to be most careful in is in judging particular
intentions associated with a particular act. It is here that judgements are
most unsure. Now, we also have to be careful not to completely de-link
intentions from the exterior act. (This is a problem that occurred in 20th
century Catholic theology. On this point, see Matthew Levering's recent book
The Abuse of Conscience). The act is intended by the person and if the act is
bad then the intention is bad in some way. However, the person again may be
acting from ignorance or confusion or trying to achieve some real good and yet
be going about it in the wrong way. In this instance, you can again explain
moral principles and why a particular act is not good and this should help to
guide their intentions in the future as they realize, for example, that a good
end does not justify a bad means. etc.  
  
However some people are in fact habitually bad. That is, they have bad
character. In this instance another work of mercy is called for: Rebuking the
sinner.  
  
Regarding your suggestion that our only enemy is the principalities, this also
is based on a partial reading of St. Paul. St. Paul also identifies the flesh
as our enemy in Galatians 5:19ff, ""Now the deeds of the flesh (Greek: sarx)
are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery,
enmities, strife, jealousy, etc..."" He warns that those who practice these
things will not inherit the kingdom of God. Flesh is used in multiple and
analogous ways in the NT and can be used to simply refer to the body, but here
it refers to sinful desires, intentions and acts. So the flesh, in this sense,
is also an enemy of the Christian according to Paul.  
  
If we take a broader focus on the New Testament, we also find that ""the world""
(Greek: kosmos) is also an enemy of the Christian and this is reflected in the
writings of St. John. Kosmos is also used in multiple senses in the NT so this
does not entail that each use refers to something bad. However, a worldly
spirit that says ""Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die"" (i.e. ""this
world is all there is""; hence worldliness) is contrary to authentic faith and
is another enemy of the Christian.  
  
It is for this reason that the council of Trent identified three enemies of
the Catholic viator: Satan, the world, and the flesh. So, the suggestion that
we have only one enemy is based on a partial consideration of the New
Testament at the exclusion of other parts.",2520
" **But the same sorts of thing occur in reverse,** when you judge and evil man
to be innocent: in respect of the **mere judgment itself** neither harm nor
benefit befalls anyone else, including him. But as soon as you act on the
judgment by according him trust as if he were innocent, when he is guilty, you
harm _whatever project hinged_ on according him that trust. This usually means
harm to yourself (because, usually, you will be a participant in that
project), or it COULD be many other people besides yourself. You therefore are
**JUST AS LIKELY** to harm yourself and others in this way as in the first
case above. The two are entirely analogous.  
  
To look at it from a non-personal perspective: in a court of criminal law,
regarding penalties that the law might impose, the judge (or jury) applies a
standard of ""innocent until proven guilty"" and a standard of needing guilt to
be established ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". But in a civil suit, the judge
applies a DIFFERENT STANDARD: the award of damages or benefits is based on a
mere _preponderance of the evidence""_ , i.e. wherever the stronger argument
lies, there is where the judgment lies. And the judge MUST render a judgment
that will be to the detriment (i.e. ""harm"") one of the two parties. Therefore,
he must harm one and benefit the other on the basis of merely _whichever is
one more probably in the right (has the better argument)_ , he cannot choose
to opt out of judging.  
  
Here's the thing: The ""court of public opinion"" and personal judgments are
similar to each other in this - that they are RIGHTLY not restricted to
bringing conclusions only with evidence showing ""beyond a reasonable doubt"".
They both RIGHTLY make judgments based (at least much closer to) on a mere
_preponderance of the evidence_ , OR EVEN LESS! And this applies to the vast,
vast array of social and civic decisions we must make: I choose not to enter
into a repair contract with this roofing contractor because ""he felt slimy to
me"", and nothing more specific than that, is a **perfectly appropriate**
judgment to make. I don't even have to be judging him to be ""slimy"" as being
""more likely than not"" (i.e. above 50%), it would be sufficient for me to do
it based on a lower scale, like 20% or 30% likelihood, because I can go find
another contractor whom I estimate is far less likely to be slimy, perhaps
""less than 5%"". Thus I ""harm"" the first contractor based on a very modest
basis of evidence, and do so with complete legitimacy.  
  
You might recast this judgment as being not ""he IS slimy"" but rather ""there is
a 30% probability he is slimy"", but that doesn't prevent (a) that you made a
negative judgment and a negative CHOICE affecting him, and (b) your choice
does him harm (in some sense). So recasting it that way still causes the
judgment to fall under St. Thomas's stated opprobrium, even though it is
manifestly a right kind of judging.  
  
The only way to repair the argument Thomas gives is to reframe it as: it is
wrong to make FIRMER judgments (against) someone than the evidence (you have)
allows for. And the certain wrongness here lies **primarily in its defiance to
the virtues of truth** , and not ""harm to the person.” The virtues of truth
(e.g. prudence) would have you make DUE judgments that the evidence allows
for, and WITHHOLD from firmer opinions than the evidence allows, and when you
violate that, you _harm yourself_ first, before harming some other. Due
judgments may well rely on less-than-solid evidence, if they are less-than-
solid _judgments_ (i.e. when they are held as opinions). Withholding from
making judgments on incomplete evidence is ALSO a failure of prudence, when a
judgment is needed regardless of the state of the evidence. Commanders in
battle must often make judgments of the enemies tactical object when the
evidence is far from solid, they cannot just wait until they have proof or
even something close to it.",3929

"I have a bone to pick with the reasoning given here:  
  
_And again, “we ought, in this kind of judgment, to aim at judging a man good,
unless there is evident proof of the contrary.” To be sure, we might
frequently be misled as a result. However, argues Aquinas, this is preferable
to the outcome that would follow if we did not give others a presumption of
innocence:  
  
 **He who interprets doubtful matters for the best, may happen to be deceived
more often than not; yet it is better to err frequently through thinking well
of a wicked man, than to err less frequently through having an evil opinion of
a good man, because in the latter case an injury is inflicted, but not in the
former.**_  
  
I suggest: _On the contrary:  
  
“Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all
kinds of evil against you because of Me. (Matt 5:13  
  
…and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered,
those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame. (1 Peter
3:16)  
  
If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit
of glory and of God rests on you. (1 Peter 4:14)  
  
No weapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every tongue
that accuses you.  
This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and this is their
vindication from me,” declares the Lord. (Isaiah 54:17)  
  
For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me,  
speaking against me with lying tongues. (Ps. 109:2)  
But thou, O God my Lord,  
deal on my behalf for thy name's sake;  
because thy steadfast love is good, deliver me! (Ps. 109:21)  
Help me. O Lord my God!  
Save me according to thy steadfast love!  
Let them know that this is thy hand;  
thou, O lord, hast done it!  
let them curse, but do thou bless! (Ps. 109:26-28) _  
  
So, arguably, the mere _thought <.i> against a man is not injury to him.  
  
I don't think it is easy to establish the last statement in ""in the latter
case, an injury is inflicted, but not in the former."" Let me suggest the
opposite: As often as you injure an innocent man when you judge him evil, just
as often so also you injure _yourself or others_ when you judge an evil man to
be innocent.  
  
To argue this: Let me distinguish: if you judge a man evil when he isn't, but
you do not ACT on this opinion in any way, you do not _actually_ injure the
man as such. **YOUR** thoughts don’t affect him directly, but only via some
further medium. So, the only actual injury he suffers is when you ACT on that
opinion. Now, perhaps the first action you might take is to declare your
judgment to others and this WOULD be harm to him (in some sense or other,
perhaps), but let's eliminate this: it clearly requires not your mere
judgment, but your ACT to tell others. The next most likely downstream
(harmful) event from that erroneous judgment is that you won't give him some
trust on some matter, and this withholding from trust does actually injure
him. Any actual harm requires a transfer from your _thought_ into some
secondary vehicle that goes outside yourself and impinges on him. UNTIL you
have an occasion (such as this withholding trust) to act on your erroneous
opinion, you have not actually injured him. However, there are high prospects
that there WILL be some such occasion, and so it is _very likely_ that you
will injure him. And perhaps this high likelihood is sufficient to say (as a
loose approximation) that you ""have"" harmed him in making the judgment. _",3511
"Another good rule of thumb is to consider, before posting some comment on
Twitter, Facebook, a blog, or wherever, how it will look at the Last Judgment,
when, Christ warns, “men will render account for every careless word they
utter; for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be
condemned” (Matthew 12:36-37, RSV).",340
"The first half of the book of Romans? Could you be any less specific? There is
not a single verse in Romans that states that we are more indebted to people
the more sinful they are. Again, this is something that came from your
(apparently) very active imagination. For that reason, you cannot state a
single verse that supports your conclusion and suggest that someone needs to
sift through half of Romans to try to discern where in the world you might
have committed eisogesis to arrive at your odd conclusion.  
  
In response to your suggestion that your opinion is found in Romans, I think
you should read the Pentateuch, the major and minor prophets, and the Wisdom
literature to discover that this opinion is not correct. While you are at it,
you should also read the Gospels, general epistles, Pauline Corpus, and
apocalyptic literature from both the OT and NT. Let's see, does that cover it.
Yes, I think that if you do that, you will see that I am correct.  
  
Regarding St. John Chyrsostom's sermon on the Blasphemy of the Holy Spirit:
Again, why don't you take the trouble to get specific rather than making broad
generalizations coupled with a glib confidence in your own unsupported
conclusions. If you have the slightest textual support for the assertion that
we are more indebted to greater sinners than we are to lesser sinners, why
don't you provide at least one little quote that says precisely that? We are
all on the edge of our seats. Otherwise, perhaps you should not place such
glib confidence in entirely baseless opinions. After all, a high level of
confidence coupled with a high level of ignorance is a fairly toxic
combination. Such folks have difficulty learning because they always presume
themselves to be the teacher even when their opinions are entirely unfounded

"@Uncommon Descent  
  
I don't think you have understood the account of charity given in this post.
Charity or love is to will the good of another person. This is the highest
call of the Christian and a fulfilment of the entire law. We are called to
love God above all things and to love our neighbor as ourselves. It is in this
that Christians reflect the image of God who is love itself. It is in this
that we show the Spirit of love dwelling within us as ""the love of God is
poured into [our] hearts through the Holy Spirit who is given to us"" (Rom
5:5). It is this love that causes us to obey Christ's commands as Jesus taught
""If you love me you will keep my commands"" (John 14:15). The significance of
this love for our salvation is that ""Christ is the source of eternal salvation
for those who obey Him"" Hebrews 5:9).  
  
This love is even greater than faith (1 Cor 13). Even with faith to move
mountains, without love we are nothing (1 Cor 13). It is this love that causes
our faith to work as what counts is ""faith working through love"" (Gal 5:6).  
  
Again, this is the entire law: to love God and to love neighbor as oneself.
Such love is reflected in the 10 commandments with the first 3 being about
loving God and the second 7 being about loving neighbor. It is for this reason
that Jesus responded to the rich young ruler's question (""what must I do to be
saved?"") by quoting the commandments and then calling him to an act of love
for the poor. It is for this reason that Jesus will separate the sheep and the
goats based on whether or not they cared for those without clothes, food, and
those imprisoned. We will be judged in the end on whether or not love dwells
within us. As God is love itself and this love it poured into our hearts
through the Holy Spirit, it is this love by which we ""remain in Christ"" as
branches remain in the vine. This occurs when we love even our enemies as
Christ calls us to do.  
  
This does not mean that we never correct our enemies or rebuke them. Rebuking
a sinner to stop sinning is an act of love. It is a work of mercy. So is
instructing those that are ignorant. The key point in the post above is that
we should not easily default into thinking that those who disagree with us are
malicious. Having that as a default approach is neither reasonable nor
charitable and given the centrality of both charity and truth in the Christian
life, such an approach is not a Christian approach to discourse.",2453

operations… the judgment of suspicion pertains directly to injustice when it
is betrayed by external action, and then it is a mortal sin.”",442

good law. And it is, to boot, good logic. As students of critical thinking are

given a more reasonable or less reasonable interpretation, we should presume
that the more reasonable one is what the speaker intended, unless we have
solid grounds for judging otherwise. This is in part a matter of basic
fairness to the other person. But it is also sound methodology. The point of
logic is not to win a debate, but to discover what is true. If we dismiss an
argument too quickly on the basis of an uncharitable interpretation, we might
miss some important truth we could have learned from it had we considered it

be a last resort, not the first, and in modern mass media people tend instead
to be too “quick on the trigger.” As Aquinas says, “when a man hates or

indications to think evil of him, because everyone easily believes what he
desires.” We like to think that the reason we dislike a person is that he has

@Infinite Growth:  
  
St. Paul did not forbid all judgement. If he did, he would not have written in
1 Corinthians 5:3, ""For I, on my part, thought absent in body but present in
spirit have already judged him who has so so committed this, as though I were
present.""  
  
St. Paul is referred to a man who is sleeping with his father's wife whom the
Corinthians have not rebuked out of a disordered tolerance that is so well
described in Feser's post above.  
  
Some of the distinctions in the post that are also found in St. Thomas are
helpful to determine in what conditions a judgement can be made without being
rash. One important distinction is between an exterior act (someone's actions
which we can see) and an interior act (an inward intention which only God can
see). You can judge an act and recognize that it is wrong without attributing
to the person malice. The person may be acting wrongly out of ignorance and
this is significantly less culpable than malice. In that instance, you could
approach someone calmly and explain to them why the exterior act was not
moral. This would be an act of mercy that the Church calls ""Instructing the
ignorant."" Again you can do this without assuming that the person is either
malicious or an imbecile. In fact, to instruct someone actually presumes
goodwill. It presumes that they care about the truth and that if you take the
time to explain the truth, that they will be inclined to follow it.  
  
So, we have to make distinctions about what being judged and this can help us
from making assumptions about intentions which we cannot be sure of without
knowing someone's character and habits. This does not prevent us from judging
the exterior acts of anyone even if we don't know them. Nor does it prevent us
from assessing their assertions even if we don't know them.  
  
It is also important to highlight that we can get to know someone's character
and can make judgement's on that. In this, we just have to be much more
careful and, again, err on the side of charity for their good and ours.
However, if someone habitually steals or commits adultery or lies, we don't
have to pretend that they have a good character when it is obvious that they
don't.

by far is that of rash judgment. Indeed, social media exchanges and political
discourse sometimes seem to consist in little more than rash judgment as
Aquinas characterizes it – that is, judgment about “the inward intention, or
other uncertain things” about another person, which “proceeds not from
benevolence but from bitterness of heart.” Opponents are routinely demonized,
condemned as wicked rather than merely wrong. Their claims and arguments are
not evaluated by way of a dispassionate consideration of evidence and logical
strength, but dismissed _a priori_ as stemming from bad motives. Policy
differences are attributed, not to sincere but mistaken opinions about what is
best for the country, but to cynical political calculation. The very idea that

evidence to make a certain judgment about the matter, _if_ our judgment tends
to be clouded by dislike of the person, and so on. But with some people, it is
possible dispassionately and objectively to judge from their patterns of
behavior over time that they are indeed acting from bad motives. There is no
sin in making such a judgment under such circumstances. On the contrary, a
habitual refusal to do so can be a vice. As [I have discussed

someone is a sinner (i.e. malicious but not ignorant; they know it is wrong
and don't really care). This entails that we are able to recognize and
distinguish malice and ignorance. I think learning to do this effectively is
critical for being able to effectively win people to the truth. If you rebuke
a sincerely mistaken person for their mistake, this is unnecessary. Such a
person just needs instruction. If you give instruction to a malicious person,
this is uneffective because they don't care at all about the truth. Such a
person doesn't need to be taught, he needs to be rebuked. This lies behind

I believe that our existence was purposely orchestrated by God and that
science cannot prove or disprove it, because randomness is far simpler than
anything science can attain to. Science tries to simplify and does simplify
prima facie discrete data, but the simplification into statements is as far as
it can go. A statement obviously has a specific order. It is not random and
cannot be further compressed and retain intelligibility. A random process
could have come up with the statement or, far more likely, gibberish.  
  
This is not in any way anti-scientific.  
  
To put it in terms, not of statements, but of the actual result in the
physical environment, the theory based on random mutation and natural
selection does not have in it a pointer to which of the almost unimaginably
large number of results today that it could have led to.  
  
Something with purpose chose the result by undetectably choosing the results
of the ""dice rolls"", the choices hidden in what is only random to human
intellect.

I cannot speak for Ed, but I was not arguing for or against natural selection
per se. I disentangle truth and natural selection, as science, through my idea
that, since a random sequence is a valid image of God, and since we know
through quantum mechanics that there is such a thing as a random sequence, a
random sequence, being without rules, is a very simple image of God, who also
is without rules.  
  
But God is greater than this or any other image, and is in no way limited by
this image. So questions about consciousness do not restrict this image. What
it is useful for, to we humans, is to show that we cannot calculate, with our
mathematical science, what God's acts will be or are, since we cannot
calculate a number (a sequence) whose digits are without a rule (are random),
and, since God is truth, this separates truth from natural selection. In
short, it is beyond our understanding (at least for me) to know whether
natural selection is actual science, although as a theory of science, as Ed
said in the video, (""natural selection favors fitness"") it explains adaption
to the environment of survivors.  
  
I can't see how your question can give a different answer without assumption,
so I can't see it as a real question because the answer is either beyond our
understanding, or follows from the arbitrary assumptions in its formulation. I

anything that smacks of the psychological – consciousness, intentionality, and
so on. (This is precisely why Descartes had to relocate consciousness out of
the material world and in a separate _res cogitans_ , as Chomsky himself
emphasizes later in the discussion with Goff and Frankish.) Hence an approach
that appeals to computational rules, given its essentially mechanistic
character, precisely _leaves out_ what is distinctive of the mental, and thus
cannot coherently claim to _account for_ the mental.",891

interpretation of this interrogative sentence on which it amounts to a real
question susceptible of an answer. For example, it might be interpreted as
asking why the world is such that _change_ occurs in it, rather than being
static in the way Parmenides and Zeno took it to be. And an answer would be
Aristotle’s view that substances have _potentialities_ as well as actualities,

cause of it, you haven't done anything to address the substance of the
philosophical arguments about why consciousness is so weird._  
  
Naturalists say that when brains reach a certain level of ""complexity"", they
become conscious (something ""emerges""). And what does that mean? That's just
the process of **eduction of the substantial form from the potentialities of
prime matter,** described by Aquinas 700+ years ago.  
  
That means that the forms (ADN) are in the potency of prime matter (chemicals)
and are then drawn out into act through the agency of the efficient cause (the
powers existing in the environment). Once you reach the ""threshold of
complexity"", the form appears and so do the new properties and powers, like
being self-conscious and being capable of abstract thinking.  
  
So naturalists have reached the same conclusion that St. Thomas did. But St.
Thomas had a coherent, hyper-extense, detailed up to the point of exhaustion
metaphysical system. They claim ""emergence"" but they can not offer an
explanation for it, that's why they hide under the cover of ""Natural
Selection"" and her wondrous powers. And that's too why they hide under the
cover of ""deep time"" as a last ditch effort to look credible. Naturalists,
those ""wondrous powers"" pertain to God and only to God.

"Hey, Tom!  
  
Thanks for answering me!  
  
""Even if you want to suggest that evolution is a good explanation for why we
have such a feature, that itself is a pretty bad explanation for the feature
itself.""  
  
I don't want to suggest that evolution is a good explanation for the
phenomena, I just asked what can we say in response to that - on a
philosophical level. Because these guys I quoted use some energy trying to
explain features, functions, etc. based on evolution and I wish to know how to
prove on philosophical grounds why appealing to that is wrong.  
  
In what follows, I will try to give some background.  
  
""In other words, how do you know that natural selection is blind, other than
by assuming it, in which case there is nothing that you can say? But there is
a lot of randomness in the environment in which natural selection operates.""  
  
I'm not advocating that it's blind or not. I was quoting Ed - if I get him
right anyway - on his answer to Ben Shapiro in this video
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FvYwpyFbIQ). You can see the specific
question that Ben is formulating at 39:57 and Ed's response in the following
minutes (but I would suggest that you watch the whole video).  
  
Now, back to Ed's response - again, if I get him correctly - he's not arguing
against Natural Selection blindness, he's saying Natural Selection could not
explain why the human mind is directed at truth (it is really important to
note that he's talking about TRUTH directness, not just any other feature in
the present case) and I agree with him (because just like he said, natural
selection explains fitness and passing genes). And it's important to note too
the fact that he was presupposing that it was true when he formulated the
argument - not because he may agree with it or not - but because its trueness
or not had nothing to do to the point that he was making (again, he said that
natural selection explains fitness, etc. and that's not related with the mind
directedness for truth per see).  
  
So, now that I made this background to avoid any misunderstandings what I'm
trying to ask is: could we make a similar answer disentangling body unity and
evolution or natural selection claims?  
  
I do not have any problem with evolution at all. I was just trying to say that
someone could conflate two problems (evolution on one side and unity and
substantial form on the other).  
  
For example: if someone says that our unity is caused by ""an evolutionary
process that co-opted our cells to do what they do now'' someone, plausibly,
may think that our unity is just an accidental one.  
  
Personally, I don't think that's true - I think that's insane - but some
people believe this. But I can't just say that that's insane - that would beg
the question. Instead, I would have to argue philosophically to show that. And
that's what I'm trying to say: these two problems i.e the unity substance's
(or we can think of its organs functions related to each other as one
indivisible unity) and natural selection or evolution could have nothing to do
with it each other - but they might seem at least to be related and someone
might argue something like the example I presented. That's why I'm asking Ed
if we could (or how to) disentangle the two (like in the same way when he was
explaining why truth per se has nothing to do with natural selection).",3372
"Interestingly, Chomsky himself does not take that view. Indeed, in his
exchange with Goff and Frankish, he suggests that the so-called hard problem
is really a pseudo-problem. He points out that the fact that we can form an
interrogative sentence does not by itself entail that it expresses a genuine
question. With some interrogatives, there may be no possible way to answer
them, and in that case, he says, we’re not dealing with a genuine question.",451
"Frankish replies by suggesting that the neural processes underlying
introspection can distort things just as much as those underlying perception
do. But as Chomsky goes on to point out, while _what consciousness tells us_
about this or that object or event is certainly fallible, it doesn’t follow
that the reality of consciousness _itself_ is an illusion. (Here’s an analogy
– mine, not Chomsky’s. Suppose I find that a certain person, Fred, is a
chronic liar. This gives me good reason to doubt the things Fred tells me. But
it hardly by itself gives me any reason to think that Fred _himself_ doesn’t
exist.)",611
"""Newtonian physics did not truly explain the phenomena with which it dealt,
but carried the day because it described them so well.""  
  
and  
  
""Occult""  
  
I know that you have made that point, or one just like it a number of times,
but it still produces a chuckle at a provoked classroom memory multitudes will
have shared.  
  
""Yeah, but WHAT is it? What is gravity? How does it operate? ""

maneuvering through his system whatever it happens to be, just stares blandly

Jacket's Manual"".  
  
Way back when, the US Navy at least admitted that although they knew how to
generate and use electricity, they did not quite know what it was. I suppose
we have come some distance since 1944. Though there's a guy on YouTube who is
arguing that electricity does not actually flow through the wiring that
transmits it. Has had some positive comments from people who purport to be
well educated in physics.  
  
I keep forgetting to ask my kid brother about that ...",1284
"Hey, Uncommon.  
  
If you have some time, check this
(https://naturalhistory.si.edu/education/teaching-resources/life-
science/early-life-earth-animal-origins). Now, this is an example of what I
have been trying to say.  
  
Leaving aside the fact that the text tried to implicitly assert the
plausibility of the mitochondria theory as a 'known fact' or true without
arguing - when it's in fact just a theory among others. Look what they say
about animals - especially multicellular ones. And besides the fact of the
'magical' conjoining of diverse cells or microorganisms inside microorganisms,
they are doing exactly as I said in the example.  
  
As I said, this sounds insane. But based on your comments and @Tom Cohoe - and
some things I read of Ed's work - I think we can say something about this.
First, even though this is all true and or cells and etc. we're co-opted by
'who knows why' to work together, the history is very different now than it
was long ago. Our ACTUAL existence is not like it was long ago. They say in
the text that the microorganisms that formed the mitochondria were separable
in principle - at least they suppose it is that way. In our actual existence,
we can't separate our parts and expect them to work ALONE or in the same way,
as it was long ago (again, supposing that they were right) because they are
organs - parts of substances - not substances in their own right.  
  
But one of the major problems I think that all of this has (and I'm basing
myself on somewhat the same analysis that Ed does when discussing atomism in
his Scholastic Metaphysics book) is when it comes to the first organism
because the first organism on earth necessarily had parts that work together -
and work for him. So, even if they say that our unity is an accidental one
(like atomists say), they can't get rid of substance (and prime matter) in the
first place (like atomists).  
  
What do you guys think? This argument could work?",1953
"But Descartes held, correctly in Chomsky’s view, that certain aspects of the
human mind could not be accounted for on this mechanical model. For this
reason he posited a separate principle to account for them, the _res cogitans_
or thinking substance, and Chomsky takes this to be a perfectly ordinary sort
of move to make in scientific investigation. (Not that Chomsky agrees with
Descartes. He is merely objecting to those who represent Descartes’ positing
of the _res cogitans_ as if it were suspect from a scientific point of view or
otherwise intellectually disreputable.)",577
"@ Tadeo:  
  
Sorry for the delay and thank you for your kind words! :) I have read the
article. Some comments:  
  
1\. You're right. Historical science is highly speculative. Lots of these
""theories"" are events which (purportedly) happened hundreds of millions of
years ago and which have left a very weak trace. It's very difficult for us
humans to do forensic science with things in the present and there's always
room for (sometimes) grave mistakes. So reconstruing things that happened this
long ago is an almost impossible task. Some evolutionary ""science"" consists
for example in people who find a tooth and then make a ""reconstruction"" of the
whole body plan of the animal, its environment and behavior. It's funny
especially coming from the side of the ""we can only believe what our senses
tell us"". It's an exercise in imagination most of the time. Our Saint knew a
great deal about the power of human imagination and its inner workings. But he
was intellectually superior to naturalists.",999
"Where the study of consciousness is concerned, recent philosophy of mind has
followed David Chalmers in distinguishing between “easy problems” and the
“hard problem.” Identifying the neural correlates of various kinds of
conscious awareness would be examples of an easy problem. By characterizing
such a problem as “easy,” Chalmers doesn’t mean that it is trivial, or even
easy in every respect. He just means that it is the sort of problem the
solution to which seems clearly attainable using existing methods and standard
scientific and philosophical assumptions. The “hard problem” is explaining why
any of the neural processes in question are associated with conscious
awareness, given that it seems at least prima facie possible that they could
do what neuroscience describes them as doing in the complete absence of
consciousness. (This is alleged to be shown by arguments like Chalmers’
[“zombie argument,”](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2013/12/zombies-
shoppers-guide.html) along with other influential arguments like Frank
Jackson’s [“knowledge

 _Honest question. When it comes to that general point that Chomsky, Nozick,
or even Dennett or Dawkins say about ""evolution [or in the case of Dawkins,
for example, Natural Selection] molded us that way and explains why we have
such features as X"" what can we say?_  
  
We can say that their assertions are not scientific. There's no way for us to
test this pseudo-explanation. Contra Gould, we can not replay the tape of
evolution (except in our imagination). We have to accept on faith what bottom
of the barrel ""thinkers"" like Mr. Dennett and Mr. Dawkins say about
evolutionary outcomes. _Argument by authority_ if there ever was one. But
evolution advocates behave exactly like the religious leaders they despise.

"In the history of physics after Newton, Chomsky says, the prevailing attitude
came to be that anything was acceptable if it could be given a precise
mathematical expression. The predictive success of such mathematical theories
is what mattered, and the metaphysical question about explaining _why_ things
worked in the way the mathematics described receded into the background. For
practical purposes, “matter” came to be treated as just whatever accepted
physical theories happen to say about it. But, Chomsky notes, as early
twentieth-century thinkers like Bertrand Russell and Arthur Eddington pointed
out, physical theory actually tells us very little about what matter is
actually like. It gives us only mathematical structure and is silent about
what fleshes out that structure.",784

"While I hold a lot of skepticism about McGinn's use of mysterianism on the
hard problem of conscious thought, as a Cathlolic I also would tend to be
very, very cautious about castigating mysterianism _altogether_. After all, we
Catholics are in the position of positing that without the grace of faith, we
**could not know** that God is a trinity of persons, and further that we
cannot really _understand_ (fully) the Trinity in our present state (behind
the veil, through a glass darkly).  
  
Suffice it to say: we cannot invoke mysterianism _merely_ because it is a hard
problem. There must be a properly accounted reason that _explains_ our
inability to access the thoughts needed. In the case of God, we are limited
intelligences, and he is unlimited intelligence, and so our minds are not of a
nature capable (on their own) of encompassing the whole of God. But that
account doesn't work for our own minds: presumably, the nature and workings of
our minds are correlative to _our minds_.  
  
However, it may be possible to argue that we cannot _in principle_ access the
way our minds work **directly** , because when we are thinking an immaterial
thought (say, about pi), we cannot ALSO be thinking second-layer thinking
_about_ that thought, (at least, without the danger of disturbing and ending
the thought about pi in order to think the thought ABOUT the thought about pi.
So, (arguably) we could only ever, at best, draw the conclusions about
consciousness in terms of _indirect_ considerations, rather than via direct
access / observation. That doesn't (quite) get you to the mysterian ""we can't
know"", but it may _limit_ what can be said with certainty.",1667
"Hey, Uncommon!  
  
""We can say that their assertions are not scientific.""  
  
I thought that they (when arguing about why evolution ""explains"" why we have
X, for example) could have been smuggling powers to Natural Selection that it
do not have. But since I'm not a literate guy about that I thought that it was
good to make that question - since I don't really know how to properly respond

""That something was God. Believe it, Tadeo, God's purpose, ""before the

Yes! I do believe in God. Perhaps, believe is not a good word for what I have
in mind - but something more certain than that i.e I know that GOD IS!  
  
But what I had in mind when formulating the thoughts of my earlier comments is
the fact that I don't think that we need to put God into that question -
that's why I didn't use His name till now. And I think that because it seems
there is something murkier lurking in the way evolution and natural selection
are said to be (not evolution per see but the way the naturalists and co. say
they are).  
  
So, I think that it is possible to make an Aristotelian-fashioned claim
against that based on the facts that we already know. Because I think there
must be something wrong with what they say and that on Aristotelian grounds we
can prove that. But again, I'm not a philosopher, I'm just a 24-year-old
Brazilian so I'm not in any position to affirm that - I just think that it's
possible.  
  
That's why I thought of bringing up that question and seeing what Ed or other
A-T guys think of it - besides the fact that I think it's something
fundamental to learn about.

"Listening to Goff's discussion makes one realize that this is about how
language does not access certain brain functions. The older version of brain
science as ""thinking meat"" (Harris), moist robots (Dennett), neural correlates

or the ""source and summit model"" (John Paul II) or the brain is a system of
reentrant thalamcortical loops. Hence the conscious functions occur deeper in
the brain or areas for which the scientific language has not been developed.

able to explain because evolution has molded our minds in such a way that they
fall outside the range of our cognitive powers. This view has come to be known
as “mysterianism,” and some philosophers, such as Colin McGinn, have applied
it to the hard problem of consciousness, arguing that solving it is probably
beyond our cognitive capacities.",421
"Also, naturalist's theory of ""spandrels"" is, again, a re-enactment of the
**actualization of hidden potentialities existing in prime matter.** (an
A-Thomistic metaphysical thesis).  
  
Look at this passage from Coyne (Kastrup's ""dim-witted biologist"" :)  
  
 **""I have no idea whether consciousness is a direct product of natural
selection or a byproduct of selection on features like our brain"".**  
https://www.bernardokastrup.com/2020/02/dim-witted-biologist-consciousness-
is.html?m=1  
  
What Coyne is hinting at is that some biological features get actualized
(become ""real"" when subjected to certain ""selective pressures"" - another name
for efficient causes, or the ""inherent powers in the environment""), while
others remain **hidden as potentialities/ ""byproducts"").** Once those
potentialities are exposed to a different set of environmental conditions
(""actualizers"") they come to the surface and become ""real"" (phenotype).  
  
And that's why Jerry Fodor and Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini smelled a rat in
Darwin's theory ( _""What Darwin Got Wrong""_ ), although because they had no
A-T training, they knew there was a problem, but not what the solution was.

Why the Materialist Neo-Darwinian Conception of Nature is Almost Certainly
False"").  
  
Fodor, Palmarini and Nagel, whose amoral, atheistic pals made them into
pariahs, because they dared to challenge the darwinian paradigm. They have
been vindicated.

Very good indeed. Thus perhaps Chomsky's reputation among some as ""the father

modernity being ""the mother of all confusion"". Chomsky's understanding of
language seems to be quite limited although couched misleadingly in
sophisticated mathematics.  
  
So much, then, as well for the importance of the idea that all truth can be
expressed mathematically. Perhaps it can, but perhaps all falsity can also be
so expressed. But then how would mathematics illuminate the difference … as ""A
is true and B is false"" and ""B is true and A is false"" are both expressions,
but they cannot both be true? It seems that there must be something more
fundamental than mathematics … even if it is a formalization of human reason.

 _They say in the text that the microorganisms that formed the mitochondria
were separable in principle - at least they suppose it is that way._  
  
Granting the premise that the theory of endosymbiosis is true, it does nothing
to invalidate A-T metaphysics and a lot to support it. I'll go for this: those
microorganismos were substances at first ( _per se subsistens_ ), capable of
""independent"" life and then merged. A new organism (substantial form) emerged
(new species). The mitochondria would remain there virtually, until through
accidental changes it could no longer re-gain (in a natural manner) its
independence, becoming an obligate intracellular organelle. (But maybe it
could in a laboratory in presence of human beings with adequate technology).  
  
2 questions for the darwinian: what does the environment in which a
mitochondrion lived prior to the fusion had to do with the intracellular
environment in which it found itself after the fusion?? If organisms adapt to
their niches, the extracellular life of the mitochondrial organism would have
had very little in common with the metabolic machinery of the cytoplasm of the
host. Of course these people can elaborate an unfalsifiable nice just-so sory
about how it did happen and the ""powers"" of Natural Selection,* but that's
garbage science and should not be tolerated.  
  
For the A-T proponent, the prime matter had ""silent"" potentialities that got
activated under the circumstances of the fusion (for example metabolical
accomodation that did not disrupt the life of any of the symbionts).  
  
*If they try the ""but there were lots of trial-error attempts and then one worked"", then they are admitting that there is (was) a tendency, for certain types of microorganisms, to co-join so new environments can be tried after that. And not a ""single point mutation or error in the DNA replication machinery"" or any other of the silly non-sense these people claim. An tendencies = natures = teleology = Aristotle.

and regard it as the key to understanding the intractability of the mind-body

materialism itself _generates_ the hard problem of consciousness. Materialism
thus cannot in principle _solve_ that problem. Thinkers like Nagel have been

by no means does one have to be any kind of dualist to see the point.",754

when he suggests that science tells us _nothing_ about the nature of matter.
It doesn’t tell us nothing, just much less than many people suppose. And we
can have evidence for thinking that some theories tell us more about it than
others do. In particular, Chomsky repeats, neuroscience gives us grounds for
concluding that while we are conscious, tables and the like are not.",681

 **In other words, how do you know that natural selection is blind, other than
by assuming it, in which case there is nothing that you can say? But there is
a lot of randomness in the environment in which natural selection operates.
How do you know that God has not set up this randomness through a process
above our understanding, the infinite God's acts being above the understanding
of our finite minds?**  
  
I don't think that really works conceptually. It's certainly true that God
sets up ""randomness"" to achieve His ends in ways above human understanding.
The events leading to the crucifixion of Christ are an obvious example
specifically identified in Scripture, for instance.  
  
But in that case, the events aren't actually random in the relevant sense, but
only _apparently_ random. But once we see the big picture, we realize they
weren't really random after all.  
  
If God orchestrated evolution to bring about humans, then it wouldn't actually
be natural selection that did it. It would be a situation more analogous to
human breeding, what Darwin called ""artificial selection,"" but far more
elaborate.  
  
When it comes to breeding, we don't say that natural selection isn't blind,
but rather that *actual* selection is occurring. The same would apply here.
Natural selection would arguably still be occurring as well (as it is in
human-bred animals), but it would not be the explanation for why things turned
out as they did.  
  
One implication would be that if you were to seed life an another habitable
planet, one where God was NOT orchestrating the creation of human beings, not
much would happen evolutionarily, because natural selection in and of itself
doesn't explain function.",1720

I'm sorry if the topic/questions that I put on the table were repetitive or

don't care that much and I can say the same thing about our philosophers -
they're a bunch of commies and half-baked intellectuals when it comes to
anything that detours from politics that they ''know a lot''. In short, I
don't have anyone to talk about that kind of thing. There are a lot of other
questions that I can't even find materials to work with (all I have is some of
Ed's books and the articles that David Oderberg gives for free on his website,
and still there are a lot of things that I just can't understand right because
it's hard to grasp). So I just want to say that I appreciate a lot of you guys
time and effort - that means a lot to me.  
  
The topic of natural selection and evolution generally opens up a lot of other
questions - questions that mere biologists, say, can't answer in principle.
The examples that I brought up about counting cells as individuals it's
something that was really puzzling me. Of course, as I said I think that's
insane. If cells we're conjoined to survive in the first place why do a lot of
them have to die every day for the sake of others if the 'plan' was just for
the single cell to survive in the first place? Why do we have apoptosis and
the like? Or worse, like I said some comments ago replying to Tom, why do the
'true individuals' (the cells) come to form up 'the illusion' of a single
individual? It means that the dog we see every day that 'seems' to rely on and
works in unity with his own parts as a single thing to chase down the bikers
across the street is just an aggregate of individual cells. That's not just
disturbing I think that it's evil to think something like that.  
  
As you guys can see I'm not a pro in biology. That's why I rely so much on the
''armchair'' philosophy. I can see that it is problematic to say that cells
are individuals but I don't have a 'biological argument' (whatever that means)
to affirm that. But the point is what is the motivation behind that 'science
guys' to affirm something bizarre as that? That's something we should repeal
because a lot of people just buy these ideas without even thinking about it.",2653

questions like “What is it like to see a sunset?,” and “What is it like to see
red?” seem to me interpretable in ways that _are_ susceptible of an answer.
For example, if you had never seen the color red, you might naturally ask
precisely a question like the second one. And if someone then showed you a red
object, you would surely think that your question had been answered. Or, if
someone said “Well, it’s sort of like seeing dark orange, though not quite.
But very different from seeing pale blue,” then you might judge this answer to
be at least somewhat illuminating.",805
"Now, with Newton, Chomsky notes, modern physics abandoned a strictly
mechanical model. What he means is that the early mechanists thought that the
simple push-pull kind of causation that one sees in watches and the like could
provide a model for how the physical world in general works, but Newton
posited forces that did not operate in this way, and indeed the operation of
which he did not explain or claim to explain at all. Gravitation seemed as
“occult” as anything the medieval Aristotelians talked about. Newton’s work
was nevertheless accepted because of the tremendous predictive success
afforded by its mathematical representation of nature. Newtonian physics did
not truly _explain_ the phenomena with which it dealt, but carried the day
because it _described_ them so well.",785
"Goff’s and Frankish’s conversation with Chomsky ends with a brief discussion
of matters of politics and economics. Chomsky says that the excesses of 1920s
capitalism were corrected to some extent beginning in the 30s, leading
eventually to a somewhat more humane form of capitalism by the 50s and 60s.
Then, he thinks, Reagan and Thatcher turned the world back in the direction of
something like the 1920s kind of capitalism. But, he suggests, something like
the reforms that partially corrected that kind of capitalism might occur
again.",538
"Chomsky’s response is that he is partially sympathetic to this, but that he
would be opposed to throwing out of the picture the _psychological_ reactions
we have to the world that people have in mind when they talk about
consciousness. He thinks that the fact that these are genuine phenomena is
evidenced by our ability to theorize about them. (He says that Nelson
Goodman’s book _The Structure of Appearance_ is a good example of how one can
develop a substantive analysis of the way things seem to us in conscious
awareness, whether or not Goodman’s account is ultimately successful.) Chomsky
is also sympathetic to Russell’s view that consciousness is in fact what we
know best.",682
"Perhaps Chomsky would take all of this too to be suspect, but it would be
better to have a less tendentious example to illustrate his general point. And
that’s not hard to find. We could, altering another example famously given by
Chomsky, consider the interrogative sentence “Why do colorless green ideas
sleep furiously?” _That_ clearly is something to which there is no possible
answer, and it suffices to support Chomsky’s point that not every
interrogative corresponds to a genuine question.",496
"This brings us to some further important points raised by Chomsky concerning
the origins of the modern mind-body problem. Gilbert Ryle famously
characterized Descartes’ dualism as the theory of the “ghost in the machine.”
It is often supposed that modern philosophy and science after Descartes
preserved his mechanical model of matter while getting rid of the “ghost” of
the Cartesian mind. But as Goff points out, Chomsky’s view is that the truth
is closer to the opposite of this, and in particular that with Newton, modern
thought essentially “exorcised the machine while leaving the ghost intact.”",601

view from which I approach these matters, but on this particular issue I don’t
think Wuellner’s and Carlson’s account differs in any relevant way from what
your average non-Scholastic philosopher or scientist would say. The idea is,
first, that a hypothesis is a tentative explanation of some empirical event
that will occur _under certain conditions_. Hence, suppose some effect _E_
occurs under certain conditions of type _T_. We might hypothesize that a cause
of type _C_ is responsible, and then go on to test this by bringing about an
instance of _C_ under conditions of type _T_ and seeing whether an instance of
_E_ follows. If it does not, we might form some new hypothesis, to the effect
that it is another sort of cause (of type _D_ , say) that is responsible. But
even if our prediction is confirmed, it is possible in principle that it is
nevertheless not really _C_ that is producing _E_ , but some other causal
factor that is merely correlated with _C_. So we’d need to do further testing
to rule that possibility out. And in any event, if there really is some causal
connection between _C_ and _E_ , only such empirical investigation is going to
reveal it, because the causal relationship between them, even if real, is
going to be _contingent_. Again, it will be _possible_ that something other
than _C_ is the cause, so that the most that further testing can do is render
this supposition _improbable_ (even if, perhaps, _highly_ improbable).",1534

"The ""God Hypothesis"" is just another Ultimate Why question, which Paul Edwards
addressed many years ago in a Intro to Phil textbook  
  
""Regarding our second issue, cosmic why questions, Edwards begins by
considering what he calls “the theological why.” The theological answer to the
theological why posits that a god answers the question of meaning. Major
difficulties here include how we could say anything intelligible about such
disembodied minds, as well as all of the other difficulties involved with
justifying such beliefs. Edwards focuses particularly on whether the
theological answer really answers the question, mentioning a number of
philosophers in this regard: “Schopenhauer referred to all such attempts to
reach a final resting place in the series of causes as treating the causal
principle like a ‘hired cab’ which one dismisses when one has reached one’s
destination. Bertrand Russell objects that such writers work with an obscure
and objectionable notion of explanation: to explain something, we are not at
all required to introduce a “self-sufficient” entity, whatever that may
be…Nagel insists that it is perfectly legitimate to inquire into the reasons
for the existence of the alleged absolute Being…”[ii] Thus, the theological
answer appears to be one of convenience that does not fully answer our query;
rather, it stops the inquiry by asking no more why questions.  
  
Edwards differentiates the theological why question—are there gods and do they
provide the ultimate explanation?—from what he calls the “super-ultimate why.”
A person posing this latter question regards the theological answer as not
going far enough because it does not answer questions such as “Why are there
gods at all?” or “Why is there anything at all?” or “Why does everything that
is, exist?” The theological answer simply puts an end to why questions
arbitrarily; it stops short of pushing the question to its ultimate end. One
might respond that it is obsessive to continually ask why questions, but most
reflective persons do ask “Why does anything or everything exist?” suggesting
that the question is basic to thoughtful persons. Of course, it may be that we
just don’t know the answer to this ultimate mystery—all we can say is that the
existence of anything is a mystery, its ultimate explanation remaining always
beyond us.  
  
According to Edwards, while some philosophers take the ultimate why question
seriously many others argue that it is meaningless. The reason for this is
that if a question cannot in principle be answered, as so many philosophers
claim about this super ultimate why question, then that question is
meaningless. Critics of this view agree that the question is radically
different from all others but disagree that it is meaningless. They respond
that ordinarily, questions must in principle be capable of being answered to
be meaningful, but not in the case of this ultimate question. Yet if a
question really cannot be answered, and if all possible answers have been
ruled out a priori, is that not the very definition of a meaningless question?  
  
Another way of arriving at the conclusion that the question “why does
everything exist?” is meaningless, is to consider how when we ordinarily ask
“why x?” we assume the answer is something other than x. But in the case of
“why anything at all?” it is not possible to find something outside of
everything to explain everything. So meaningful why questions are those which
are about anything in the set of all things, but if our why question is about
something other than everything, then why has lost its meaning because it is
logically impossible to have an answer.""  ",3661
"Of course, someone might claim that there are no good arguments other than
those that involve empirical hypothesis formation and testing. (Good luck
making sense of mathematics on that supposition.) But whether that really is
the case is precisely part of what is in dispute between classical theism and
atheism of the kind inspired by scientism. Hence, without an independent
argument establishing that such arguments are the only respectable ones, such
an objection would simply beg the question.",498
"Could it be said, then, that even if arguing via empirical hypothesis
formation and testing does not get us _all_ the way to God, it can still be
useful in getting us _part_ of the way? Well, to be fair, I’d be happy to
consider a specific purported example to see exactly what such an objector has
in mind. But _if_ the reasoning involved is like that described above, then I
would answer in the negative.",406

are more like finding a bunch of leaves organised in a perfect triangle, which
obviously can't be caused by non-intelligent causes, but either by animals or
humans.  
  
And so arguments from design get us closer to God insofar as they purport to
show evidence which points to an intelligent cause, and one that's above us as
well. Which COULD still be explained by agents other than God, but at least
that narrows things down a lot - they have to be intelligent and powerful
agents.

created life on Earth directly, which is a pre-existing claim which can be
supported somewhat, in a real way, with design arguments, even though not

relationship between God and the world as that is understood by classical
theism. God’s creating the world is not a matter of making it the case that
_this_ specific thing happens in the world rather than _that_ specific thing.
Rather, creation is a matter of making it the case that there is _any world at
all_. Moreover, theism holds that the fact that there is any world at all is
something that _could not even in principle_ have obtained in the absence of
divine creative action. For classical theism, if we’re talking about a view
according to which the world _might_ have existed apart from God, but simply
_happens_ not to do so, then we’re not really talking about _theism_ but
rather about something that only superficially resembles it.",821

derive as a 'hypothesis,' albeit a hypothesis which make the world

information in a philosophical argument to make theological conclusions. Where
you have said that theological philosophy or natural theology should be
grounded in the philosophy of nature not the natural sciences. Although I like
your leaf analogy in showing that level 2 partial explanation would be
deficient, I was wondering wouldn’t a level 4 (unitive experience) and level 5
(beatific vision) conception render a level 3 conception deficient as well,
consequently undermining a classical theistic approach? Shouldn’t we just see
each conception on a pathway to a mature and fuller understanding of God? Or
would you argue that a level 2 conception of God, despite some ostensible
apologetic utility, does more damage than good, in a way that a level 3
conception does not when compared to a level 4 and 5? And if so how so?

this is improbable given the empirical evidence. Or it is as absurd as a
mathematician proposing that there is solid confirming empirical evidence that

provide an argument for the claim that 12 x 48 = 576, or for the claim that
there is such a thing as the Form of the Good, or, again, for the claim that
the world could not exist even in principle apart from God. The point, again,
is that the _kind_ of argumentation we would have to give would not involve
forming hypotheses and then coming up with ways to test them empirically. That

"As a Catholic who accepts classical theism and divine simplicity, this topic
of freedom vs. necessity of creation is one that I struggle with.  
  
God's decision to create or not to create does not end with that binary
choice; rather the choice to create involves the further choice of WHAT to
create, out of an infinite number of possibilities.  
  
Good, being omniscient, would know what all these possible creations are, and
also know which ones are better, which less good, and which one is best of
all.  
  
Being infinitely good, would it not go against His nature to choose a lesser
good, as against a better one? Similarly, would it not go against His nature
to to choose not to create, if He knows that the choice to create is better?  
  
Does this all come down more to definitions than substance? Perhaps the
meaning of ""freedom"" in the context of the Divinity is something that our
human minds can't quite grasp? Do freedom, necessity, and goodness in some
sense ""merge"" together into the simple infinity of God?

"God's act of creation is God's very essence. That's why creation is a mistery
we can not fully grasp. But I think we can show that this doctrine is coherent
- or, at least, we can show that the arguments against this doctrine fail.  
  
God has but one act of will - the act by which God wills himself. And God
wills everything in the act of willing himself. This Divine Act is the same in
every possible world. However, just as a point can be considered as the
maximal or the minimum point of different parabolas, or the zero of many
different lines, God's Will can be considered as the source of different
worlds. His act of Will is really the same, but virtually distinct across
possible worlds.  
  
In fact, Saint Thomas says in the Summa contra Gentiles that sometimes a causa
has a non-necessary relation with its effects. During the Middle Ages, of
course, he was not aware of any probabilistic events - intrinsically
probabilistic, I mean, like Quantum Mechanics. But his answer has this deep
insight: a cause may produce its effects, not out of necessity, but randomly
or because of a free choice.  
  
The argument against Divine Simplicity shifts, at this point, towards
intentional directedness. But here I think the argument presupposes an
anthropomorphic conception of Divine Choice. We do not know anything about
God's psychological life. We can not affirm nor deny the possibility of
choosing different things in the same Divine Act.

thta is not true. Libertarian free will means freedom of the _will_. That

"@Walter  
  
You are only different after the decision, not before. The decision is itself
a self-determination to a possibility. The self-determination does not exist
until actually willed. Hence why it is free. We can conceive different
outcomes because the determination is not there until it is there; there is a
real sense in which the agent creates the determination. This is the reason I
emphasized simultaneous agent causation as well as equivocal causation. Event
causation gets you a vicious regress or no real decision at all.  
  
As far as ""randomness"" goes, that would only hold if you assume the outcomes
already have some nascent individually determinate reality that are coin
flipped between, which is not the case here; moreover the possibilities
considered altogether can also be viewed as a region that an agent's
individual determinations are bounded by.  
  
Further, a distribution of an agent's decisions does not tell you by what
means they come about. Heads on a coin flip is not determined by P(H)=0.5.
It's determined by the physics of an actual flip; P(H) tends to 0.5 given the
symmetry of a coin.  
  
With respect to an agent, given their beliefs and their character you can have
a rough idea of how they will act; but that would just constitute the
boundaries of decisions, not the actual act of self-determination itself.  
  
The relevance to divine simplicity is quite clear since this issue is integral
to analogously understanding God's will and freedom in relation to modal
collapse.  
  
@JoeD  
  
The objection begs the question. The choice does not exist in the agent
somehow that is then univocally transmitted into the outcome, which is what
the objection requires.  
  
The choice is in fact created in a certain sense and reflects a way the agent
can self determine. Prior to the choice there is nothing and no self-
determination. There is no contrastive otherwise possible here. Hence the
actual free willing is sufficient to explain the choice because it is
coincident with the choice. Self-determination is something like marking off a
number in a continuous region, not picking a stone out of a discrete pile of
stones. The determination and the decision are one in the same thing, not two
events, and so the sui generis willings are relevantly explanatory.",2309

I don't think simultaneity is particularly important here. The thing is that
in order to maintain the indeterminism of a free choice it must be the case
that the agent at t can be able to cause either X or ~X without either effect
*requiring* a change in intrinsic properties. They might ENTAIL a change (A
now has the property of having chosen X, say), in our case, but still this
would be a consequence of the choice. If there was a requirement for a
difference in properties then you could never have true indeterminism in the
choice, because if it had P (and P were incompatible with the choosing of ~X,
say) the cause would not be able to cause the effect that would be
incompatible with the property. Whether simultaneously or diachronically.",1009
"And also: I have quite explicitly said in previous posts that if there is a
problem here, it has to do with the God's intention/reasons for X being the
same as God's intention/reasons for ~X. That is a different issue which is
only tangentially related with divine creative freedom - the actual problem
there is with the multiplicity of divine ideas. I can grant (as I have granted
before) that there can be an objection from the fact that prima facie in DS
God's ideas would all be the same, but there should be a multiplicity, etc.
This is something that strikes us as being quite different from how us humans
think (and by extension, intend things).  
  
This is not the problem of ""how could God freely cause different things in
different worlds without any intrinsic differences in God between worlds???"".
I have been very clear and precise in my comments that it is *this* that I
think is a bad objection which would also affect LFW for humans, not just God.
And I have explained why.  
  
So, using the terms in our latest posts: if we are to assume these ""Wills"" as
you want, they would have to not determine the action. Someone would have both
the ""Will-to-X"" and the ""Will-to-not-X"" and then be able to
indeterministically cause either X or ~X in that case. So there would be no
intrinsic difference in the subject required for him to cause X or cause ~X in
that situation. The same as God.  
  
What you CAN object is that, differently from us, under DS in God the ""Will-
to-X"" would be the same as the ""Will-to-not-X"" and you could think that this
is absurd. But then as I said this is a different objection - it's basically
the issue of the multiplicity of divine ideas, only tangentially related to
free choice (if one thinks ideas are required for choices). The issues of ""5
is different than 2!"" etc. I have talked about this in my last reply to
Vincent. On this topic I'd just recommend Dolezal's model and how I think
different facts can have the same truthmaker (similarly to how triangularity

Thanks you all for your responses.  
  
Talmid, you write: ""Either it [Pure Existence] is infinite or it is finite.

PE, which is contradictory, so PE has to be infinite.""  
  
What your argument really proves is that the notion of ""pure existence"" is
utterly amorphous: it is not tied to any particular form. But by the same
token, since it has no form, we cannot say that it is positively infinite,
either; all we can say is that it has no positive characteristics at all.  
  
RunDec, you object to my assertion that the alleged distinction between a
thing's essence and its existence can be explained in terms of the form-matter
distinction, by arguing as follows: ""the existence of an animal might require
its material exemplification, but this is not the case with immaterial beings
(such as souls, angels, God, or any other candidates).""  
  
Re separated souls: at least we can say that they once had bodies and that
they will one day have them back, so we can regard them as being ""branded,"" so
to speak, by the matter they informed. Re angels: I'm sure you're well aware
that there were many medieval philosophers who held that angels are not pure
forms, but possess a kind of spiritual matter, allowing two or more angels to
be of the same species. As for God, His essence and existence are commonly
held to be identical, anyway.  
  
You also ask, ""if God had an accident distinct from himself (his essence),
where would this accident come from? It can't come from the essence lest you
accept the precedence of a perfectly simple Essence which is the source of all
things, which is what you're trying to avoid.""  
  
I'm quite happy to say that God's essence is simple. What I insist is that
God's Mind or Essence has multiple thoughts and intentions which are
contingent accidents - e.g. God's concept of this universe, and His intention
to make it.  
  
You deny that having an intention is a necessary condition for making a choice
because ""if it were, we would never be able to choose anything, since we would
have to choose our intention before being able to make a choice, and that is
circular or regressive."" However, your argument misconstrues my position,
which is that an agent's choice to do something must be (at least logically,
even if not temporally) preceded by a plan or intention to do it. Otherwise,
it would be impossible to attribute an action A to spiritual agent X rather
than spiritual agent Y, as neither of them would have done anything to
identify it as the cause of A. But although I produce things (or states of
affairs) as an agent, I do not ""produce"" my intentions; I just have them. They
are voluntary, but not in the same sense that my actions are. My intentions
have no prior cause; I just have them, and that's all. So too with God.  
  
I don't have any problem with an agent either choosing to bring about X or
choosing not to bring about X, and having an identical causal history in both
cases. What bothers me is the notion of an agent acting without a plan. That
just makes no sense. Cheers.

If you can either go the the right or to the left, then if you choose (or
'decide') to go to the left, your mind has the 'content' ""go to the left"".

_prior_ prior intention (a second-order prior intention) in order form the
aforementioned prior intention, because 'logically' (Vincent says) one must
form intentions _before acting_ ; and so clearly forming an intention/making a

OK, here is a bit more:  
  
I avoid using phrases or concepts like ""all possible worlds"" as confusing or
ambiguous and easily giving rise to dispute that can never be resolved, for
how can our human minds encompass all possibility, especially if we admit that
God must know more about what is possible than we can. I don't mean to claim
that talk about all possible worlds does not have its place or cannot be
useful. I just like to avoid it when possible, and so I favor ""all imaginable
worlds"".  
  
By ""imaginable"" I mean strictly what is limited to normal human imagination,
not the ""imagination"" of God, angels, people experiencing the beatific vision,
etc. Just people like you and me. It greatly simplifies discussion and
simplicity is what we are looking for.  
  
I make a further simplification by saying that our ideas about all imaginable
worlds must be communicable to other ordinary people. If it can't be
communicated there is not much use in having the idea. It won't get anywhere.  
  
This entails a further restriction, and that is that the communication must be
verbal - in words that other people can understand. This could be widened
somewhat. For example, ideas could be communicated by images, non verbal
sounds, moving imagery, with or without sound, etc. But I hope you do not
object to my just restricting it to words alone, again for simplicity. I
believe that whatever can be said about communication by words alone can be
extended to these other forms of communication.  
  
So, I will talk about all _imaginable_ worlds, imaginable to ordinary people,
ideas of which must be verbally communicable to other humans.

""The whole point of LFW is that the will is not determined. LFW does not mean
you can have no will that determines your choice.  
It doesn't matter where that will came from, it there is a will, then my
argument goes through.  
If you will vanilla ice (for whatever reason), then, unless something happens
to prevent this choice you have vanilla ice and not chocolate ice.""  
  
How on earth can I choose what to eat, then? The picture you described is
literally my will - completely outside of my control - determining my choice
to either get vanilla or chocolate depending on some property arising in it -
and you suggest that the causal origin of that property is irrelevant for
whether we are libertarian free or not! That it doesn't matter where it came
from. So in your model I can - with no control over it, no choice over it -
just get a ""will"" to have vanilla ice and this will make me get vanilla ice
instead of chocolate (unless something happens to prevent it, again something
over which I presumably have no control over since all my actions would just
follow upon another will arising, and it wouldn't matter where that will came
from, according to you).  
In what world is that libertarian freedom? That is just people being
determined by a will over which they have no control. I don't think any LFW
proponent would agree with that model; certainly I think most LFW theorists
would agree with me. And then you just refuse to elaborate on the potential
regress of the origins of the ""will"" and how, in your model, it cannot arise
by the choice of the agent (since you must refuse that A at t in S can cause
either X or ~X).  
I am surprised that you think this would count as LFW.  
  
I take it as essential that in LFW *we* are the ones making our choices, in an
indeterministic but non-stochastic way; that we cause our actions and do so in
such a way that, when we're deliberating, we can really cause one or the other
at that moment, and thus under the same set of intrinsic properties.  
  
I say we can reach an agreement and a common conclusion here: you and I have
radically different ideas of LFW. So if someone accepts your model, then
indeed they will have a problem with God's choice in DS. If someone subscribes
to your model of LFW, then that objection to DS is a serious one, and perhaps
there is no way around it.  
  
But if someone accepts my model of LFW (or, even more modestly, accepts my
model as metaphysically possible) instead, then the problem disappears.
Because in my model, the agent can cause either X or ~X without requiring a
difference in intrinsic properties for choosing one or the other. It's not
unique to God, it's the same for humans, too.  
  
So if someone accepts your model of libertarian freedom (call it LFW1) then
the objection is very much alive. Well done. But if someone prefers my model
(call it LFW2) instead, the objection isn't really impressive. I think that's
fair.",2949

"Walter,  
  
Libertarian freedom entails that you can, at the same time, have non-
determining reasons for doing X and non-determining reasons for not-doing-X.
What is the intention, beyond the choosing of one over the other? It is when
you intend (and hence have chosen) to do one instead of the other, and thus
are ready intending the action. If the intention is not the choice, then it
would be the motivation. And in both cases there is no difference between our
case of LFW and God's:  
  
Before I finally make my choice, I have motivations for X and ~X. In w1 I go
on to choose X; in w2 I go on to choose ~X. And yet there is no difference in
my intrinsic properties between w1 and w2.  
  
This is what is weird in LFW, but as explained, it is the same for God as well
as for us. So this is no objection against divine simplicity per se.  
  
But perhaps you think that the ""intention"" is neither the choosing nor the
motivation, but an accompanying mental state that is always present when, and
only when, a choice is made. In that case, the intention would NOT be a
necessary condition for a choice being made. Because if it were, we would
never be able to choose anything, since we would have to choose our intention
before being able to make a choice, and that is circular or regressive. I can,
under motivations for both X and ~X, and with no intention whatsoever (since I
haven't made the choice yet), choose to do X or ~X and thus effectively,
freely bring about X or ~X without this ""intention"" entity/property. So God's
having or not having an intention in this case would be irrelevant for his
power to choose, but it ALSO is the same for us.  
  
But if the the problem is that God must be different when he chooses X as
opposed to ~X, then again this would not work under libertarian freedom for us
as either. Because (again) when you choose between X (in w1) or ~X (in w2),
the cause of your choice has exactly the same intrinsic properties between
worlds. The cause of your choosing X in w1 is you at t in state S; and the
cause of your choosing ~X in w2 is you at t in state S. There is a branching,
and yet there is no difference in intrinsic properties of you at t between
worlds. So, once again: it is the same for us and God, and libertarian freedom
does not require subjects to change in intrinsic properties between worlds in
order to make choices.",2377

You do avoid challenge and you avoid mine because you can't answer it.  
  
You would first have to understand the consequences of the bitwise XOR
operation between a bitwise random sequence and an intelligible sequence. I
will start with finite sequences and we can think of them as displayed on a
computer screen under some standard protocol that displays sequences of bits
as words on a computer screen, or at least it does if the sequence of bits are
not such that what is displayed is nonsense. Now I can get a random sequence
with 50/50 bits by a physical process. It could actually display as something
intelligible but it is not likely.  
  
Let us call this random sequence A. Let us call B an actually intelligible
sequence. It consists of meaningful words converted into a sequence of bits so
that they will display as the meaningful words when displayed under the
standard protocol being used.  
  
It can easily be shown that when a third sequence, C, is created by doing the
operation A XOR B -> C, that C is as random as A and is as unlikely as A to
display as anything meaningful.  
  
Now, the beginning of a system:  
  
It can also easily be shown that A, B, and C, together, have the property such
that any two of them produce the third sequence when the bitwise XOR operation
is performed on the other two. Thus:  
  
A XOR B -> C,  
B XOR C -> A, and  
C XOR A -> B.  
  
As stated above as easily demonstrated, if A is random, then so is C. But we
began with a random A and then chose B to be intelligible, so if we XOR the
two random sequences (""disordered"" is a better word here than ""random"", but
for now I stick with ""random""), we get the intelligible sequence that we
purposely chose. Now here is the crux of the beginning of the system:  
  
The random sequence A that we began with cannot, by itself, give us the chosen
sequence B. A is random after all. It could have been any similarly random
sequence, so if any random sequence could be decoded into the chosen sequence,
how could it be decoded into a different chosen sequence had a different one
been chosen? If there was some process dependent upon the chosen sequence by
which any random sequence could be decoded into the particular chosen
sequence, then the chosen sequence would already have to be known before the
correct process that works could be used. So the random sequence A cannot
have, intrinsic to itself, the information thatispecifies the chosen sequence.
Furthermore, since the second random sequence was produced using the XOR
operation with the chosen sequence and the chosen sequence could have been
_any_ intelligible sequence, we have that a second random sequence C exists
for any initial random A and chosen B. For random A there exists a random C
that gives B, the intelligible sequence, no matter what intelligible sequence
Biwas chosen.  
  
By just guessing at what C happens to be, A XOR C is most likely nonsense, but
if it results in an intelligible B, it is very unlikely to be the pre-chosen
B. It is in fact as likely as correctly guessing the pre-chosen B from all
possible intelligible sequences (this is slightly simplified for clarity).  
  
This is the beginning of a system based on simplicity that will show that God
does not have to be ruled by the logic that you, Walter, futilely use to try
to impose your own ideas as limits on God.

""speaking of free will, it disturbs me greatly that traditional Catholic
theology has not considered animal abuse to be a deadly sin like Lust or
Gluttony. That goes very contrary to religions like Judaism or Buddhism.""  
  
First, note of pre-Christian Judaism that it certainly permitted the use of
animals  
for human needs, including for rites of sacrifice. Christianity does not
include the use of animals for sacrifice so from your point of view that is an
improvement.  
  
Second, note that Jesus said:  
  
""Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come
to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth
pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be
fulfilled."" (Matthew 5:17-20 KJV)  
  
But much of what is specifically listed as law in pre-Christian Judaism is
subsumed in Christianity as Love rather than being specifically listed, so
while abuse of animals is not listed, it is an act of hatred against what God
loves, which includes all of Creation. Now we have been given all of material
Creation for our proper and needful use, but an act of hatred against anything
is a turning from God and is a mortal or deadly sin as Christians always
understood.  
  
So at no time did Christianity embrace the evil treatment of animals. It would
have always been recognized as hate. But as in many other things, a formal
doctrine against the mistreatment of animals was later worked out from these
foundational principles of Christianity. It certainly is explicit now. See,
for example, the Catechism as promulgated by Pope John Paul II.  
  
Buddhism is not a development of Christianity or Judaism. Therefore, its rites
and rules, while based on partial truth, are not held wholly correct. We
cannot properly be directed by Bhuddhist doctrine.

Well then, the simplicity of a random number is greater than the simplicity of
science, logic, or mathematics. The XOR process is meant to show that even a
finite random sequence can mean any predetermined thing, but we cannot unravel
its intended meaning, except by luck, and even then, there is no way to know
that the lucky guess was correct, because it could mean anything that would
fit against its length, as I wrote earlier.  
  
The logic that you and I use, as expressed by Aristotle, is complex. The rules
of inference are ordered and detailed in a complex way that cannot be reduced
to the simplicity of a random number, which yet contains them if it is long
enough, as I described. I earlier described how 2+2 could easily be made equal
to 3 as shown by video games running a sequence that displays such things on a
screen (ask me if this was somewhere else that I discussed it). With the
infinite random sequence, an image (only) of God, these things are written an
infinite number of times. Any finite part of it that is long enough, running
on a computer, could always show our logic expressed as we know it. It could
also always show the rules incorrectly expressed. That is because the
predetermined meaning that could be anything intended, in the image, is not
open to us and the XOR process shows that no specific random sequence matters.
It's all in there somewhere and the computer can show anything you can imagine
(now I will include moving images). It could show that the world runs exactly
as our sight and sound senses tell us it runs except that if you walk 500
steps without stopping you step on the tines of a rake that suddenly appears
and it pops up and gives you a good whack on the head and then disappears. Yet
for some reason, people mentally (only) start to count their steps, they do
not know why they are doing it, and they forget where they are in their count
long before they reach 500. Then after 500 - whack!  
  
Logic in this computable world would have to be different from the logic we
love and know in order to account for these abnormal (in our world) mental
phenomena. God knows this idea, but is not limited by it. If you don't like
it, you can always ignore this computable meaning and only pay attention to
the one you like. It's in there too but so are great numbers of other
computable meanings.  
  
Something that suggests this is the arrangement of the grains of sand on a
beach washed by winds, waves, and disturbed by animals, including humans with
their various activities, motorised or not, disturbed by their nuclear
activity, etc. Now look at the arrangement of the grains as they change for a
few days and then try to articulate something in the spirit of science as we
know it that will allow you to accurately predict the arrangement of the
grains into the future. I speak not here of the lack of sufficient
information. I speak of the impossibility of knowing what agents with free
will will do that will convert their mental phenomena into tangible acts.

get to it) involves distinguishing between absolute necessity (i.e. it follows
from the nature of the thing) and conditional necessity (which is brought
about by a specific set of circumstances) and having a proper understanding of
God's eternal knowledge (not foreknowledge) as a presentialist view, wherein
God sees all things which are (for us) past, present, and future all as the
present and immediately available. This knowledge of what presently is does
not necessarily preclude the rational agent from choosing to do otherwise in
that moment other than what he or she was already doing, i.e. it is
conditionally necessary and not absolutely necessary.

""Of course there is a difference in my intrinsic properties between w1 and w2.
Otherwise there is no reason why I choose X over ~X.  
The cause of my choosing X in w1 is me with my intention to choose X, which is
an intrinsic property.  
You are describing a random process instead of a choice.""  
  
No, Walter, there is no intrinsic difference if LFW is true, and this is
precisely how there can be a libertarian free choice. Otherwise the presence
of you + the intention would determine the resulting action and we would no
longer have libertarian freedom. If the cause were you and the intention, then
in order to preserve libertarian freedom you would have to cause your
intention. But then to cause your intention you would end up in an infinite
regress, unless you accept that you at t in state S can cause Intention (what
it does in w1) or not cause it (what it does in w2). In other words: there is
no difference in intrinsic properties in the agent in worlds 1 and 2, and yet
the agent can cause X or ~X. See? That's my point.  
  
There is literally no difference between humans and God when it comes to this
weird aspect of libertarian freedom. For determinism to be avoided, it must be
the case that someone at t in state S can cause both X or ~X. For our
libertarian choice of X, there is a time t which is the earliest time with the
property that after t it is no longer causally possible for us to choose ~X
instead. How else do you think libertarian freedom could work, without
determinism? If the choice follows a difference in intrinsic properties, then
the choice would be determined by such a difference and thus would no longer
be libertarian, lest we cause the difference in properties (the intention,
say), but then the same problem would reappear.  
  
You say that this is ""random"". That is a common accusation by those who
*reject* libertarian freedom. I do not accept that it is random; I believe
libertarian choice is a sui generis category that is neither random nor
deterministic, but that is beside the point. My response was that the
""problem"" Vincent was pointing out doesn't just affect Divine Simplicity, but
also libertarian freedom for humans. It is THE SAME THING for us. The issue
there doesn't lie with classical theism, but LFW; LFW by itself requires that
an agent can be able to (non-randomly) bring about different effects without
there being any change in the intrinsic properties of the agent when it is
choosing.  
  
So if you have a problem with God choosing to cause different things without
requiring any difference in intrinsic properties as a condition for that, you
should also have a problem with libertarian freedom for humans. Which you
probably do (you probably do not accept LFW). Vincent however does presumably
accept LFW, so he has to choose between rejecting LFW altogether or dropping
that objection.  
  
The only difference between us and God in this case is you could argue that
our intrinsic properties change *after* we have CHOSEN (not when we are
choosING). But so what? It is not even clear to me that we must change
intrinsically after we have chosen; why insist that this must happen
universally, even with God? It would still be the case that for a libertarian
free choice to be made, the cause need not incur in change, since the cause
can indeed, under the same exact intrinsic properties, bring about different
effects. So the objection against God's choosing is worthless.  
  
One could go on to complain about God's contingent knowledge of what he in
fact chose (again, a matter of what could change AFTER a choice), but that is
a different objection - the one that pertains to God's contingent knowledge.

"Hey, can someone explain to me the relation between how Classical Theism God -
Our Father - is Omniscient and our free will? Because there is a lot of

I ask that because (some) interpretations of it may turn the world and its

contingent truths how can they be otherwise? How can we have the freedom to
change our minds and somewhat our 'destiny' (pardon for the expression)

Given that, as I understand it, to qualify as a classical theist, a thinker
has to, principally, adhere to divine simplicity, I readily concede that this
is compatible with a necessitarian view, and that of many thinkers classified
as such. This compatibility, however, obviously does not entail its truth. Fr.
Davies seems to concern himself with rebutting the claim that divine
simplicity entails it, and to achieve this he doesn’t need to positively prove
the account he happens to think is the true classical theist account, namely,
presumably that of St. Thomas. After all, it’s not like classical theism is a
concrete comprehensive philosophical doctrine or “system” as opposed to a
(contingently useful) classification abstracting from the all-important
theoretical peculiarities.  
  
Now, in light of your reference to pure act, I assumed that it is this account
that you had in mind, and I submit that, I find, the way the pure act argument
works is straightforward, really: agents act for an end, and where there is no
necessary relation between the means and an end, there is no necessity.
Because, on the one hand, God is pure act, something per se perfect, and is
the only possible end for His acts, and creatures fail to contribute anything
to His perfection, on the other, God cannot be said to will the creatures
necessarily. See e.g. Ia q. 19 a. 3.

teleological nature of causation that allow them to make this argument.",1524
"@RunDec I wonder if stochasticism can still be connected to LFW insofar as
it's often easy to predict what a person will do when faced with a set of
choices due to pre-existing inclinations that strongly incline him one way or
the other.  
  
An inclination towards one particular thing can be very strong to the point
where a person could basically choose that object almost every time basically,
as long as the person still has the ability to choose differently, even though
it's harder.  
  
Heck, I lean towards thinking that even if an individual always chose the same
object every single time, with a very strong inclination, that still wouldn't
be a problem for LFW, because the concept of being able to choose differently
is distinct from how many times one does so.  
  
One could thereby rewind the tape of time / reality indefinitely many times
and get the same choice made by a person, without this in any way undermining
LFW.  
  
On a different note, here's an objection to LFW I once saw that I'd like to
know your thoughts on:  
  
The idea of self-explaining sui generis choices are actually gibberish even
with LFW. If my free choice is sufficient to explain itself to the exclusion
of other possibilities, it isn't indeterministic. If it isn't, then there's no
reason in my will or otherwise why I chose as I did and I'm not free. So we
have compatibilism.

We use the same logic, the logic that God gave us. It is sufficient to

everything about God as that is unlimited and infinite (as the integers are
infinite in number yet are limited by not being all ratios or fractions).  
  
We can make progress towards infinity in the same way that 8 is closer to a
completed infinity than 6 (I am not speaking of my infinite sequence here,

Yes; Aquinas, who regards the intellect as a free power, calls this 'free
decision', and it's part of his account of free will -- human freedom in the
full sense includes free decision in the intellect and free choice in the
will, and what we call 'free will' is often the interplay between the
intellect and the will as free powers. On Aquinas's view, the intellect can
freely infer (suspend judgment, etc.) in matters that do not involve necessary
truths, and so it can likewise select without necessitation non-necessary
goods to consider, and thereby sometimes influence the options available to
the will's free choice, not by determining the will, but by shifting the non-

heis just naturally (necessarily) making good things does not strike me as

An intelligible verbal communication can exist on a computer as a sequence of
1's and 0's that is made intelligible through an operational protocol that
casts it to the monitor as readable words. No computer can print an infinite
sequence to the screen, but a finite subsequence can be read through a
computer this way. There is an absolute difference between an infinite
sequence and a finite sequence here. Now no matter what the intelligible
communication, it must exist throughout the infinite bitwise random sequence
as a subsequence, normally distributed (from Wikipedia ""Normal Number"" on an
infinite sequence of ""coin tosses"" : ""If a number is normal, no finite
combination of digits of a given length occurs more frequently than any other
combination of the same length"").  
  
Yet in searching for the specific intelligible verbal subsequence described
earlier it is impossible to know, if it is not found, that the infinite
sequence is biased - is not normal, for the search could encompass a length of
the infinite sequence that just does not contain the verbal subsequence. For
example the sequence 01 should appear in 25% of the 2 bit subsequences, but if
the sequence consisting of a million 1's in a row is where you happen to look
for 01, you will not find 01 normally distributed in the million 1's. Such
lengths missing the verbal subsequence must also appear in the infinite
sequence, and they must also be normally distributed if the infinite sequence
is normal, which it must be if it is bitwise 50/50 random.  
  
This model of simplicity contains all human imaginable worlds that can be
verbally communicated and yet no matter how much of it is human examined
(i.e., the examination must be finite), a verbally communicable description of
the finite world might never be found. You might just always be looking in the
wrong place.

I am also puzzled by this. But since I am not bound by dogma, I am open to
accepting that God creates out of a necessity of his perfect nature. But it'd
be nice if it can be avoided.  
  
So there's a lot to be said about this, and what I'll mention doesn't come
close to covering the whole topic, but I think it's an interesting thought,
and maybe an escape route. Consider: one could deny that perfect goodness MUST
entail always doing the best, if the best is supererogatory. The very notion
of a supererogatory action is that it's a good action you can perform without
being anything like an obligation. We can imagine you can, for instance,
donate 100 dollars to a charity right now, and it would be good and virtuous
of you, but it wouldn't be an obligation. You can fail to do it without
thereby incurring in sin or evil.  
  
I think creation might be a supererogatory good like that. If it's
supererogatory, then God would be very willing to create (or create the best)
without nevertheless *having* to create. So you could say God is somehow
likely to perform supererogatory actions, but not determined (thus preserving
contingency).  
  
I don't think this works for the problem of evil or anything like that (I very
much believe God must, for example, prevent or stop a torture if there is no
greater good to be gained from permitting it), but I think it's a nice enough
candidate to solve the necessitarian issue",1663

"A rather lively discussion concerning LFW which has long been lacking with
respect to divine freedom (and to a more indirect extent, modal collapse).  
  
@RunDec @Walter  
  
As far as I can tell, there has been a hidden assumption about event causation
here: namely ""choose x"" is some event then leading to ""x occurs"". That is
completely wrong, in that it would destroy the unity of an action and would
lead to a vicious regress regarding volition. Rather ""choose x"" and ""x occurs""
is a simultaneous causal relationship of an action of a volitional agent.  
  
A better description of LFW here (in its most bare bones form as self-
generated action; deliberation is a type of it) is not so much in weighing
scales, but something like picking a point on a circle: namely, insofar as the
formula of a circle only provides an undifferentiated sea of possibles but no
actual ones, I have to actualize some particular point, and prior to that
actualization, the point is just a mere possible, not something with an
individual actual reality; it cannot even be considered of itself a true
individual reality apart from my actualization.  
  
You could say that relies on a dubious notion of an infinity of options, but
the basic idea does not change even for finite options. Suppose I have C = {X,
Y}. C taken of itself is just an undifferentiated sea of possibles, to get X I
would need C[0] while for Y I would need C[1]. That caused ""indexing"" is just
what a self-determined action is. Since that ""indexing"" is not prior to the
action but simultaneous with it, it is self-determined and free; nor is it
some random ""coin flip"" because the 0ing and 1ing are not some earlier
floating states (which would also generate a vicious regress as above) but
coincident with the volition itself. In fact, it is more accurate to describe
""0ing"" and ""1ing"" as descriptions of self-determinations, not as ""things"".

something like picking from already existent states competing for dominance.",2053

changeable, contrary to divine simplicity? And if he is in fact unchangeable

thus created of necessity rather than freely? In response, Davies points out,
first, that creating _freely_ simply does not in fact entail _changing_.
Certainly it simply begs the question to assume otherwise. For the classical

anything distinct from him, so that nothing in his nature can compel him to
create. And since, the classical theist also argues (and again on independent
grounds) there is nothing apart from God that God did not create, there can be
nothing distinct from him that compels him to create""  
  
I don't see how that works.  
  
1- if it's being argued that the act is free simply because it isn't being
compelled by anything external to God, nevertheless it could still be
compelled by God's nature - that is, what is internal to God, not external. If
this is free, it is not *libertarian* free however, and entails that creation
is necessary: necessitated by God's nature;  
  
2- if it is argued that there is nothing internal to God that could compel
him, because he is pure actuality, it's not clear that the argument works. For
all we know, an internal necessity need not be construed as some kind of
""lack"", in the sense that ""humans need food to survive"". God didn't need
creation to not be lonely or any other nonsense. But it could be a ""need"" in
the sense of a necessary manifestation of the divine nature/goodness. Just
like how it's true that ""God needs to not create a world of horrendous
pointless torture"" (it is necessary from his nature), it could be that God's
nature compels him to create - as, for example, Leibniz believed (leibnizian
optimism); the neoplatonists believed (emanation); or Pseudo-Dionysius

How doesn't _Davies_ beg the question here?  
What Davies is saying here is that creating freely doesn't entail changing

You mention souls having to be branded by their bodies - nevertheless, once
the soul loses the body, it CONTINUES TO EXIST. Which would be sufficient to
refute the idea that existence is the same as material exemplifications. That
seems obvious to me. If you wanna say things exist because they have matter,
you cannot say that a disembodied soul can exist or continue to exist; at most
you can say that such a soul has existed before, but no longer exists, if it
no longer has matter.  
Saying angels also have prime matter is okay but that'd just be another cost
for a position that seems implausible and frankly doesn't seem to accomplish
much.  
  
""As for God, His essence and existence are commonly held to be identical,
anyway.""  
  
But God is not material. So it just seems bizarre to suggest that existence
comes from prime matter.  
  
And overall, I cannot quite make sense of what you are suggesting except if we
are just calling ""Existence"" ""Matter"". In that case, the form will be the
Essence and Matter will be ""Existence"" and you have only a semantic
difference.  
  
The whole point of the Essence x Existence distinction, in a nutshell, is that
there is a real actuality that is the ""oomph"" of things existing. When you
consider a unicorn, you can understand what it is without knowing whether it
actually exists or not. This is so because its existence is not the same as
its essence. Sure, the unicorn's existence qua unicorn involves material
exemplification, but there might be things which exist without matter (as the
examples I gave), and in any case we are just trying to maintain a principle
of actuality/reality here. You seem to just be turning that principle into
matter. One could make more objections from the nature of prime matter and how
it can be changed etc., but it's not even clear to me what you're trying to
accomplish with that, and how you would avoid the arguments for a real
distinction (if you really are trying to abandon it).  
  
""What I insist is that God's Mind or Essence has multiple thoughts and
intentions which are contingent accidents - e.g. God's concept of this
universe, and His intention to make it.""  
  
But where do these accidents come from? They could only be caused by the
divine essence, but then God would just be the simple essence anyway. And it
seems impossible for the accidents to come about, since they would have to
actualize God somehow (in the way accidents actualize the subjects), but God
as pure actuality (the simple essence as you admitted) would not be able to be
actualized by accidents. To put it differently: I worry that God could only
cause himself parts if he already had parts in the first place (a potential to
receive the actuality of the accidents/be modified by the accidents), so it
would be viciously circular.  
Another worry I have is that the First Cause would already prepossess in
itself the actualities of the accidents it would cause, but then, what's the
point? And it would be the case of a something actualizing itself, which is
impossible.  
  
""an agent's choice to do something must be (at least logically, even if not
temporally) preceded by a plan or intention to do it. ""  
  
If intentions do not determine the choice, then it seems you are treating
intentions as if they were non-determining motives or predispositions. But
then the classical theist can agree that God DOES have these intentions. I
certainly believe that, at least. To me, God created this universe because he
was impressed by reasons R, and his being impressed by reasons R is not a
contingent fact, but a necessary one. God is impressed by R in every world.  
  
So what's the issue? Classical theists need not deny that God has intentions
to act. If you accept the fact that God can create different things in
different worlds without there having to be any differences in intrinsic
properties in God between these worlds as he chooses what to create (something
you should accept if you accept LFW) then what is the problem? (1/2)",4030

""However, it is a problem for God, whose intention is identical to Him.""  
  
No Walter, it is just a problem for you. It is beyond humans to understand
God. Multitudes of human words have no bearing on what God is or what He can
do. In particular, He does not obey your thought.  
  
And whatever Professor Feser or Professor Davies hold Divine simplicity to be,
it surely isn't something that leads to your conclusions. Your conclusions can
only be reached by assuming that certain ideas opposed to yours are false
without demonstration, ideas that you cannot bother to even understand.  
  
This makes your words empty and without serious force - a joke at best.

"@Walter  
An agent has a range of actions that can be actualized for some given scenario
(which provides the common intelligibility for the range of these actions).
Since the range considered in itself is indeterminate (and the scenario is
indifferent towards any one such action) the agent particularizes out of that
range to get an actual action. The particularization itself is sui generis and
only exists with some volition itself.  
  
To answer your question more directly, action A and action B are analogous to
each other with respect to the scenario in question. If the scenario is for
instance that one needs to survive, then the actions ""drink water"" and ""eat
food"" can both be said to ensure survival, but in different ways. Since
neither of these has commanding power until they are realized, the agent is
really open to both.  
  
As such, if you were somehow able to run simulations of this, you would see
the agent sometimes ""drink water"", other times ""eat food"".  
  
@RunDec  
I think it does, though I will get to what I think is a more core issue that I
think you are getting at.  
  
Volitional causation is not univocal. Because it is not univocal, you can have
different actions with no intrinsic difference across the agent (until after
the action is done). Moreover, ""X"" and ""Y"" do not have any actual individual
reality until actually caused.  
  
You only get a mystery if you already assume X or Y are already actual in the
relevant way and are univocally transmitted to the effect.",1510
"To a being existence to be a brute fact this being would need to be one that
is composed of parts. On these beings either the existence is explained by
another being or not explained by anything(a brute fact, if we suppose these
are possible). Since Being Itself is not composed of parts, them the idea that
it could have parts that are together by no reason at all, which we need to
have a brute fact, is simple unintelligible, really. We are talking of a being
whose essence just is existence, how could we have a brute fact?  
  
I would say that the modal truths merely describe this. They do say that Being
Itself has to exist, but they are not the reason.",661
"Davies is well-known for contrasting classical theism (represented by
Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas, Maimonides, Avicenna, et al.) with what he calls
the “theistic personalism” that is at least implicit in thinkers like Richard
Swinburne, Alvin Plantinga, open theists, and others. The difference between
the views is that theistic personalists reject divine simplicity and, as a
consequence, often reject other classical attributes such as immutability,
impassibility, and eternity. (Davies acknowledges that not all those he labels
“theistic personalists” agree on every important issue and that they don’t
necessarily self-identify as theistic personalists. But he’s identifying a
trend of thinking that really does exist in contemporary philosophy of
religion, even if those contributing to it do not always realize they are
doing so.)",836

"Second, Davies notes that in order to show that an eternal and immutable God’s
act of creation would be unfree, one would have to show that there is
something either internal to God’s nature or external to him that compels him
to create. But given that the divine nature is as classical theists, on
independent grounds, argue it to be (pure actuality, perfect, omnipotent,
etc.) there can be no need in God for anything distinct from him, so that
nothing in his nature can compel him to create. And since, the classical
theist also argues (and again on independent grounds) there is nothing apart
from God that God did not create, there can be nothing distinct from him that
compels him to create. Hence we cannot make sense of God’s being in any way
compelled to create, and thus must attribute freedom to him.",811
"@Talmid  
  
The same way classical theism and contingent knowledge go together. My open
theism is based on the openness of the future (I agree with Pruss and many
others that foreknowledge of free acts requires eternalism, but I am a
presentist, so I reject foreknowledge of free acts). In other words: there is
no difference at all in our views of God - I also believe that he must know
every true fact. The difference between us is that I do not believe there are
any true facts of what we will choose. Only what we choose or have chosen. So
there is nothing for God to know there.  
  
How can God ""learn"" what we choose without undergoing intrinsic change? The
same way God can learn any contingent facts without undergoing intrinsic
change. Classical theists believe God's knowledge of contingents is
externalist and involves only Cambridge changes for him. You already have to
believe that God's knowledge differs between worlds without that entailing any
change in his intrinsic properties. Even with foreknowledge you have to
believe that God only knows what you will do IFF God contingently creates you
(unless you are a Molinist - which thomists reject - or you believe God
creates of necessity). So you're on the same boat as me when it comes to
having to account for God's contingent knowledge without real change. The only
difference, again, is that I think there is nothing to know re: ""future
choices"".  
  
So no, open theism does not entail God being temporal. I wholeheartedly agree
that God is outside of time. But unlike what some (very confused) thomists
think, that does not mean that God can ""see the future"" as if there were
anything to see there (unless, again, you are an eternalist/B theorist).",1722
"Hi Ed,  
  
I respectfully put it to you that the Thomistic doctrine of Divine simplicity
you're defending here has passed its use-by date, for the following reasons:  
  
1\. It isn't taught by the Church, which merely affirms that God has “one
essence, substance, or nature absolutely simple” (Lateran IV, 1215). There's
nothing here about whether God has contingent thoughts, plans or intentions in
his capacity as Creator of the cosmos, in addition to possessing a nature
which is necessary.  
  
2\. It's totally unscriptural. The Bible depicts God as explicitly declaring,
""My thoughts [plural] are not your thoughts"" (Isaiah 55:8), in a verse
affirming Divine transcendence (which is the last place where one would expect
anthropomorphic language, so I can only assume it's literal). The Psalmist
adds: ""How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How vast is the sum
of them!"" (Psalm 139:17). Thomists, on the other hand, believe that God does
not have multiple thoughts; instead, He has only one thought, viz., His
thought of Himself, and He knows creatures by knowing Himself.  
  
3\. It's grounded in a philosophically dubious ontology: creatures are said to
be compounds of essence and existence, while God alone is an Act of Pure and
Infinite Existence, which is incapable of possessing any modifications or
attributes (such as thoughts and intentions). However, the arguments for a
real distinction between essence and existence in creatures prove no such
thing: all they prove is that matter and form are distinct (which is why I can
know what a Thylacine [or Tasmanian tiger] is, without knowing whether it
currently exists or not: I don't know for sure if its form is still
instantiated anywhere on Earth). What's more, the notion of Pure Existence is
utterly vague: it is indefinite rather than infinite. Better to say, rather,
that God is the Ultimate Yardstick of existence. He defines what it means for
us to exist, for ""in him we live, and move, and have our being"" (Acts 17:28).  
  
4\. Thomists also contend that God, the Author of nature, could have made a
different world, or no world at all, without having any different mental acts,
such as intentions. That's like an author saying, “I could have written a
totally different story, or even no story at all, without there being any
difference in my intentions.”  
  
5\. Why is there a world? The Thomist’s answer is: “Because God.” But if there
were a different world, or no world at all, the Thomist's reply would be the
same: ""Because God."" I respectfully submit that any explanation which is
elastic enough to account for BOTH the world’s occurrence AND its non-
occurrence is not doing the work of an explanation at all. It's vacuous.  
  
6\. Finally, if there's one thing Scripture is quite clear about, it is that
God is a Father. And as the doctrine of the Trinity shows, even without
creating anything, He'd still be one. That's a basic fact about God, and it
shows He's personal all the way down.",2992

Whatever they themselves suggest. Neo-theism is normally used for process
theology and open theism. But most of the people you would call neo-theists
are not into that at all.  
By 'the vast majority' I mean the vast majority of believers. Even nowadays,
the vast majority of Catholics have no notion of Divine Simplicity. They see
God indeed as a sort of superhuman who can do everything he wishes.  
I know that philosophers and theologians have a more sophisticated view of
God, but most of them do not seem to be able to free themselves from their
anthropomorphism.  
No matter how simple they claim their God, He still remains an
anthropomorphism.",664

I do not know which is older. If Irenaeus took Divine simplicity for granted
and on the basis of that rejcted gnosticism, then gnosticism seems older than
Irenaeus's belief.",185
"1- I don't care about what is taught by the Church, so I'll ignore that;  
  
2- I also don't care about what Scripture teaches;  
  
3- Aren't you getting Essence and Existence confused with Form and Matter?
Knowing whether a Tasmanian tiger exists or not is a matter of knowing whether
it has Existence or not, not what its Matter is. Sure, the existence of an
animal might require its material exemplification, but this is not the case
with immaterial beings (such as souls, angels, God, or any other candidates).
What you are pointing to is precisely the difference between Essence and
Existence - that you can know what-a-thing-is without knowing that-a-thing-is.
It's not the same as what form a thing has versus its material cause (which
also could or could not exist). I don't know what you mean by ""Pure Existence""
being vague or not infinite but Aquinas has some pretty good arguments for why
Pure Existence is infinite, divine, etc.  
  
More importantly, why are you ignoring the entire rationale for Divine
Simplicity? It seems to be a recurring thing among critics. You point apparent
problems but then ignore the arguments given for simplicity.  
  
I speak as a person who has no ulterior motives; I simply am convinced that
the First Cause of all things must be absolutely simple. If it had parts, then
it would be dependent upon those parts for its existence, and thus would not
be perfectly independent. Yet cosmological arguments require a foundation that
is entirely independent of anything, which just is necessary existence,
unconditioned. A composite is always conditioned by its parts, its existence
is always ""iffy"" and dependent on the parts. So if ""God"" had parts, the parts
would be the First Principles, not the composite. And if you follow that
along, you'll reach some really bad problems.  
And if God had an accident distinct of himself (his essence), where would this
accident come from? It can't come from the essence lest you accept the
precedence of a perfectly simple Essence which is the source of all things,
which is what you're trying to avoid. But there is nowhere for the accident to
come from, then, and being an accident, it cannot exist ""by its own (non-
substantial, hence conditioned and dependent) nature"". You know classical
authors reflected a lot on these matters and didn't just adopt Divine
Simplicity because of church teaching, right?  
  
4- And yet the same happens with libertarian freedom for us as well. Before
you make your choice, there is a point in which there is no difference in your
properties between world 1 (where you go on to choose X) and world 2 (where
you go on to not choose X). So do you reject libertarian free will for humans
too? Since I accept LFW, I already cannot accept that objection.  
  
If I had to accept it, though, I would rather embrace necessitarian
emanationism or optimism etc. than reject Simplicity, speaking for myself.  
  
5- This objection wouldn't just cut against Divine Simplicity; it would also
cut against creation being the result of a free choice, given what I said in
4. And you seem to be presupposing that an explanans must determine the
explanandum, which is very doubtful (especially if it would cost us standard
free will explanations);  
  
6- Again, don't care about what Scripture says in philosophical matters
(philosophy and rational argument always comes first to me) but Divine
Simplicity isn't incompatible with God being personal. God *is* personal, and
literally so, since he is the ultimate source of personhood. He's just
eminently personal by virtue of a greater perfection (a single one) which
includes the actualities of all others in a unified way.",3680
"""The vast majority of people have been 'neo'-theists as long as anyone can
remember.""  
  
Not the vast majority of theologians and philosophers, though. Which is what
is most interesting for philosophical discussions of theism, I think. So I
think ""neo-theism"" is a good label.  
  
I do not find it condescending at all. Sure, there are some smug classical
theists who fail to properly consider the arguments and motivations of neo-
theists, but in academia the discussion is pretty civil. I don't know of a
better term to use. ""Theistic personalism"" is horrible and misinforming; it
gives the idea that classical theists think God isn't personal, which is not
true. It also doesn't help that it uses the same name as the philosophical
movement that Karol Wojtyla was a part of - thomistic personalism, etc.

experts), and works. What better name would you suggest? Parts theism?",960

"@Anonymous @Talmid According to Judaism and the first ecumenical council the
Catholic Church ever held, eating meat from animals that have been abused is a
mortal sin, of the same gravity as fornication or idolatry.  
  
""You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, **from the meat
of strangled animals** and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid
these things. Farewell."" - St. James the Just (Acts 15:29)  
  
Practically speaking, because almost all forms of mass farming in the United
States are far more abusive than the relatively tame practice of merely
strangling animals of Ancient Rome, this means that anyone who knowingly buys
meat from a mass farm or mass food supplier like Sysco (via a restaurant),
knowing what the first church council wrote, with full consent of the will,
has committed a mortal sin. In order to avoid falling into mortal sin, you
must eat vegan whenever you eat out (or reduce animal product intake as much
as possible) or buy animal products only from Kosher or Halal delis (because
Jews and Muslims still hold fast to these rules). Or if you yourself or anyone
in your immediate family is a farmer, you have to use traditional ways of
killing an animal.",1219
"God can have all the necessary reasons to create in every possible world. And
he knows these reasons by knowing himself.  
  
If your problem is that you think these reasons have to be literal, existing
separate things in the divine mind (and they cannot be identified with each
other) then the problem isn't with divine creative freedom per se, but rather
with the status of the multiplicity of divine ideas (""and 2 must be different
from 5!""). That is a different problem. Speaking for myself it's not clear to
me that divine ideas must literally exist as separate entities; the nature of
knowledge and how (it seems to me) it's basically a ""transparent"" power
whereby something is grasped by the knower and understood through itself seems
to me compatible with God knowing different abstract facts by means of a
single known concrete substance which is analyzed (a substance that happens to
be the ground of all possibilia anyway, God), though I cannot hope to imagine
it. I think what Dolezal has written on the divine ideas would also be very
helpful here.  
  
Thus God's personhood is grounded in impersonal notions like ""being"" and
""act"": for Thomists, these are what God is, primarily""  
  
This misses the point. The point at that stage is precisely that ""being"" and
""act"" are NOT impersonal. Intelligence is an irreducible aspect of existence
which some beings (like us) enjoy when they're not limited enough. God's
personhood is not grounded in anything impersonal (that would be absurd);
existence in its fullness is taken to be irreducibly personal. It's impersonal
beings that just happen to be limited enough that they are unable to possess
that dimension of being, so to speak. As the ultimate source of personhood and
the unlimited actuality of the principle that is the basis of personhood, God
is personal through and through.

The choice to do X is different from the choice to do ~X because the effects
are different, but if Libertarian Freedom is to work, the two effects could
indeterministically come about from the same cause without any difference of
intrinsic properties in it. If there was a difference which was associated
only with X (and another with ~X) then that would entail that the agent would
have already chosen either X or ~X, since he would have the corresponding

choosing.  
  
Again: you at t in state S can cause either X or ~X. Do you not see how this

If in order to cause X you had to be in S1 and to cause ~X you had to be in
S2, then if you were in S1 you would not be able to cause ~X, and hence would

chose strawberry ice cream because I like strawberry ice cream, but this
explanation does not determine my choice (otherwise it wouldn't have been a
libertarian free choice). The explanans need not determine the explanandum. I
could have chosen chocolate ice cream instead, and yet it would still be true
that I like strawberry ice cream. Likewise, God created our universe because
he was impressed by how our universe would be good (whatever reasons R), and R
could be necessary and he could be impressed by R in every world, without R
determining his choice to create. R are motivating reasons for a choice.

"Finally, Davies emphasizes that “to speak of God as simple is not to attribute
a property to God but to deny certain things when it comes to God” (p. 179).
Here, as he has in other work, Davies emphasizes the idea that the ascription
of attributes to God should be understood as an exercise in _negative_ or
_apophatic_ theology. The main arguments for classical theism, he points out,
emphasize both that the world is contingent or conditioned in various
respects, and that an ultimate explanation of the world must be _un_
conditioned and _non_ -contingent in those respects. (Though, just in case he
wouldn’t himself use it, I should note that the language of “conditioned” and
“unconditioned” in this context is mine, not Davies’.) In particular, God must
_not_ be changeable, must _not_ have properties that are distinct from each
other or from him, and so on. This is what it means to characterize him as
simple. But by the same token, he must _not_ be compelled to create by
anything either internal to his nature or outside of him. Hence divine
simplicity, divine freedom, and the relationship between them are properly
understood as characterizations of what God is _not_.",1181
"""It may matter for LFW where that Will came from, but it doesn't matter for my
argument.""  
  
How does it not matter for your argument, if whether or not the model counts
as LFW depends on it? Of course if there is such a thing as this ""Will"" which
determinately lead to vanilla rather than chocolate, we must be the ones to
cause such a Will. Otherwise, again, we are in no control whatsoever of our
actions - a Will just emerges (uncaused by us, hence beyond our choice or
control) which then causes our actions. Of course it matters for your
argument, since if your model is unacceptable for libertarian freedom
proponents then it won't work as a defense against my claim (that LFW for
humans already involves the issue of an agent being able to cause 2 distinct
effects without a change in intrinsic properties).  
  
""What matters is that there is a Will to do X. And a will to do X is not thé
same as a Will to do not X.""  
  
And the problem - to repeat myself again - is that if we are to maintain
libertarian freedom, we have to have caused this Will. Otherwise the Will-
for-X just emerges beyond our control and determines that we do X, and this is
no libertarian freedom.  
  
But if we cause the Will-to-X we cannot require a further, second order Will-
to-will-to-X, otherwise we end up in a regress. That's been my point for a
while now. So it turns out that this ""Will"" isn't really required for our
choices. It's a confused notion that would lead to an infinite, vicious
regress.  
  
The existence of a Will-to-X becomes superfluous, since even on the assumption
that it exists we must be able to choose and cause it (or the Will-to-not-X)
without requiring a further second order Will. So it turns out this ""Will"" is
not really required for free actions. In the end, LFW requires that an agent
be able to choose and cause X or ~X without a difference in intrinsic

""The problem of evil (or suffering) does not say that there should not be so
much evil or suffering if Christian doctrine is true, it says that the
existence of (so much) evil or suffering is incompatible with a tri-omni God
and hence Christian doctrine, along with other doctrines about God, is false.""  
  
And does not the role that christian doctrine puts suffering into at least
make the argument lose force?  
  
Atheist: ""there is no way that a perfect deity and the evil on this world
could coesist"".  
  
Christian: ""And what if such and such is true?""  
  
I mean, it just amazes me how at least my suffering seems justified on this
worldview*, i consider it a philosophical and existential advantage that
christianity has against generic theism and judaism and islam.  
  
At least the logical problem of evil seems weaker by the sheer existence of
this faith.

"Hi Ficino! All is well. Great to see you. I really miss the old days on the
classical theism forum. I'm thinking of starting another classical theism
community--just wondering if Ed would be okay with me shamelessly plugging it
in the com boxes here from time to time.",268
"""I think it would be closer to say that you completely misunderstand, since
almost all of what you say is tangential, not contradictory, to what I said""  
  
Well, it seemed to me that you had reduced relevant moral norms to customs and
a ""framework of human practices and institutions"", and I strongly disagree
with that. That human suffering is (ceteris paribus, to avoid soul-building
considerations) something lamentable is a necessary truth, for example.  
  
""But you are evidently fatally deceived as to the meaning of that term, since
you believe (apparently?!) that creatures ""come to possess"" these same eminent
perfections when they are perfected""  
  
They do not come to possess the same exact thing univocally (which in God
would only be one perfection), but whatever they actuality come to possess
must be pre-contained within God in at least the same degree or in a greater
way. As such, every actuality in our ""moral agency"" must be present in God,
and *not* in an inferior way. Every actuality, not every limitation. If God
possessed our perfection of Intellect in a way that made him unable to know
things, that would be absurd. It would be inferior. If God possessed our
perfection of moral agency in such a way that he could not know moral truths
(""rape is wrong"", ""human suffering is ceteris paribus bad and to be avoided"",
etc) and could not act in accordance with moral truths or practical judgment,
then it would be an inferior actuality. Which would be absurd.  
  
So you are turning the discussion into something else - I never said anything
that was incompatible with analogy, for instance; I was even quite explicit in
saying that God's formal possession of our perfections (again, see Garrigou-
Lagrange for example) does not deny analogy. And you are missing the point
that if moral agency is a pure perfection (like wisdom is), then it is also
proper to say God is a moral agent. Except if you wanna reject that God is
wise, perhaps.  
  
But if God did not know you existed or that you and I were having this
conversation, this would certainly be a problem and he would not be ""God"" in
the way that believers take him to be. And not in the sense that believers
might have mistaken views of God (thinking he has real parts for instance, or
is changing or whatever), but in a sense that would make most of them conclude
that God would (absurdly) be seriously defective, and not worthy of worship at
all.  
  
It's not that hard, actually. If God is indifferent to (e.g.) a child being
tortured to the point where he could simply not bother to do anything to stop
or prevent it, when it is in his power to do so, then God would be seriously
defective, unimpressive and unworthy of love and worship.  
  
In which case he would not be God, as God is supposed to be.  
  
But then God cannot be indifferent to that kind of stuff, i.e. prima facie, if
God exists, he should be stopping or preventing these evils, unless he has
morally sufficient reasons for not doing so (and then we're back to standard
theodicy, skeptical theism, etc. Which us theists cannot avoid.)",3096

It seems to me, Walter, that the proposition:

atractive to God than one were no evil, natural or moral, ever happened thanks
to the more types of goods that exist on it

"""For my part, I think it's best to honestly acknowledge that some evil in this
world is indeed gratuitous and senseless, and that there are some dark
recesses of the human psyche which God Himself cannot reach: He can console us
while we're in pain, but not while we're in agony, as that severs the
communication channels. In some cases, then, we meet God only on the other
side.""  
  
That seems to severely limit omnipotence, and just the divine power in
general. How is it that God cannot help these people in desperate need?
Especially since he's still the creator of all and has to maintain everything
going, to suggest that he cannot stop a torturer in any way or talk to someone
in their moment of agony seems ridiculous.  
  
Even worse, some people are capable of helping those in need and comforting
them in death. But God can't? I can do something that this God can't, like
that? This is not God, this is some type of friendly alien-parent I have no
intention to worship (although I would be interested in still being friends
with him, more as equals)  
  
And if God cannot help these people at that time of need, how could we even
trust him to be able to help them AFTER death? If anything it just makes it
less likely. He wasn't able to do anything when people were alive, now
suddenly he's gonna be able to help them after death? That seems implausible.  
  
What we need is full-blooded rationalist theodicy coupled with skeptical
theism. There are some morally sufficient reasons for why God allows so many
horrors for a finite time here, and they may well be beyond our understanding.
But God must have his reasons, and he also is capable of compensating for
everything in (perhaps) heaven, an infinite afterlife, etc.  
  
Having to hold that there are morally sufficient reasons for all the evil is
certainly a bad cost, but it's still the best cost (at least in my judgment).
Better than limiting God so much or embracing atheism (both seem more
problematic to me)",1985
"@Talmid: My condition for the “necessary” is ‘in order to achieve God’s plan’.
We can of course only see that very dimly indeed, but it’s clear that the “new
heaven and earth” will be more like the creation that people who reject God
because of theodicy issues would expect of a good God. No more working in
vain, no more pain of witnessing your children's misfortune. The wolf and the
lamb eat together, even the lion no longer eats other creatures. So it seems
clear to me from revelation that these things are a necessary phase of
creation. When God creates he says it’s “good”, even though He knew it would
contain elements that would not be part of the second creation. Once we were
consciously able to choose between Him and not-Him, we often chose the latter.
However it’s in making this choice correctly when it’s not obvious or easy
that we ‘grow up’, as in we become as our Father intended.  
  
Now I agree with you that we can imagine universes where we would be free and
where we could easily see what is right, where there is no suffering of us or
others to make us ‘loose heart’, and where there are no bright and shiny false
lights with temporary excitement and pleasure. However, like the vines planted
in good, loamy soil, which produce great big bunches of grapes but poor wine,
there is clearly a need for us to struggle a bit in an apparently sub optimal
environment for the creation process to have a successful end point. How God
knows that, we cannot know. Did He tune creation like a quantum experiment,
with all possible realities happening, and from eternity selected the one that
worked best? Or did He just know, because He is infinite and absolute in all
things? I suspect the latter, but the point is that we see a very small part
of the creation process. The people who have the most issue with it nearly
always think the process is complete, and that is their downfall.",1902
"Walter,  
  
I don't think I understand your response. I did not mean to suggest that God
could not have stopped the Fall (if ""the Fall"" happened; I was just using that
as an example) with sheer power, but rather that a world like ours in which
the Fall happened might be better than a world in which the Fall never
happened. Or that, from the point of view of perfect rationality, one should
not have attempted to prevent the Fall. It seems to me that there are many
possible reasons, even beyond our ken, for why God could not have prevented
the Fall without some immorality, or perhaps without sacrificing a greater
good that could morally justify his inaction.  
  
I do not deny that there is a plausibility to thinking that, prima facie, if
God existed, the world should look a lot better than it is. Speaking for
myself, I think it raises the probability of atheism to some degree, but I
find it very hard to go beyond a prima facie impression here. It seems the
problem of evil would require us to adopt a ""God's eye"" point of view that I
don't think people can reliably have (I certainly can't have it, at the
moment). I am not even sure enough about everything in morality. There are
moral dillemas that I am unsure about, for example.  
  
And while it strikes me as absolutely obvious that (e.g.) having an innocent
person being tortured forever for no reason would be necessarily horrible, and
the kind of thing that God/a perfect being could not do or be okay with, I am
not at all sure about (and even see some plausibility in) theodicies where
suffering builds a person's character (perhaps even in heaven, looking back?)
and could contribute to a better end-state in the world and the victim will be
in heaven in eternal happiness, etc.  
  
I do not think that we can reliably have a ""God's eye"" point of view for the
evils in the world to confidently say that a perfect being couldn't have
permitted them, or that there could be no morally justifiable plan behind it,
etc. I know that God (if God exists) could not be indifferent to them or not-
intervening for no good reason. But I do not know enough to confidently say
that there can be no reason for it all. To put it differently, I am not
confident that there isn't a working theodicy out there, between heaven and
earth, beyond my knowledge. And I think you shouldn't be confident, either",2363

It's again not at all clear what your actual point of disagreement is here. I
was just pointing out that human morality is obviously radically conditioned
in a way that divine morality is not and cannot be. And it is absurd to bring
to bear the (your) standards of human moral agency to attempt to critique what
(little) you understand to be God's exercise of his moral agency. It's like
thinking you can get a better look at the sun by shining a flashlight towards

“ Notice that the main goal is to avoid serious suffering, not to cherish it.”  
  
I think you’re confusing different types of suffering. Often people don’t

perspective of physical health. However we generally make the choice there, we
understand how it helps our health. What about a young child forced not to
ride it’s tricycle on a busy road, or to take some bad tasting medicine. In
these cases most children don’t understand the end good. A few children may
trust their parents, and so for them (and there parents!) it’s not really a
problem. For others, the hurt and pain they feel at the unfairness of it all
often causes them far more problems than the bad taste or the limited cycling
options.

You are using imprecise language. We are Catholics here, not calvinists;

So what you are saying is in fact, that is better to not exist at all than to
exist and be condemned; I never asked him, but if you have the chance to ask
the devil, who condemned himself of his own free-will and is condemned for all
eternity, if he prefers to exist and be condemned to not exist at all; I am

fallen world of suffering, who would eventually die and be tormented forever.

*their* existence would bring about, not come into existence at all. So if you
have say, a direct ancestor that is condemned you would rather that God had
not brought him to existence, and thus not bring you to existence, than bring
him to existence and allow him to fall. And you call this ""loving""? Right.",1183

others find themselves in the same state although enjoying all the pleasures

many early Christians gave up the faith when threatened with persecution but
this doesn't detract from the greatness of the sacrifice of so many others. If
one cannot put up a coherent case against the Christian understanding of
suffering, original sin and Redemption, it does not do much good to think
forever and gloomily about suffering. The effort would be better spent

of original justice are not in a merely natural state, according to St.

perfect nature [state of nature]; secondly, in the state of corrupted nature.
Now in the state of perfect nature, man, without habitual grace, could avoid
sinning either mortally or venially; since to sin is nothing else than to
stray from what is according to our nature - and in the state of perfect
nature man could avoid this... But in the state of corrupt nature man needs
grace to heal his nature in order that he may entirely abstain from sin"".",1317

"@Talmid. Well said. As an ex-atheist, I know that whether you believe in God
as the ground of being (as all real believers do), versus considering Him as
“a being” (as most atheists do) affects so much of your perspective. It’s not
a fact among other facts. The reality is more like our understanding is a
wall, with boxed up bricks of conclusions. As humans we find it difficult to
look at the contents of more than one brick at a time. From an evolutionary
perspective this is understandable. When you need food, or there is a lion at
the cave entrance, you don’t want to be thinking about ways to make clothes,
how the sun moves through the sky etc. In the modern world the foundations of
the wall tend to be physics, chemistry, maths, geology, economics, politics
etc, which themselves have foundations built on a reduction to small things
(pebbles). Once you believe in God, that is always the foundation stone. To me
this is why literalist, fundamentalist protestants have such a problem with
science, but that’s a different subject. However it’s also why people find the

"""If the tree of life was necessary for Adam and Eve to live forever, one might
reasonably ask, did animals have access to the tree of life? The answer seems
to be no.  
  
If the tree of life was unique, it might have been enough for Adam and Eve to
eat from, but it would never have been enough for all of the animals of the
world to eat from. This may be another sign that the animals were not
understood to have the tree of life for their food. If so, then the text of
Genesis itself would suggest that, while man was meant to be immortal, animals
were not. That would support the idea, based on St. Paul’s statement, that it
was human death that entered the world through the Fall, not animal death.  
  
Furthermore, we should note that giving “every green plant” to animals as food
does not mean that some of them weren’t also carnivores. It’s not as if,
before original sin, lions ate dandelions and toadstools and only afterward
did they begin picking on poor old wildebeest. This is something Thomas
Aquinas wrote about in his Summa Theologica:  
  
In the opinion of some, those animals which now are fierce and kill others,
would, in that state, have been tame, not only in regard to man, but also in
regard to other animals. But this is quite unreasonable. For the nature of
animals was not changed by man’s sin, as if those whose nature now it is to
devour the flesh of others, would then have lived on herbs, as the lion and
falcon.

in the face of modern evolutionary theory, that Thomas wrote these words
nearly 550 years prior to the birth of Charles Darwin.)""",1659

"Many today labor under the delusion that the reality of suffering is a
difficulty for Christianity – as if Christian doctrine would lead us to expect
little or no suffering, so that its adherents should be flummoxed by
suffering’s prevalence. As I have discussed in previous articles, this is the
reverse of the truth. The Catholic faith teaches that suffering [is the
inexorable consequence](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2021/09/the-first-
world-problem-of-evil.html) of original sin and past actual sin. [It is an
essential part](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2022/05/nietzsche-and-christ-
on-suffering.html) of the long and painful process of sanctification, of
overcoming sinful habits of thought and action. It is the inevitable
concomitant of the persecution Christians must face for preaching the Gospel
and condemning the world’s wickedness. It is an inescapable punishment for
sin, which we must embrace in a penitential spirit. By way of suffering we pay
both our own temporal debt and that of others for whom we might offer up our
suffering. By way of it we most closely unite ourselves to Christ’s Passion.
The extent and depth of human suffering thus _confirms_ rather than
disconfirms the claims of Christianity.",1233

suffering. For instance, would you rather we, suppose we could, put all savage

don’t often call it suffering, such as going for a run every week (assuming
like me you don’t particularly like running, but like the end results). Or
vacuuming the house, packing the dishwasher etc.  
  
For many reasons we usually consider these to be categorically different from
suffering. We choose to do them, the downsides are very mild, the benefits are
obvious and immediate etc. However in principle they are very similar. They
are also similar in that the more we learn to accept them - even to try
inwardly celebrate the service we are giving to the final cause, the less they
become problems.",857
"There are many horrendous evils that a loving father God should prevent/stop,
and should be able to. For example, many cases of horrendous suffering caused
by some diseases; sexual abuse and torture; etc. The list could go on and on.
And Christians do believe that God does, in fact, sometimes prevent or stop
said evils through (for example) miracles or providence. So it is a problem
why there are still so many of these evils going on and our loving Father does
nothing about it - not even when people desperately or earnestly pray and beg
him for help.  
  
""And how could God prevent the evils in the world without also preventing the
wonderful goods that accidentally give rise to them or to which by Divine
mercy they lead?""  
  
I do not know with certainty that God could do that. But it does seem like
there are many cases of seemingly gratuitous, horrible evil - which God should
therefore prevent or stop. And again, Christians do believe that God does that
in some cases, too (either through miracle or providence). So the problem
seems pressing to me.  
  
I believe in God, so in the end I do think that there is some greater good
that is achieved with God not-intervening, or allowing this universe to just
be full of suffering and horror for some time, etc. I hope there is a morally
sufficient reason for it all and that the Form of the Good (God) is not so
distant from our love, hopes and needs. But this is a serious epistemic cost -
because when I look at the world, it does seem like there are purely
gratuitous horrendous evils, or that God should be doing better, and so on.
It's a bad epistemic cost, one that I wish I could avoid, and it makes me
think that some people truly are reasonable in their position of atheism. I
personally just happen to find theism to be harder to deny, rationally
speaking, so I think it offsets the problem of evil in the end. But I think
it's a serious problem and we don't have a simple solution to it either in
philosophy or religion.

"I agree that some instances of suffering that happen in the world does indeed
help us to realise and understand the goodness of God. It manifests his
goodness in so far as his mercy is enough to restore even the most broken of
souls and we do see examples of this. The way in which God has arranged things
does give way to a lot of instances where he brings a greater good out of all
the evil that is taken place, the most stark example being the crucifixion
which God used to manifest his infinite mercy. Pope John Paul II as well as
Thomas Aquinas have both referred to God's mercy has his greatest attribute,
that attribute which displays his goodness in the greatest way since God is
below no one. And to top it all it was implemented by means of an Incarnation.
All these great goods would not have been possible to us in a world without
sin even if an Incarnation had taken place in that world because God's mercy
would have been conceivable to us only by contemplating the act of creation
which would be very abstract. In this world his mercy was on its fullest
display. We deserved punishment but God gave us the opposite.  
Having said all that though, I think these instances serve to show us that God
can indeed bring greater goods out of great evils and we can trust him in that
regard. They form parts of the reason why God has permitted suffering. And
it's true in a general sense. At the same time there are such ghastly acts
that humans commit, that it's hard to believe that God allowed that person to
suffer like that just because doesn't want that person to get attached to this
world, it's even worse to propose that it was deserved as punishment. In such
cases solace should be derived from the fact that even such ghastly trauma can
be healed by God's mercy and at the same time refrain from attributing any
reason to God for permitting it since we truly aren't in a position to know
why. God himself points to our cluelessness in the book of Job. In previous
posts on suffering Prof usually did underscore this point regarding particular
cases atleast up untill last years Christmas message where he posited that we
can't fathom why God has permitted the crisis in church to go on for so long.

"@Walter and anon. I’m deliberately using necessary in a way that will not be
popular here. I think a huge amount of time and credibility is wasted on
arguing whether God had choice in something. Pretty much all of those
arguments are meaningless. There are some realities God could have brought
forth that we can sort of imagine, say that there are two temporal dimensions
and four spatial dimensions. Really tricky to actually get your head around,
but we have at least some ability to do so. There are others where we just
incapable of even imagining. To argue about God’s choices is therefore
meaningless unless he revealed something about it.  
  
When I use necessary here, I mean it purely in that it seems necessary in
order to achieve God’s plan, which is at least in part to create children who
choose to be as like Him, and can therefore participate with Him in the
Trinity. That is an astounding thing, a top down view of the telos of the
universe.  
  
Arguing what is necessary from a bottom up perspective in the way that
philosophers tend to, in terms of what God could and could not do, is like
ants on a cathedral wall arguing about the cathedral’s architecture and
construction. Yes they are builders themselves and so know something of
building, but it’s several orders of magnitude higher in it’s nature than ants
are capable of conceiving. So if Brunelleschi was able to hear the ants

"@ Walter Van den Acker,  
  
Original sin was the fall of creation and suffering was the consequence of
this fall. We are all in this fallen creation. No one is being ""punished"", not
even Adam and Eve. They just inevitably chose sin given free will and time.
Human free will can also be modelled by an infinite unbiased random binary
sequence so all choices exist in it somewhere (as simple a model as you are
likely to find). Adam and Eve, in time, chose to leave temporal paradise and
enter the fallen creation. Knowledge of good and evil meant a return to
temporal paradise was gone without the intervention of God to bring them to
the new creation, the eternal (outside of time) paradise with God.  
  
This is where we are, all of us, people, babies, good people, bad people,
dogs, ticks, mosquitos, and viruses. There is only one creation (simplicity
again). We are all in it together. God did not cause multiple worlds for each
to choose, and by the choice define right and wrong (for you are the one
claiming to redefine things, not me). As a human with an infinite component to
your mind, since you are free, you can always choose your own way to stay
separate from God. In eternity (outside of time), when the new creation
replaces this one, choosing will no longer be possible, so if you have elected
to be separate from God, you will stay separate from God.  
  
The world we live in is not so by necessity. It could have been anything
(modelled by the random sequence). It could have been a world in which 1+ 1 is
3 and the rules of logic could have been anything. But the world we live in is
the way it is because of love. Love, not necessity. Love is why after
inevitably (given endless time) exiting temporal paradise, there is still
Salvation if you freely choose it. The innocent, even mosquitos (which are
actually rather beautiful) will have an appropriate room in God's eternal
mansion, where the leopard lies down with the kid and the suckling child plays

week. He ordered him to go forth and multiply. Since man was living with a
living seed, he sowed this seed in his wife. So he generated man, as the
Scripture says: 'Adam generated Seth. Seth generated Enos. Enos generated

"“ Psalm 50:11: I know all the birds of the mountains; And the wild beasts of

Where suffering of animals is as part of nature, we must trust that to God.
Life could not have evolved without suffering, and we must trust that the rich
tapestry of dark and light is perfectly rounded in the end. “All is well” as
He told Julian of Norwich. This is just faith in God’s goodness, and I have
confidence that the great suffering of animals in nature will make be a
necessary part of a perfect plan when we see things as they are.  
  
Where it’s caused by humans, we are responsible. We each are called to play
our part in reducing the suffering of others, as far as we are able. I can’t
judge a poor person who overworks a donkey to build a house, or buys factory
farmed meat, but those who can afford to support better welfare and always
choose the cheapest/cruelest must be at least partly responsible for the
cruelty.  
  
It’s similar with children. We can’t see God’s full plan, but we know that
life is short for all of us next to eternity. We can only play our part in
reducing it where we can, and trust the rest to God.  
  
As Augustine alludes to, some who have suffered the most can become the
purest, most loving people you could meet. Others become hard and cruel. God
is refining us like “silver in the furnace”. If we go with the process as he
asks us to, and most of the saints actually welcome suffering in themselves,
we have good reason to believe that it’s to our benefit in the long run. Most
difficult of course is when it’s others suffering, especially those we love.
But it’s exactly the same in that we can do what we can to help (including
righteous anger in the very rare cases where that is the right response), but
must do all we can to avoid becoming hard and cruel ourselves in response.
Difficult as it may be, we must trust. We must try to see that what is sharp
and apparently meaningless in the moment, is very different from the widest
perspective.

Lady of Sorrows”. Which is why the modern “I don’t believe in God because of

Participating in the Trinity ""inspires an awe and fear that is well beyond

way. And that is the point, a good God who cares about His creation would
create every conscious being with the ability to be in His presence without so
much awe and fear. Why would a good being even inspire fear on anyone?  
This ""awe and fear"" thing is a projection of emotions inspired by human
leaders who indeed ruled by awe and fear. it is also inspired by theodicies
that existed from very near the beginning, and it also inspired lots of Saints
with a (IMO) perverse attarction to suffering. Sure, most Saints believed and
still believe that suffering is necessary for unity with God for the same
reason that you believe it.

"_Accordingly this seems to me to be one principal reason why the good are

well as the wicked, though not equally with them, love this present life;
while they ought to hold it cheap, that the wicked, being admonished and
reformed by their example, might lay hold of life eternal... For so long as
they live, it remains uncertain whether they may not come to a better mind.

Well, we can't. I do call Him Goodness Itself and other cool names, though.  
  
A essencial part of this christian theodicy* is that God has a relation with
morality totally diferent than our own, see for instance the fact that He can
judge people, can kill people, can pester people until they want to do His
thing(see Jonah) etc. The Book of Job lets this clear when God finally
appears, for Job is trying to tread God as a equal the whole time, who needs
to explain His actions to him and all that, and when He finally appears He
makes very clear that Job treatment of Him as how we would do a normal person
is completely ridiculous.  
  
So the idea that God is good yes but on a more analogical than univocal way is
not a clever apologetical invention but is there on the religions of the book
since the beginning. It just sounds bizarre to me to see someone argue
otherwise, specially when the ""the names Scripture uses to talk of God should
not be understood as exactly what they mean in us"" is a thing since the church
fathers.  
  
This is important, for if God goodness is not exactly our own them His
priorities can be diferent. And, well, on the christian worldview the struggle
a believer has to be become holy, the life and struggles of the animals etc
are goods that let the universe better.  
  
Notice that even we can see value in something that requires suffering. For
instance, would you rather we, suppose we could, put all savage animals in
zoos and other controlated environments and make the ecosistems that exist now
stay functioning artificially or you would want to also let places were there
are animals living like they do and only interfere to not let extinctions and

criticism until an opportune moment, or refrain from it out of a reasonable
fear of doing more harm than good. But he teaches here that it is _not_
justifiable to refrain from such criticism merely because it is difficult, or
because we fear causing offense and losing friends, or because we don’t want
to risk losing status or other worldly goods. For the wicked are in danger _of
damnation_ if they do not repent, and we “wickedly blind ourselves” if we
shirk our duty to encourage them to do so. Even if we avoid damnation
ourselves, we will justly suffer alongside them when divine providence visits
_this-worldly_ punishments upon them (social and economic disorder, natural

This awe and fear of being in God’s presence is not something he inspires,
it’s His infinite greatness perceived by a finite creature. It’s the shock of
reality unveiled. From behind the veil, at times He spills over such that we
can experience a diluted form of His presence where words like gentle, tender,
love, peace etc are used. For now we only see dimly, our perception is
naturally tuned to dim reality, and so it’s in this diluted form that most of
us can distinguish anything other than infinite ‘brightness’.  
  
In general you take a position that conflicts with everything revealed in
scripture. So where do you get your information on what God is, what God could
do and couldn’t do? If it’s just reason, then what makes you think you can
understand the timeless and the infinite? We can’t even think without time. If
you ignore revelation, what makes you think humans are able to understand such
things any more than ants can understand Special Relativity?  
  
When Jesus Bar Joseph was convicted, Pilate gave the people the option to
choose between him and Jesus Barabbas (“son of the father”). Two messianic
figures representing two different human perspectives, one human, one divine.
Peter originally saw Jesus as the human version, and Jesus responded with “Get
thee behind me Satan”.  
  
This is made clearer by the three temptations that Jesus was given in the
desert. Satan did not ask for worship, as he is more sly than that. He
presented different versions of this human perspective, which relate to
suffering, power, and image (being liked or admired). Satan even quotes
scripture, the master theologian using scripture to sell the human
perspective.  
  
This is what spiritual discernment is all about. You can use Ignatian
exercises to help with this, you can go on silent retreat (even into the

existed before the fall (original justice), they had many other advantages as
well, like not dying. The fall made quite a difference to the state of men as

You write:  
  
As Augustine says, there isn’t “any evil [that] happens to the faithful and
godly which cannot be turned to profit,” so that, with St. Paul, “we know that
all things work together for good to them that love God” (Romans 8:28).  
  
I have to say that Augustine's remark sounds very Pollyanna-ish. There are
some evils which can only be described as soul-breaking, rather than soul-
making. Three which come to mind are rape, mutilation and torture. These are
horrendous sufferings which serve no ""greater good,"" and which can destroy
even a good individual's faith, as the following account of the 17th century
""torture in the pit"" illustrates:  
  
https://sspx.org/en/news-events/news/real-life-silences-character  
  
There were priests, many of them good men, who apostasized. What good was
served?  
  
You also cite Augustine to support the following claim: ""We cannot achieve
happiness in the world to come if we become too attached to the world that is,
and suffering is a means of preventing the latter.""  
  
This might explain some of the suffering that befalls adults, but it fails to
explain the death and suffering of a child, who has no worldly attachments.  
  
Finally, original sin (or the fall of Adam) is said to be the ultimate
explanation for why humans are permitted to suffer and die, rather than
enjoying immortality and bliss. I am not persuaded that a dumb choice by a
distant ancestor makes it fair for us to be allowed to suffer soul-breaking
evils of the sort described above, but let that pass. What original sin cannot
explain is the fact that people (e.g. political prisoners, psychiatric
patients) have been beaten or tortured to death, while screaming for Divine
deliverance or at least some Divine consolation (i.e. a sense of ""I am with
you"") at the moment of death, and in many cases, it never arrives: they die in
agony and desolation. Spiritual abandonment at the hour of death is the most
difficult evil of all to make sense of, and if you can make any sense of it,
Ed, you're a better man than I.  
  
For my part, I think it's best to honestly acknowledge that some evil in this
world is indeed gratuitous and senseless, and that there are some dark
recesses of the human psyche which God Himself cannot reach: He can console us
while we're in pain, but not while we're in agony, as that severs the
communication channels. In some cases, then, we meet God only on the other
side. Cheers.",2458

where our overcoming of difficulties are in a way more valuable because of the
difficulties. Without decay physical reality would be a disgusting mess,
without suffering our bodies could not have evolved. If you see the physical
world as everything, and our physical existence as the peak of some very lucky
random circumstances over time, as I did as an atheist, then the idea of this
physical universe as a phase of an essentially spiritual creation process
makes no sense at all. So instead you decide that a good God would instead
just create something like angels in a paradise, and not bother with the often
messy physical universe and human beings at all. Which seems to me to loose a

Well, the christian does have the example of the saints, whose suffering and
hardships make their lifes noble and interesting* not only to us but even to
themselves. To a christian, suffering is supposed to be seen not as a crappy
thing, but as a way of uniting with Christ and climbing the latter to being
similar to Him.  
  
Not only on they but on normal people, perhaps even on your case, you can see
people who look at terrible times they had and see their better situation as
enobled or even justified by the bad times. This even on totally secular
contexts, not considering the beatific vision(who would turn everything
acceptable to the receiver).  
  
This actually seems probably a very alien thinking to a modern unbeliever,

like St. Augustine. Perhaps it help. Likely not, for it is quite a jump.

way to trying to see how God could see things that way. The same God that do a
lot of things we humans cant do, like kill people and all that.

"I think people sometimes take original sin too much like a theory of physics.
Once you do that it can lead to misunderstandings. Perhaps think of it instead
as God creating nature with a telos, in fact a hierarchy of teloi, with
everything drawn towards his divine idea(l)s (using Augustines terms). What
the fall represents is us starting to choose our own sub-teloi, of having
“knowledge” of what is “good” for us. Once we do the conscious choosing, we
generally do a pretty bad job of it, as can be seen immediately with Cain, and
that has consequences that ripple across everything. Like a stone thrown into
a calm pond.  
  
In order to recover our correct place in nature so that we can become
participants in God’s original creation, working with him rather that towards
our own faulty choice of sub-telos, we have to aim towards God’s original
idea(l) of man.  
  
Fortunately He has helped us hugely here. The incarnation was not just(!) the
sacrifice that gained the reconciliation of the consequences of our bad
choices, it also gave us the perfect example of the divine ideal we were
created to be. So in choosing to be more like him, as far as we can in our
puny efforts, we become participants in God’s great act of creation that is
this universe (and we get help in this). On this path even the delights of the
world become good, and we can have life to the full (though not without
suffering yet).  
  
If we don’t - but rather continue to create our own sub-teloi - then even good
intentions can lead us away from completion, away from union with the creator.
For those whose chosen teloi, their highest good and highest desires, are the
base pleasures of the world, it is them who are choosing eternal torment. We
are made to rest in Him, not in base things which will always bring their own
suffering.

""it is possible to inevitably choose something?""  
  
Yes Walter. In the temporal paradise nothing would end it except a voluntary
exit (freely choosing to turn away from the presence of God). So an infinitude
of time was available, unmarred by fear, aging, or death.  
  
Now let us look at the simple model of human free will in time (in the
temporal paradise) - an infinite sequence of unbiased bits, in which lies all
possible intelligible choices encoded one way or other (you, Walter, can
choose any encoding method subject to finite computation).  
  
To be unbiased, the infinite sequence would have to contain, as a subsequence,
the choice to turn away from God (exit paradise). If the infinite sequence did
not contain the choice as a subsequence, the infinite sequence would not be an
unbiased random sequence and it would not be simple but would be complex.  
  
So the free choice to turn from God, given endless time, is inevitable.  
  
""I suppose that makes sense to someone who treats logic (and God) as

Logic can similarly be shown to have no necessary imposition on the will of

" _If a human on this Earth can choose a lesser good instead of a greater good,
that is a imperfection._  
  
A lamb which is killed by a lion for food is an imperfect lamb, also.  
  
As I already indicated, the state of a man on Earth able to sin _is indeed_
less complete and less perfect than his state in heaven, when he is no longer
able to sin, (though he has MORE, not less, freedom). This lesser sort of
perfection may be called ""imperfection"" in one sense, or it may be called a
""more limited"" condition that is _proper to one still in this life_ : Either
way, one must keep the _sense_ being used clear. Hence, one cannot employ the
position that our ""being able to sin"" represents an ""imperfection"" and
conclude that this contradicts Genesis saying that when God made the world, it
was ""good"" because man able to sin is ""not good"". That doesn't follow. A lamb
is able to die, and that's a lack of divine perfection (for God cannot die),
but it's a kind of ""im""perfection that is more properly understood as a
_lesser kind_ of perfection. And God intended a universe filled with beings
which are imperfect compared to Him, because it is impossible for Him to have
created beings that are uncreated perfection. He also intended a universe with
men who were capable of sin who then could achieve later the condition of the
Beatific Vision and no longer able to sin, by way of meritorious acts of love
of God made even IN the condition of able to sin.  
  
You just want to call a universe wherein even one being is capable of failing
to reach its end as ""good"". The Christian view of ""good"" is different.",1612

For under these tortures no one lost Christ by confessing Him... So that

has but also on a existential level on the christian life. The fact that he

"Of course Christian doctrine does not lead us to expect little or no
suffering, but that is a strong argument against Christian doctrine .  
The problem of evil (or suffering) does not say that there should not be so
much evil or suffering if _Christian doctrine_ is true, it says that the
existence of (so much) evil or suffering is incompatible with a tri-omni God
and _hence_ Christian doctrine, along with other doctrines about God, is
false. IOW Christian doctrine _cannot_ be true.  
It is hardly a secret that ""the Fall"" is one giant theodicy right from the
start. But it's a bad theodicy for several reasons, the most important one
being that a tri-omni God would not allow for any fall. Without the Fall human
beings would have experienced the beatific vision without the need of
suffering.  
  
Moreover, this article does not explain why the good are punished and neither
does Augustine, it actually comes down to ""nobody is good"" or ""the good are
not really punished."".  
People who ""shrink from doing their duty to condemn the wickedness that
surrounds them"" are not good, so they do not present a case af good people
being punished.  
  
And if ""the loss of worldly blessings – material goods, reputation,
friendships, health, livelihood, even life itself – is permitted by God so

good people suffer but it isn't a punishment.

""There is no way that you could argue that the actual existence of Satan is a

I would argue that the existence of Satan, qua *being* is a positive good,
because being is good -- this is Thomism 101. God did not create Satan as
Satan; Asking why permit or allow Satan qua Satan, is asking the wrong
question. Satan does not exist alone in a vacuum but as an element within the
created order. The created order is good (not even Satan wants to destroy it
to the point of non-existence which is what you are arguing entails, rather he
wants to pervert it to his *own* perverted ends); could there be some created
order that is better in some aspect or other, say, without Satan as Satan?
Maybe; and? At any rate, we have no way of ascertaining such things.

non-existence of man, I said non-existence of jmchugh -- I am explicitly

knowledge does not go well. If the fall had not happened, history would have
been different; we -- you and I -- would not be here, presumably different
people would be. But then there would have been no incarnation and no
resurrection, and no Most Blessed and Holy Virgin Mary. Some goods necessitate
some evils; as the Church and all the saints teach, God allows or permits some
evils, to bring about a bigger, better Good from them.  
  
""But there are more options than that. For we could accept for example
universal salvation, annihilationism, or reincarnation.""  
  
These are ""options"" to what? Certainly not to the fall. There is no need of
salvation if there is no fall. Both anihilationism and reincarnation have
fatal philosophical and theological (speaking as a Catholic) problems. Option
to hell? My guess is that you are thinking of Hell in the wrong way, but why

The point of the Fall is that man and not God is responsible for the Fall, but
nobody can be responsible for a necessary truth. that would be like saying you
are responsible for why 1 + 1 = 2.”  
  
Again, I think this is treating spiritual truth a bit like Newton’s laws of
motion. The fall is a spiritual fall, it’s when spiritual death first
appeared. Death can be seen as disintegration, but the modern, protestant,
literalist mind always assumes this to be physical. Do you really think no
creatures died before Adam and Eve ate the fruit?  
  
Remember also that Lucifer fell from heaven before Adams fall. There is a far
larger canvas here than just Adam and Eve eating something. Creating free,
rational beings seems to inevitably result in at least some of them failing in
terms if pride, and therefore obedience. If it’s not inevitable, it’s at least
the case in Gods perfect plan for creation.  
  
I do however also think that the fall was necessary at some point. We are each
created unique. Some of us are like the prodigal son, and some more like his
brother. There are lessons the Father wants both types to learn as part of the
process of our creation that is this life. Without the ‘fall’ of the prodigal
son, there is no opportunity for either brother to make the right choice to
align with the father. Just as the creation of our bodies was via a process of
ongoing refinement through suffering, our reconciliation with God is a
partaking in the redemptive suffering of God as son of man. It’s of course
true that man caused our fall. But God’s plan, from a perspective we can’t
even imagine yet, is perfect. Nothing has gone wrong. Bizarre as that may seem
to us at times in the middle of it, I believe this to be true.  
  ",1865
"""and neither are any of God's perfections and human perfections.""  
  
I disagree with that and you seem to be missing the point of analogy. Of
course God is not perfectED but he nevertheless is *literally* perfect in the
sense that he eminently possesses (eternally) all of the actualities that
creatures come to possess when they are perfected. As I said, it has long been
a standard thomistic view to say that God must *formally* possess all pure
perfections. This is related to what names we can literally predicate of God
with analogy. We don't say that God is wise just because God caused wisdom,
just like we don't say God is a cat (though he is the cause of cats and hence
has all of their actualities). Wisdom per se does not entail limitations, but
on the contrary, an increase in being.  
  
If you want to insist that this is no analogy of proper proportionality etc.
and discuss terminology, nevertheless the metaphysical point remains that God
must possess all of the actualities/perfections of its creatures (see ST I
question 4 for instance), and hence be relevantly like a moral agent unless
you think moral agency is intrinsically limiting.  
  
Again, would you say that God is not intelligent? That God is not wise? That
God is not free? Just because a perfection is found in a limited and
creaturely manner in us, that does not mean it is not a pure perfection per
se. The same goes for ""God is a moral agent"".  
  
""while the notion of moral is also rooted in the notion of custom (or more),
which in turn is intrinsically (both conceptually and existentially) dependent
upon a framework of human practices and institutions and corresponding ends
and modes of excellence""  
  
I completely disagree. To me, moral has to do with the necessary facts of
ethics. ""Moral agency"" simply refers to the capacity of beings possessed with
intellect and will (and hence freedom) to act in accordance with (or contrary
to) the necessary moral facts (such as ""torturing people is wrong/evil""). God
absolutely is a moral agent. Again, this has nothing to do with classical
theism but rather with whether ""moral agent"" is a pure perfection or not.  
  
And the point remains that when we attribute goodness, and moral goodness, to
God (and we do; and in particular, Christian believers must do that) there
must be some basic standards which God must fulfill, lest the attribution of
goodness becomes equivocal. It would not do to say ""God is most wise!!
Omniscient and perfectly knowing!"" and yet have God not actually knowing
whether we exist or not. But if God does not care about the suffering of
people (to the point where we could prima facie expect him to prevent or stop
it) then this God is not ""good"". He might be ""good"" the way a squirrel that
has all of its bodily parts is ""good"", but not good in the relevant sense that
believers profess him to be - and would, again, strike many of us as a
severely defective being (which should be impossible for the Purely Actual
source of all existence and perfection). This is all that is needed to get the
problem of evil going, however.  
  
It amazes me how some people don't realize that the ""God is not a moral agent""
line not only is metaphysically problematic for many (again, it has to do with
moral agency being a pure perfection or not, not with classical theism per se.
There are also classical theists that deny there is knowledge in God, after
all) but also only ""solves"" the problem of evil at the expense of making God
unworthy of love and worship to most believers, as well as a severely
defective and limited being to many metaphysicians.",3613
"Dr. Feser, thank you for a solid post on suffering.  
  
A few of the comments above have brought up the problem of ""animal pain.""
While I understand the standard response to that to be something along the
lines of ""necessity justified in view of the perfection of creation,"" I'm
wondering if there is not a richer answer hidden in the back of our tradition.
Specificly, I'm wondering about the role of angels in all this.  
  
Think of something like Tolkien's cosmology - physical evil and disorder
entered into creation when the principalities and powers of the world (The
Valar and Maiar) entered into conflict with each other, one desiring to
fullfill the creators plan to make a habitation for the ""children of
illuvitar"" (rational life), and others, out to make a dominion for themselves.
As proper ""sub-creators,"" God, in his secondary causality, had given spiritual
beings the duties of care and creation in the physical world, and the flaws,
imperfections, and downright violence of creation were due to the infidelity
of some of the powers intrusted to their care. If we hold the standard line
that fallen angels fell in the first instant of their creation, and, further,
that they had been, nevertheless, been given dominion over certain parts or
aspects of creation, then Johanine language about the ""lord of this world,""
and Pauline language about the ""princes of the powers of the air,"" makes a lot
more sense, and can even be joined to an evolutionary cosmology.  
  
The universe is an odd place, and the creation of the conditions for life, let
alone rational life, in an odd, (physically fallen?) cosmos could be seen as
the fruit of angelic conquest over malign forces. Furthermore, evolution
itself might be seen as being helped along or guided by forces trying to bring
about God's will in creation.

""If logic is contingent, so is God, because the proposition 'God exists' is,

Contingent logic and contingent truth are not the same thing. Logic is a
procedure that, properly used, takes us from one truth to another. Contingent
truth is not absolute truth. ""It takes an hour to swim across the lake"",
depends on the lake, the person swimming, and other contingent factors. God
knows all the contingencies. They are in the infinite sequence which is
contingent to us, but not to God, who is absolute truth. Furthermore, the
infinite sequence is an _image_ of God, a Divine Idea, meaning that God knows
it. But an image of God is not God any more than the pixels in your digital
photo of a tree are the tree. You cannot say that the tree does not have sap
because the photo does not have sap. Similarly, you cannot say that God is
contingent from the entertainment of an image of God. The image does not show
what God is, but it shows what you cannot say that God is not. Because people,
made in the image of God, can be stupid does not imply that God is stupid.  
  
God has no procedure of using logic. God knows the procedure of logic that you
use. He created it. That procedure, properly used, is whatever God wills it to
be. Whatever he wills it to be, it still allows humans to reason from one
contingent truth to another within the composite contingent truths that humans
understand.

"As I proposed in those earlier articles, bafflement at suffering is less the
_cause_ than the _consequence_ of the modern West’s apostasy from the Catholic
faith. It also reflects the softness and decadence of a dying civilization
that has become accustomed to affluence and cannot fathom a higher good beyond
ease and beyond this life, for the sake of which we might embrace suffering.
Nor is it apostates alone who exhibit this blindness. The spiritual rot has
eaten its way deep into the Church, afflicting even those who are otherwise
loyal to orthodoxy and Christian morality. And in our disinclination to accept
suffering, we are only ensuring ourselves more of it.",671

abortions. If there is no conception, God cannot abort ""unborn babies"" and

and miscarriages. But I suppose the fact that God performed them makes them

I do not necessarily reject the idea that being and goodness are the same, but
if that's so, being should be good and not be bad in any way. It doesn't
suffice that every being has ""some"" good, no, being ""is"" good.  
Hence, there cannot be anything bad. And that's the crux of the problem and
that's why the Classical Theism isn't consistent.  
To say that even bad things should exist is simply logically impossible ""if""
being is good. That's a straightforward contradiction.  
  
Sure, if an infinite multiverse exists, then somewhere, Quark the Ferengi
exists. That may not be an insane idea, but it is not the standard Christian
view, which is that God could have chosen not to create anything at all.  
Your claim about qualitative and quantitative maximization is interesting
here, because it contradicts what you claimed before, namely that ""being is
intrinsically good"". if being is intrinsically good, then not being is
intrinsically bad, so Quark the Ferengi not existing would be intrinsically
bad. Whether my ""type"" of goodness exists in someone else doesn't make my non-
existence a good thing.

Correct, i think that this is were the disagreement lies. Materials beings
like, say, cats, are by nature corruptive, they can be hurt, cease to be and
even suffer and die. Now, is these beings existence good enough that they are
desirable?  
  
You answer ""not necessarily"" for, from what i remember, you reject the ur-
platonist view that being and goodness are the same, so your criteria of what
a good thing is probably(i can only supose) tied to happiness in a way that
unhappiness in a large level is not the type of thing that should be desirable
at all.  
  
By contrast, someone like Aquinas would argue that even beings so fragile are
desirable for their existence allow for a major variety of good things and
even their decay and corruption is in a sense, and only in a sense, desirable
for the corruption of one material thing aways result in other things(even if
not usually living) and so ad variety.  
  
Remember that later pagans and ancient and medieval christians took effort to
argue against the gnostic view that the material world is bad because of the
inevitable corruption and decay its existence creates, which seems alive on
today antinatalists, so the view i'am defending does argue that even beings
that can and do suffer and die are good. The realism on universals, evil as
privation and ""being = goodness"" aspects are essencial to this to work, so

Catholic is evidence that I don’t think it’s a problem. It’s of course a very
difficult thing, and the argument is not in any way whatsoever that we should
just ignore suffering in others, to be indifferent to it. Quite the opposite,
doing the small bit we can to help those suffering in their different ways is
part of what we are asked to do. This is why I describe it as a necessary part
of our complete creation, and not as a good in itself. Of course us normal
Catholics don’t envy the suffering in others. However those who have the
deepest relationship with God do often become keen to suffer themselves, so
that they can ‘take up their cross’ and share in the sacrifice of God

you completely misunderstand, since almost all of what you say is tangential,

made from the standpoint of any such ""perfect(ed)"" agent, i.e., from the
standpoint of an agent who could conceivably have grounds for critiquing a
""fellow perfect-moral-agent,"" i.e., a fellow God. (FYI, the answer to the
classic question, ""What if God was one of us, just a slob like one of us?"" is

I know that in was in the books since the beginning, but that has been my
point all along. From the beginning, contrary to what Ed claims, suffering was
a problem and hence, from the beginning, there was a a need for theodicies.  
God may be good in only an analogous way, but an analogy has something in
common with what it is compared to, and your definition of goodness is
contrary to what is generally understood by goodness. What is more important
is that I think you are a good person and that in everyday life you use the
same definition of goodness that I do.  
And on that definition of goodness, every possibilty of evil would be ruled
out if that were possible. But yiurb definition of god's goodness is simply
circular ""Good is what God does and whatever god does is good"".  
  
It is indeed so that the Christian good is not all good in any meaningful
sense, not just not in the sense that we are but in no sense at all.  
Using people and their suffering as a means to get a more attractive creation
is not good in any meaningful sense. It is, in every meaingful sense,
appalling.  
  
The very fact that God also created saints that did not suffer is proof that,
contrary to what some of you claim, God could do it. It's just that he was
apparently more attracted to a world with suffering.

"It's not even obvious to me that we aren't making a category error by using
the term suffering univocally between humans and animals. Since we definitely
don't think (unless we're PETA weirdos) that we can apply concepts like
justice to animas in the same way that we apply it to humans, and that
suffering necessarily includes some component of injustice, I don't think
we've clearly defined what sorts of pain they animals experience ought to
properly qualify as suffering in a sense relevant to this discussion.",514
"I agree with Walter that the ""God is good only in an analogical sense, not a
univocal one!"" is a horrible and useless defense. As he said, when there is an
analogy there is something in common; in particular, in ""God is good"" there is
an analogy of proper proportionality. It is not a metaphor. For the classical
theist, God is the source of all actualities - and that includes virtues and
moral agency -, and as the source of all perfection and pure act God must
FORMALLY possess all pure perfections (that is, perfections that in themselves
include no limitation), but in an eminent way. The formal possession of pure
perfections by God is insisted upon by many thomists (e.g. Garrigou-Lagrange)
and is compatible with analogy (again, it's an analogy of proper
proportionality).  
  
Therefore, one can only say that ""God is not a moral agent"" or ""God is not
virtuous"" if one believes that moral agency and virtue are not pure
perfections. But I think it's obvious that they are pure perfections; the fact
that moral agency is found in us in a limited, creaturely manner doesn't make
it any less of a perfection just like the fact that wisdom is found in us in a
changing, limited, creaturely manner doesn't mean wisdom is not a perfection -
and the theist certainly says God is wise in a literal way. God is therefore
also properly said to be morally good - indeed, morally perfect - and this
goodness cannot contradict what seems basic to us with regard to evil, moral
value, etc. Just like we wouldn't say God is omniscient if he didn't literally
know (e.g.) that we exist. This is also why I think the ""Brian Davies"" line of
approaching the PoE is entirely useless. And it has nothing to do with
classical theism per se, but rather with moral virtue being or not being a
pure perfection. Needless to say, most people would agree that if God does not
at all care to stop a child from being tortured, then God is seriously
deficient (which should be impossible).  
  
Walter,  
  
That being said, I wonder how you can feel so confident about the presence of
suffering on this earth being totally pointless, and that it would be better
to have a world (e.g.) without any Fall at any point. Don't you think that
lies beyond your cognitive capacities? At the very least, doesn't it give you
pause? It is very clear to me that, for instance, a world consisting of
nothing but innocent people being tortured without end is a horrible world and
God could not make it. But while that is clear, it is not at all clear to me
that it would be immoral to have a world in which people suffered for some
finite time on earth, and then went on to enjoy a much longer happy afterlife.
And it is far from clear to me that the finite sufferings experienced in that
world could not end up contributing to making the good end-state better, or
just allowing for a good amount of soul-building, etc. I think you should give
more credit to skeptical theism.  
  
Don't get me wrong, I do see the strength in the problem of evil. But it seems
to me that you are a bit too confident in the idea that there could be no
morally sufficient reasons for God to create a world like ours; especially
given that we might only know such a small part of life and the world (it
could be like judging a whole novel on the basis of the first pages).",3317

rebelled, the fall happened. Did they had horrific consequences? Sure enough.

of the rebellion and the fall happened, good things that would not have
happened otherwise and (3) preferring an alternative world where I do not

know some necessary moral facts which allow me to say what God can or cannot
do (will or will not do). For instance, I am totally confident that it is
impossible for God to create a universe consisting of nothing but children
being burnt, tortured in horrible pain until they die and are annihilated -
they don't even go to heaven eventually, nothing. I am confident that God
cannot do that because it would be immoral.  
So I can use my knowledge of morality to know what God can or cannot do. Of
course, my knowledge will be limited and I could be mistaken about some
things, but that goes for anything and it doesn't mean I can't draw rational
conclusions here. And of some things I am very confident.  
  
""(what with ""ceteris paribus""* and all that -- wink wink) it's really not?""  
  
The ceteris paribus clause is there just because I am open to human suffering
possibly serving a greater good through e.g. soul-building theodicies,
""becoming stronger/virtuous through pain"", whatever. But the ceteris paribus
version of the proposition is still true, and so human suffering is something
that God should seek to alleviate/prevent, unless there is a stronger reason
why he can't/shouldn't (and that is when we are led to theodicy).  
  
""But in any case, so what? What are you alleging against the Almighty here?
That you're having trouble shaking the suspicion that you might have a better
grasp of Necessary Moral Truths than he does?""  
  
No? The point is that if God exists, he cannot fall short of the standards of
necessary moral truths as I was talking about. (Indeed, for me he would be the
Good itself, and the Good obviously cannot fall short of those moral facts;
rather they are supposed to be reflections of the Good, which is only more
reason to expect more of him than us, not less). And this sets up the problem
of evil, because clearly the world is prima facie a pretty crappy place.  
  
""It's not that hard, actually. If God is indifferent to (e.g.) a child being
tortured... (etc.)""  
  
""So again, back to the classic question: ""What if God was one of us,""  
  
What if God is truly and perfectly good and wise.  
  
""But as you yourself say: ""In which case he would not be God, as God is
supposed to be."" -- Right, but...""  
  
Yeah, but the point is that the problem of evil is a challenge to God's
existence. And it cannot be solved by holding that God, ""not a moral agent"",
could really just be indifferent to horrible evils and do nothing about them,
and so the existence of horrible evils ""could not possibly be incompatible
with him"". This solution doesn't work unless one is okay with (absurdly)
turning God into a seriously defective, irrational being, unworthy of worship
(because this is what it would be entailed by it for most people, myself
included). So the Davies line adds nothing to the problem; at the end of the
day, we need the standard responses (skeptical theism, theodicies, etc.).
Those responses come with an epistemic cost, but the theist must deal with
that.  ",3284

"@Simon  
  
Good point there, we do accept suffering a lot. I just suppose that Walter
would reply, that on these cases we would have the goods while not suffering
anything, which is a acceptable view to the non-christian.  
  
@Walter  
  
I see what you are saying. Just a correction: on the view i'am defending God
is beyond what we usually mean by good, for He has no essence separate from
His essence that He must be a great exemplar of, but is THE good that we all
recept a fraction, you could say. It is not a case of the voluntaristic view
were God chooses things to be good for no reason so i dont see much
circularity. The name ""good"" that we use to Him mean only that He has no lack,
but it has little to do with our virtues.  
  
Now, could this Being, beyond our good but also its cause, choose something
that we would not choose? I would say that we just cant know much of this
answer a priori. Since God has no nature that we can separate from Him and say
""His nature is to choose such and such"" them there is a sense were, while He
can by no means be evil*, He is sure hard to predict.  
  
Notice that the monotheistic-or-close pagans, that had no Bible, normally did
not really treat God as much similar to us. This because pure reason cant
really show much of how He thinks, only that He cant be bad(and what i
mentioned below). This world, revelation, the Incarnation, these are all
suprises that say a bit more of who He is but only say so much.  
  
  
*for being evil is to lack virtues, and God does not lack anything. One also could not expect Truth to lie or He to create us with our wills being draw to virtue(so commanding us to be good) and them command us to ignore virtue for no good reason, that would be contradictory and against Truth ",1769

"In chapter 8, Augustine notes that while there is in this life _some_
connection between evildoing and suffering on the one hand, and righteousness

good things, while the good suffer much misfortune. To be sure, this will be
redressed in the afterlife, when the good will be rewarded with eternal
happiness and the wicked with eternal torment. “But as for the good things of
this life, and its ills,” Augustine writes, “God has willed that these should
be common to both; that we might not too eagerly covet the things which wicked
men are seen equally to enjoy, nor shrink with an unseemly fear from the ills
which even good men often suffer.”",721

Of course, you can argue that the Christian God is evil either according to
Christianity own view of goodness or a diferent view of goodness that is taken
to be objective.  
  
I'am taking care of arguing against the view that God can be seen as evil on
the christian own standards but i admit that this is not much because you
clearly take a diferent view on goodness, seeing your argumentation and being
a vegetarian, so you could aways reply ""yea, this god is not evil if we accept
a wrong definition of good"". I suppose that this is why you say that
apologists are changing the definition if goodness.  
  
On the christian view, God can be said to do good to us not only in giving us
the chance of Heaven but even in creating we as imperfect as we are. Even
existing badly is better that not existing for being is intrinsically good.
Now, the zoo example and your vegetarianism* show that you disagree with this,
i suppose that being is not good to you on every situation or case and, living
on a world were suffering is so prevalescent, i can see were this come from,
it is a judgment impossible to never make at least for a moment while living
under the sun.  
  
So i think that i see the source of the disagreement here: you and the
christian tradition have diferent views on goodness that change the perception
of this world and the judgment of Goodness Itself making it. To agree with the
christian message you would need a radical change on value that the christian
tradition(at least on your view) need way more evidence to justify.  
  
Anyway, i hope that at least i could make the christian response i'am
defending appear less ad hoc, for i do see it as being internally coherent.
The discussion helped see the disagreement more clearly, thanks! Dont know if
we should go to discussing the accounts of good directly today.

conclusion is false – again, he was no atheist – but rather that, given his

notion of causality, he argues, applies only _within_ the phenomenal world,

its realization _cannot_ be guaranteed in this life, since there is, he

Well, Kant starts with the humean thesis that sense data can only generate
contigent knowledge. He quickly realized that empiricism is dumb, for we do
have necessary knowledge, so he was a sort of rationalist early. Necessary
knowledge comes from reason.  
  
But them Kant understood that sense data is pretty much how we have
information about reality, so if our necessary knowledge does not come from
the senses them it either:  
  
1\. Has no basis on reality and is mere play with definitions(which smart
empiricists do defend).  
  
2\. Come from something else.  
  
The prussian argued that at least mathematics is a sort of necessary knowledge
that is not created by language, so 2 won. His answer was that we can know
some truths about how we happen to organize sense data by analysing the
necessary conditions to our experience to it to be how it is. For instance,
every experience we have is in time, it has a sucession and all that, so we
can derive several truths about that(inded, mathematics would have his origin
on the forms of time and space).  
  
And so, by knowing this structure we could show that every possible experience
we could have need to obey a certain structure and so gather several truths
about how things appear to us. This method is worthless to know things we cant
empirically know, though.",1531

in the _Critique of Practical Reason_ , it seeks the highest good. And the
highest good, he argues, would be the conjunction of moral virtue, which makes
us worthy of happiness, with happiness itself.",505

too simple to read Hume as a mere skeptic, full stop. True, he does try to
undermine traditional metaphysical views about substance, causation, the self,
moral value, etc. But he also emphasizes that the hold such notions have over
common sense cannot be shaken by philosophical skepticism, since they are too
deeply rooted in human psychology. And for purposes of “common life,” they are
indispensable. Hume’s aim is merely to clip the wings of highfalutin

that you keep harping on about), is a philosophical demonstration that the
existence of evil is inconsistent with God’s attributes of goodness,
omnipotence, etc. If Plato’s good work an argument provides a potential “out”
then the argument in the problem of evil fails because the conclusion does not
follow from the premises.  
  
Notice how in the thousands of words that Dr. Feser has devoted to the topic
of existential inertia, he has never once asked “where is the hard evidence
for existential inertia?” Because it doesn’t matter if you have independent
reasons to think such a thing exists. If the mere possibility of it’s
existence is consistent with the metaphysical premises of the classical
theists, then (most) cosmological arguments fail.

explanations, but stop pretending that “theists btfo with FACTS and LOGIC!!”

What do ""stripped of all its properties"" means? Even if you take away all of a
being visible characteristics there would still be the potentials, the thing
being a composite of essence and existence, the thing having started to be
etc, so perhaps 2 is false.  
  
Besides, I'am against conceivability arguments in general. Aunt May sure can
conceive of a Spiderman that is not Peter Parker, this is what she does, but
he is still the Spider. But this is the less important point, for the argument
is not the normal conceivability argument.  
  
On top of that, our cognition starts by a thing characteristics, we only know
the substance latter, and we classify things according to the characteristics
it has, so it is should not suprise us that we cant conceive of it with no
characteristics.  
  
I mean, a human is a rational animal, the essence is separated by its
characteristics. The diference between one essence and another is the
essencial characteristics any has, so it is no wonder that we cant
diferentiate one from another once we take the essencial characteristics away.  
  
So perhaps 1 is false, for it is probably the case that even on a substance
view of the self we should expect 2 to be true. Maybe only on Scotus-like view
were every thing has a natural ""haecceitas""(had to google) 2 would be false.

confidence_ in the power of reason. In particular, it reflects the conviction
that ultimate explanation is possible, that the world can be made intelligible

universals."" Oberst agrees with some nuance (trying to situate Kant in some

Without getting into exegesis of Kant on this point, do you think nominalism

justify induction, and in part because the deliverances of modern physics are
hardly less abstruse and remote from common life than the rationalist
speculations he was so keen to shoot down. A Humean must also give up a
rationalistic ethics, given that, as he famously holds, there is nothing
contrary to _reason_ (but only to the sentiments of the average person) to
prefer that the entire world be destroyed than that one should suffer a

"Splendid! Finally an actual argument.  
  
Let’s recap: your initial claim is that the logical problem of evil provides
good philosophical reasons not to believe in the God of classical theism
because it shows there is no way to reconcile the bad things that happen to
people with “Omni” attributes we want to affirm about God.  
  
A response to this claim was then given that one possible “out” that can
preserve these divine attributes by hypothesizing that God could make
restitution to the wronged parties in the next life.  
  
You then made a bunch of irrelevant remarks about how everyone who disagrees
with you on this topic is stupid, and most people probably gave up on the
conversation. But now we actually have a non-trivial and non-circular
response! An immortal soul cannot exist that survives after death because we
don’t know how a soul interacts with the brain, so it is therefore impossible
for God to offer restitution to a person after death.  
  
Now that we have that all our of the way, ready for the philosophy? You sure?
Ok here it is:  
  
I reject your premise. An unsolved question is not a demonstration that two
concepts are incompatible.  
  
This is further justified by the arguments that Dr. Feser has made here (and
others have made elsewhere) that the mind cannot be wholly materially
determinate, and that there must be an immaterial component to our thoughts
(which is positive evidence for the soul).  
  
I conclude that the above theodicy has not been rebutted, and therefore the
problem of evil fails to demonstrate what you want to claim.",1582

of natural science and ethics to tell us anything about objective reality. And
if you accept a Kantian critique of natural theology, then while you can
consistently take natural science and ethics to have a rational basis, you
cannot consistently treat theology with the contempt that Dawkins and Co.
typically do. Hence the lessons so many have drawn from Hume’s and Kant’s

conclusion is false – again, he was no atheist – but rather that, given his

notion of causality, he argues, applies only within the phenomenal world, the
world of things as they appear to us, whereas reasoning to a necessary being
would require applying it beyond that world, to the noumenal world or things

"Kant took the emergent sense of self of his era, and made it the seat of all
knowledge. He first promulgated the belief that it is the subject (the viewer)
that is central to knowledge, and not the object viewed. Socratics believed
that truth was a quality that existed outside of human perception. It was a
philosopher’s job to search it out. Plato, unwittingly, gave a demonstration
of this in his famous parable about shadows in a cave that we have touched on.
People are chained to a cave wall and can see only shadows thrown from objects
passing before a fire behind them. Since this is all they ever see, they will
mistake the shadows for reality. In this example, perception is not the seat
of knowledge at all, but instead a false prophet. Truth does not exist in the
perception of the person in the cave, but is an independent quality that is
outside not only the viewer’s perception, but also outside the cave itself.
Jesus took this a step further in describing truth not as a quality, but as a
god, as independent from a man’s perception as it is possible to be. Truth was
God, and came from God, and it was our job to accept God and His will for us.
Saint Paul, foremost architect of the Christian church, anticipates Kant’s
description of spiritual truth as something outside of sensory perception in I
Corinthians Chapter 2: “We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the
hidden wisdom, ... Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into
the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared”. In Paul’s view, we
don’t get knowledge of God through our senses, but “God hath revealed them
unto us by his Spirit.” Truth is truly outside of ourselves, and absolutely
outside of our perception. It must be revealed by God. “Now we have received …
the spirit which is of God; that we might know … not in the words which man’s
wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth”. In this case, a viewer’s
perception is useless, for truth can be known only through revelation to the
spirit. Kant turned this around to teach that we cannot truly know any object
outside of ourselves. All we can know is our view of that object. Thus, all
knowledge is contingent on the subject, or subjective. There is no truth that
we can find in an object, because we see that object only through our view. We
see only our piece of it. From this point, he built a philosophical system
which used scientific observation as a lens to determine what we can know, how
we can know it, and how we learn it and describe it. At the same time, Kant
held on to the notion that there may be truth that is outside of our ability
to observe its phenomena, and so prove it. In fact, Kant felt he had proved
that there were phenomena that did not have any observable traces, and so
could not be known. He used the origin of matter in the universe as an
example. It is here. It had to get here from somewhere, but where did it come
from? Everything we can sense has an action and reaction. Everything has a
start. So, what about matter? In short, Kant proved that we see things
subjectively, but went on to show that this does not mean that objective truth
does not exist, but only that we cannot observe objective truth, since we
cannot observe the object itself. I will give you a CliffsNotes version to say
that Kant built a science-based philosophy that still left room for Saint
Paul’s belief that God’s truth could not come to us through our senses, but
only through revelation.",3476

True, he did not think reason could penetrate into the natures of things as

a critique of traditional metaphysics and natural theology. However, in Kant’s
view this entailed no doubts about the rational foundations of morality or of

itself). A consistent Humean has to put natural theology, natural science, and

experience _for us_. But this suggests the need to distinguish between two

It will depend on the school, but most dualists i can think of can account for
this.  
  
Take for instance the more platonic/dharmic/spiritist view that the soul is a
substance whose nature is other than the body and that not only has no
necessary conection with it but is actually weakened by being stuck with it.
This is pretty straightfoward here: the soul is stuck with the body
limitations and so its natural capacities will be worser on a crappier body.  
  
Take now the cartesian view were the soul is a substance whose nature is other
than the body but is made to function with the body. Here the sould and the
body must function together to it to work well, so a bad body will make the
soul less capable of functioning.  
  
Now take the thomistic view were the soul is the form of the body. Here things
also work well, for the body is responsable for sense data, memory and
imagination and the intellect(that the soul is responsable for) needs sense
data everytime it needs to function*, so if the body do not work well, them
the sould is screwed.  
  
So it seems that the forms of dualism defended by philosophers, at least with
a religious mindset, can work well on this case. The only type of dualism i
can't see explaining it is the one you see on most fiction with superhumans or
magic were someone can turn into a fly or a bird, say, and still think. If the
soul can work well on these situations, brain damage should be easy.

moral argument, hard to dismiss if you agree with the initial premises, it is
just that atheists do not.  
  
About the problem of evil, i dont remember Plato adressing it at all*, but he
believed that:  
  
\- the soul is living in a innatural condition when stuck in the body  
  
\- that the soul is only happy when it goes to the intellectual goods, which
every soul has the potential to do.  
  
\- that after death the soul just goes eventually to another body  
  
It seems that these premises do help developing a response to the problem of
evil. Proclus,probably the best neoplatonist, did make a interesting little
book on it, worth a reading.  
  
*makes sense that the hebrews would know it(see the Torah and Job) before him, the gods that the atheists/agnostics of his time were discussing were the greek ones, so it would not come from they, and Plato was not only a elitist but also probably a ascetic, hardly the guy to care about lower people not having material goods",1528

The moral nature of man argument. If God decides to create man. Including
mankind's moral nature.  
  
God has three choices  
1\. Create mankind with a bad moral nature.  
2\. Create mankind with an indifferent moral nature.  
3\. Create mankind with a good moral nature.  
  
Our God given moral nature constrains our free will the free will argument for
existence of moral evil fails. Creating mankind with an indifferent moral
nature does not confer free will on mankind, just gurantees moral evil will be
committed in this world.  
  
If God is good, just, merciful, compassionate, and wise and cares about us,
God must choose to create all mankind with the best moral nature possible.  
  
The Problem Of Evil is not really A Problem, but is many such little problems
that have no answers. Theology should be about logic if Theologians give us
claims without hard evidence. The hard evidence in this world is moral evil
exists. Logic such as above demonstrates theological opinions seem to be very
wrong. How many logical dead ends like this does an Atheist need to

"Kant was one of the world's greatest thinkers. He phillosophy foresaw quantum
mechanics.  
  
Kant did not view things-in-themselves as containing the sum of all
possibilities, and phenomena all actualities; but this duality is conformable
to Kant's metaphysics as to none other. As a contribution to the metaphysics
of possibility, the quantum mechanical wave function can easily be seen as
complementary to Kant's idea of things-in-themselves, where various kinds of
things can happen (like free will) that are not comprehensible in terms of
phenomenal reality. Kant would just have to allow that characteristics of
physical reality can intrude some depth into things-in-themselves, which he
would not have considered -- though we can also handle this by positing an
intermediate level of reality, between true unconditioned things-in-themselves
and true discrete phenomenal objects -- as Kant otherwise actually does
himself for space and time as ""pure intuitions."" The wave function straddles
the classic Kantian boundary, sharing some properties with phenomena, others,
as underlying phenomena, with things-in-themselves.  
  
Thus, where Kant would have considered all of phenomena governed by
determinism, we now see the wave function as deterministic, while the collapse
of waves into particles is random. Although chance in quantum mechanics has
often been argued as allowing for free will, a free cause is still a very
different thing from a random cause, which doesn't need mind or self or
intention. Moral freedom is thus still left among things-in-themselves. Kant
himself would have had difficulty placing randomness in his ontology, if he,
like Hume, believed that chance violates determinism. Since chance is now part
of the physics, it cannot be denied; but it also still remains a different
matter from purposive freedom.  
  
Kant's idea that space and time do not exist among things-in-themselves has
been curiously affirmed by Relativity and quantum mechanics. In Relativity,
time simply ceases to pass at the velocity of light: for photons that have
travelled to us as part of the Cosmic Background Radiation, time has stood
still for most of the history of the universe. On the other hand, quantum
mechanics now posits ""non-locality,"" i.e. physical distances, and so the
limitation of the velocity of light in Relativity, don't seem to exist. This
means that although time may apply to the wave function, space may not. The
full empirical reality of space is only found among discrete particles and
objects.  
  
This curious result is the consequence of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
Paradox, which was intended by Einstein as a reductio ad absurdum of quantum
mechanics. If, for instance, a positron and an election are both created from
an energetic photon, the conservation of angular momentum requires that one be
spinning one way, and the other the other. But the complementary spins are
equally probable for each particle. Thus, in quantum mechanical terms, the
wave functions of each particle divide without a discrete state being
determined. The particles might then separate to even cosmological distances,
but as soon as the spin of one particle is observed, the other particle must
have the opposite spin, which means that the wave function has collapsed
across those cosmological distances and caused the other particle to assume a
predictable spin. If this occurs instantaneously, it would violate the
limitation of the velocity of light in Special Relativity.  
  
This has now been shown to actually occur on the basis of Bell's Theorem (from
John Bell, 1928-1990), meaning that Quantum Mechanics does violate Special
Relativity by allowing instantaneous interactions across even cosmological
distances. However, once observed, processes must still obey Special
Relativity and the limitations of spatial distance, creating the kind of
duality described by Kant.

Fragment"". It's on pages 108-109 on this online version.
https://archive.org/details/religionandphilo00heinuoft/page/108/mode/2up  
  
“The history of Immanuel Kant's life is difficult to portray, for he had
neither life nor history. He led a mechanical, regular, almost abstract
bachelor existence in a little retired street of Königsberg, an old town on
the north-eastern frontier of Germany. I do not believe that the great clock
of the cathedral performed in a more passionless and methodical manner its
daily routine than did its townsman, Immanuel Kant. Rising in the morning,
coffee-drinking, writing, reading lectures, dining, walking, everything had
its appointed time, and the neighbors knew that it was exactly half-past three
o'clock when Kant stepped forth from his house in his grey, tight-fitting
coat, with his Spanish cane in his hand, and betook himself to the little
linden avenue called after him to this day the ""Philosopher's Walk."" Summer
and winter he walked up and down it eight times, and when the weather was dull
or heavy clouds prognosticated rain, the townspeople beheld his servant, the
old Lampe, trudging anxiously behind Kant with a big umbrella under his arm,
like an image of Providence.  
  
What a strange contrast did this man's outward life present to his
destructive, world-annihilating thoughts! In sooth, had the citizens of
Königsberg had the least presentiment of the full significance of his ideas,
they would have felt far more awful dread at the presence of this man than at
the sight of an executioner, who can but kill the body. But the worthy folk
saw in him nothing more than a Professor of Philosophy, and as he passed at
his customary hour, they greeted him in a friendly manner and set their
watches by him.”

What defines ""race"". It has had different meanings at different times, and in
different contexts.  
  
_of racial issues_  
  
Which issues? No, **specifically** which issues? Those of injustice? What
about injustices commited by blacks at blacks? Oh, do you mean injusticed
committed by blacks on whites? Shoot, reverse that, I mean by whites on
blacks? What about all the other kinds of racial injustices?

black man marries a white woman. In 2 generations, there will be no racial
divide at all.  
  
_how about totally free education_  
  
Mere ""education"" doesn't do it, if (a) the recipient isn't willing or able to
**receive** it. (Free) public high schools have enormous drop-out rates in
some areas, (mostly by minorities but not solely) - they theoretically have a
free education in front of them, but they decline it. If you re-make _college_
education to meet the standards of public schools, you'll get the same result.  
  
_Specific, bold, measurable plan of action with a defined vision of success._  
  
If you want to define success in such a narrow way, you guarantee failure in
respect of _other kinds_ of success. But aside from that: if your attempt were
to meet with ANTI-success (say, increased income gap), would you then **re-
pay** the people you took the money from to pay for that effort? (Because,
after all, it would have been demonstrated to be unjust.) And...whose money
would you use to do that?  
  
If you want to state a measurable outcome as ""success"", then you have to
equally identify what constitutes a ""failure"" of the attempt. And you have to
account for the _implications_ of failure, social and otherwise. Which means:
""free"" might not, actually, be free.",2099
"Isn't that what affirmative action effectively already does to some extent,
which, incidentally, is on the chopping block? Except here, no rich people
need to shave any money off their bank accounts. And hasn't it failed? And
wasn't it just a lazy way of pretending to solve what is essentially a
cultural problem? (Recent African immigrants, by contrast, do very well,
academically and professionally, even after our previous American schools
teach them that, despite what their lying eyes tell them, they are, in fact,
oppressed, that there's no sense in denying it, and the only way out of the
invisible cage is through rage and self-pity.)  
  
But more to the point... By making things concrete, you make them tractable,
and when you make them tractable, you make it possible to arrive at a
goalpost. But who wants that? Once a problem is resolved, careers and
institutions built around the problem are threatened because you've taken away
their very raison d'etre. They no longer have the cudgel or leverage they once
had.  
  
The same is true of feminism. Many feminist demands have been met. But has
feminism gone away? If anything, it's become even more radicalized. People
often project their personal dissatisfactions and discomforts onto some
external, broad ""common cause"". Doing so allows them to feel in control, like
they've named the beast. Living a boring life? Must be because of racism. Not
getting what you want? Must be because of sexism or misogyny. And once the
demands of such people are met, they discover they're still where they were

kvetching, but it is untrue that unless I can provide an alternative solution,
I have no right to dismiss or reject an idea.  
  
I also disagree with the problem statement and the premise that the solution
involves some kind of massive payout by the so-called 1%. First, a wealth
disparity between racial groups is not per se a problem to be solved. Second,
if it is a problem, it isn't necessarily the result of any kind of racism in
any tangible sense. It could be cultural, and I claim that the problem is
largely cultural (for example, Thomas Sowell, for example, opines that the
disintegration of the black family beginning in the 1960s, often assisted by
well-meaning social programs, has had a devastating effect on black Americans;
I would also mention ideologies of perpetual powerlessness and victimhood that
both demoralize and divert energy away from constructive activity toward
ineffectual grievance and blame). Third, even if it were racist, I don't see
what the rich have to do with it unless you can show that they employ racist
policies specifically to impoverish certain racial groups (the targeting of
the rich under the pretext that they benefit from a rigged system is the kind
of sloppy and unjust rationalization I would expect from a Marxist who foments
class conflict). Fourth, throwing money at problems is precisely what (per
Sowell) created much of the problems we're seeing today. NGOs, often run by
wealthy philanthropists, offer a relevant example of how funneling money and
free goods into causes can cause more damage than it solves (the destruction
of the Nigerian cotton and textile industry through mitumba, the destruction
of Haitian farming through free rice given long after a crisis has passed,
even something like the effect of TOMS on African shoe manufacturing and
repair). I'm not saying *charitable* work cannot help, but I would be very
suspicious of any ""philanthropic"" or even government-mandated solution given
their track record. More importantly, no amount of money can solve the basic
problem which, again, is cultural. Maybe Catholic missionaries could play a
role here. The Catholic Church is, after all, what turned even the pig-chasing
savages of Europe into something resembling a civilization. Only after the
Church has given structure to the mission to lift black America out of
spiritual and moral decay and, secondarily, poverty, does talk of money make
sense because only then can it be used and allocated prudently and with care.
But expect also a good deal of opposition from those who pretend to be
concerned for such minorities, especially when the Catholic Church is involved

Yes, it does remain true. The statement 1 = 2 is a statement about the nature

room and board, everything) at every level for historically oppressed
minorities, paid for by the super-rich, and continued until such time as the
wealth gap between whites and minorities was erased._  
  
Amazing how so many plans to erase a racial divide (which must always be
illicit and evil, not at all natural) inevitably turns into a not-so-subtle
payday for people. There's a reason why ""free"" room and board, tuition, and
education is paired with the requirement that it be ""paid for"" by someone
else: because it's not free. And it's not going to be the super-rich paying
either.  
  
If the concern is to provide education as cheaply and freely as possible,
maybe we should consider price caps on tuition. The fact is, with the modern
internet, we are capable of providing a massive amount of education for dirt
cheap compared to what traditional, outdated institutions currently offer. In
fact, we already do so: see Coursera, or all kinds of other online options.  
  
But this solution, while clearly viable and even superior to the traditional
alternative, would not enrich the bloated, inefficient education system. And,
for all the cries of racism and inequality, circumventing that kind of payout
is not a price the loudest antiracists are willing to pay.

It's entirely reasonable to challenge, and perhaps dismiss, any particular
plan of action. But the way to do that is to replace one plan with another,
not to merely content ourselves with rejectionism.  
  
What typically happens is that somebody will suggest some plan, everyone else
will immediately starting proclaiming it wrong, while offering no plan of
their own, and so nothing happens, and centuries of racial divide continues.  
  
For myself, I see no good reason why the top 1% of our society, who control at
least a third of the nation's wealth, and are those who have most benefited
from America's rigged system, should not lift up those who have been most
oppressed by it. Such an effort need not cost the average person a nickel, so

Personally, I reject the conviction that commonly understood racism is some

as established beyond reasonable doubt, I grant. I'm willing to go against the
grain there.  
  
But what's interesting here is that, in spite of my view, I nevertheless *did*
offer an alternative -- after all, increased access to education is a worthy
goal itself. But you seem to have overlooked my suggestions. Perhaps it was
invisible precisely because it involved no massive wealth transfer to teachers
and activists. And if that's the reason it didn't even register, well. Doesn't
that say a lot?

Were there Poles who committed crimes during WWII, who went along with Nazi,
or Soviet, crimes? Obviously. I feel silly even having to state the obvious
because this is something that follows not from empirical fact, but from the
general proposition that the moral status of the actions of individuals during
wartime does not conform strictly to the divide of the front line. There were
righteous Germans and righteous Russians and wicked Poles. So what? Judas
betrayed Christ, but the Apostles on the whole or as a corporate body were not
agents of the Sanhedrin. We can say the same about Jews who betrayed both
their fellow Jews and committed crimes against gentile Poles, but we rarely
talk about those, so why the special pleading here?  
  
As a matter of empirical fact, we must remember things like:  
  
1\. The Polish state never collaborated with the Nazis. Compare that with
other European governments. This refusal to collaborate, and the formation of
Europe's largest resistance, happened at enormous cost. This, in addition to
Nazi crimes against the populace.  
2\. Even the number of only those Poles recognized by Yad Vashem outstrips the
combined number of people recognized from all other nations combined.
Proportion and scale matter.  
3\. The penalties for aiding Jews were uniquely and incomparably severe in
Poland (involving the execution of the person aiding, his family, maybe
neighbors, etc). And yet, point (2).  
4\. Poland was home to something like 80% of world Jewry at the time of the
war and the majority of the world's Jews for centuries. Any occurrence of
antipathy (and don't forget Jewish bigotry, which did exist) at the time of
the war was driven by economic, but also cultural, political, social, and
historical factors, not racial hatred. That is, there was no impulse to
exterminate any group and any crimes committed were isolated incidents of
criminal opportunism taken during the chaos of wartime, not systematic
programs of liquidation or some broad expression of national hatred. There
were also incidents where Poles were forced under threat of death to
participate in Nazi operations, incidents that some Jewish authors have

""I would suggest that the principle only holds within a constrained , limited
context, and not absolutely - for the reason that ""equals"" does not inherently
mean ""the same in every possible respect"". In the realm of quantity, if you
are speaking of one aspect of the two referents x and y, x=y may well imply
f(x) = f(y) because you have limited the context of the ""is equal"" itself. But
it doesn't hold in every respect if x is not the same as y in every respect.
If x is ""8"" and y is ""4 + 4"" and z is ""3 + 5"", then they are not the same in
respect of ""expressed as a whole singular"" versus ""expressed as a sum of equal
parts"" or ""expressed as a sum of primes""""  
  
The = sign *does* stand for identical; the names in both sides of the sign
name the same, identical thing. As far as your putative counter-examples, I
would say in response you are no longer talking about ""8"" or even ""8"" under
some aspect, but of some other thing altogether that is somehow related to ""8""
-- expression trees, additive or prime decompositions, partitions, or whatever
else you have in mind.  
  
I should clarify that I am *not* dismissing any criticisms of first order
logic, or even saying that this way of talking is the best way of talking in
every possible practical and theoretical subject. To give a simple, obvious
example, as far as I know there is no good satisfactory account of intensional
contexts. This way of talking entails no contradictions (or at least any
obvious ones) and is especially useful in mathematics though; part of the
reasons are certainly contingent and reflect the way how mathematicians are
trained, but I would contend that they also reflect a deep intuition.
Mathematical objects are simple in the sense that their identity conditions
are sharp and clearly delineated -- they are the furthest removed from the
material. Virtually all of mathematics can be formalized in ZFC, possibly with
some extra large cardinal axioms; *equality* itself can be defined in terms of
the other primitives (in symbols: x = y iff forall z, z e x <=> z e y). In
this setting, we have: (1) *everything* is a set and (2) *everything* can be
constructed bottom up from the empty set via (possibly transfinite) iteration.
This is a large amount of reduction and simplification, yielding a powerful
framework. But to circle back to the criticisms, it also has its downsides.
Now suddenly, it make senses to ask the non-sensical question if the number 5
is an element of the number 1023. This question has a definite truth value but
its value depends on the specific, non-essential details of the construction
of the natural numbers in ZFC.",2648

To make clear what I meant by recent politics, take, for example, Act H.R.1226
and Senate Act S.447 through which certain organizations, with the aid of the
US government, are trying to extract massive sums of money from the Polish
state for so-called heirless property that once belonged to Jews. According to
both Polish law and the general legal principle followed virtually everywhere,
property without a legal heir reverts to the state after the death of its
owner. If a legal heir exists, he is free to pursue restitution like everyone
else through the Polish courts. The absurd position of certain groups is that
the Polish government should treat these cases in a extraordinary way and
offer broad restitution anyway, not to any heirs, because of course they don't
exist, but to organizations and people who are not legal heirs. And recall
that this was property held by Polish citizens as Polish Jews were Polish
citizens. By reinforcing the notion that Poles, as a corporate body, are
guilty of collaborating in the criminal program of the Nazis, it becomes
easier to make claims on the Polish state. Heirless property, combined with a
sprinkle of customary special pleading, misrepresentation, and the thought-
diffusing VIP pass that is the word ""Holocaust"", provides a convenient
opportunity for unscrupulous organizations to illegitimately extract billions
of dollars from the Polish state by exploiting the emotional force of a
historical tragedy. Perhaps such organizations should instead direct their
claims to Berlin as the German state is responsible for handling the
restitution of Jewish property lost through actions of the Nazi regime. As I
mentioned already, the Poles have not received a dime of restitution for the
absolute obliteration of their country, its cities, its cultural heritage, not
to mention the torture, exploitation, and deaths of millions of its citizens,

Well, here's what Adiele's book, which I quoted from has to say on the subject
(see p. 469):  
  
""In the course of making this investigation, the basic question that guided
this work is: Did the popes of the Church actively involve themselves in the
enslavement of Black Africans during the Transatlantic slave trade? At the end
of this investigation, the findings from the historical sources available to
this study unfortunately tended to answer this basic question in the positive.
This slave trade was not only supported and approved by the Catholic  
Church but also received the blessings of the popes for a good number of
reasons.""

Black African enslavement.""

hours looking through his book online last night, before commenting on it. And
yes, I'm pretty confident of my interpretation of the author's views, as I

You might also want to read what the author says about the curse of Ham on pp.

Re chattel slavery: Aizen, if your only quarrel is with the kind of slavery
that claims to own a man's soul as well as his body, then I respectfully
submit that your claim is untenable in practice. The soul cannot be free
unless the body is. You cannot coherently claim to own a man's labor without
claiming to own the man himself. As Elizabeth Anscombe famously put it in her
inaugural lecture as Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge University in 1971,
titled, ""Causality and Determination"": ""My actions are mostly physical
movements; if these physical movements are physically predetermined by
processes which I do not control, then my freedom is perfectly illusory."" And
I might add: ""if my physical movements are determined by the whims of a slave-
master whom I cannot control, then my freedom is perfectly illusory.""",2548

"Hi Mister Geocon and Oktavian,  
  
Belief in the Curse of Ham has a long Catholic pedigree. Most of the following
quotations are taken from Adiele's book.  
  
Several Church Fathers (e.g. St. Basil of Caesarea, St. John Chrysostom, St.
Ambrose, St. Augustine of Hippo) all taught that the human institution of
slavery had its origin in Ham's sinfulness. They did not link this to Africa.
However, St. Jerome disturbingly refers to ""Ethiopians"" (Kushites) as ""black
and cloaked in the filth of sin,"" adding: ""At one time we were Ethiopians in
our vices and sins. How so? Because our sins had blackened us.""  
  
Surprisingly, the first text to explicitly link the curse of Ham to Black
Africans was the Babylonian Talmud, completed around 600 AD.  
  
In the tenth century, Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria (877-940) was the
first Christian Church leader to identify Black Africans as being among those
afflicted by the Curse of Ham:  
  
“Cursed be Ham, and may he be servant of his brothers...He himself and his
descendants, who are the Egyptians, the Negroes, the Ethiopians, and it is
said the  
Barbari.”  
  
According to the famous Christian geographical work ""Cursor Mundi"" (1300
A.D.), Noah's son Shem and his descendants were freemen who dwelt in Asia.
Japhet and his descendants were nobles and knights who came to live in Europe,
while ""Ham, the accursed"" and his descendants were slaves who were sent to
Africa.  
  
In the 15th century, the famous Portuguese chronicler Gomes Eannes de Azurara
(1410-1474) appealed to the writings of a 12th century archbishop of Toledo,
Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada (1170-1247) to support his contention that Black
Africans were doomed to servitude because they were the accursed descendants
of Ham:  
  
""The servitude of non-Muslim Moors (West Africans) resulted from the curse,
which,  
after the Deluge, Noah laid upon his son Ham, cursing him in this way: 'that
his race  
should be subject to all the other races of the world. And from his race these
Blacks are descended,' as wrote the Archbishop Don Roderick of Toledo and
Josephus in his Book on the Antiquities of the Jews, and Walter, with other
authors who have spoken of the generations of Noah from the time of his going
out of the Ark.""  
  
In the 15th century, Dominican Friar Johannes Annius of Viterbo (1432-1502)
wrote that the curse of Ham forced him into exile in Africa: “As a result of
his sin, Ham is exiled to Africa.”  
  
In the 18th century, French biblical scholar and Benedictine abbot Augustine
Calmet (1672-1757) wrote in a work titled “Dictionary of the Holy Bible”
(1722): “Noah assigned to Ham the nations of Africa. The occasion of the color
of his sons was that Noah being one day asleep discovered his nakedness, and
Ham passed that way without covering him; on which accounts his descendants
are born with black complexion, and the gift of the prophecy was taken from
them.”  
  
In the 19th century, John England, the first Catholic bishop of Charleston,
USA, wrote in a letter to US Secretary of State John Forsyth (1780-1841) that
the enslavement of Black Africans was entirely lawful, because of the sin
committed by their ancestor, Ham:  
  
“Since every Catholic must accept Adam's fall as an essential ingredient in
the human condition, he should likewise believe that it certainly was not then
against the divine law for Shem and Japheth to use the services of the Black
race, since their progenitor had been cursed by God for his sinful conduct.”  
  
Finally, Pope Pius IX issued a Prayer for the Conversion of Africa through the
Office of the Sacred Congregation of Rites on October 2, 1873, in which he
declared: ""“Let us pray for the most wretched Ethiopians in Central Africa,
that Almighty God may at length remove the curse of Cham from their hearts,
and grant them the blessing to be found only in Jesus Christ, our God and
Lord."" This prayer came with a 300-day indulgence.  
  
Is it ""kind of bonkers"" to say that the Curse of Ham was a major influence on
Catholic thought? I think not.",4040
"""until such time as the wealth gap between whites and minorities was erased""  
  
That's the 'equity' in 'antiracism'. It's a non-starter.",138
"Hi Ed,  
  
In your interview, you state:  
  
""You’ll also find – and this is something that I discuss in my book – that the
Catholic Church and the popes have officially taught for five centuries now
that the kind of slavery that was practiced in the New World and the kind of
slavery represented by the African slave trade was intrinsically evil. The
popes condemned this consistently from the beginning. Now, it’s true that
there were a lot of people who simply ignored the teaching but that was indeed
the teaching. People often have this false impression…that somehow the Church
is a late comer to this. Well, no. In fact, the Church has been consistently
condemning what’s called chattel slavery – or the treatment of other human
beings as if they were mere pieces of property or as if they were animals or
something – for centuries even if the teaching was, again, often ignored.""  
  
I have to say that this is simply incorrect. I refer you to Pius Onyemechi
Adiele's work, ""The Popes, the Catholic Church and the Transatlantic  
Enslavement of Black Africans 1418-1839"" (Georg Olms Verlag AG, Hildesheim
2017), which was accepted as a Doctoral Dissertation in 2014 by the Faculty of
Catholic Theology of the University of Tübingen. The author carried out his
research at the Vatican Secret Archives (ASV) as well as the Portuguese
National Archives (ANTT). His book is available online:  
  
https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/id/8aa95306-9256-443f-9e89-de5871874288/external_content.pdf  
  
With a wealth of impressively documented scholarship, Adiele demonstrates that
the Popes actively supported the enslavement of Africans and the Transatlantic
slave trade for nearly four centuries. He writes: ""Even in the face of
numerous protests made by some anti-slavery proponents in both Europe and
America against the continued unjust enslavement of Black Africans, none of
the popes of the Church beginning from the renaissance papacy in the fifteenth
century, throughout the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries and up to the
first three decades of the nineteenth century ever remembered to hearken to
those voices of protests so as to extend their fatherly concern towards Black
Africans laboring under the chains of Transatlantic slavery... Even in the
sixteenth century precisely in 1537 during the papacy of pope Paul III, when
the papacy at last began to show interest in the sufferings of peoples held
under the bondage of slavery by condemning the enslavement of the Indians of
the West Indies, the Black Africans were left out and ignored in this papal
interest in protecting those under enslavement... The papacy showed her
concern for Black Africans in 1814 and 1823 respectively only at the
motivation of the British government and only on the condition that the
British government will help the Church to recover her lost Papal States which
were taken away from her by the Napoleonic invasion and occupation of the
Papal States in 1808.""  
  
I'll leave it to my readers to decide whether Adiele has the better of the
argument.",3055

it pales in comparison to God's goodness. You go to heaven by cooperating with

obeys all church directives, gives alms to the poor, and does regular
missionary activity providing Bibles and building schools in Africa. He dies
and goes to Heaven, where people admire just how nice he is. But he looks
around and sees actually good people, people with special abilities and
excellence, and he realizes how unworthy he is of Heaven, and he cannot abide
in their presence. So he exits Heaven and never returns.  
  
Now, being nice is certainly better than being evil... but it doesn't get you
much. How does one become good instead of nice?",671

CCC 1930: ""Respect for the human person entails respect for the rights that
flow from his dignity as a creature. These rights are prior to society and
must be recognized by it."". Edmunde Burke was very allergic to these
principles.  
  
The article should be a great contribution to the handbook. Some of the other
titles look very interesting too.",524
" _But he looks around and sees actually good people, people with special
abilities and excellence, and he realizes how unworthy he is of Heaven,_  
  
In addition to the replies above, I want to focus on this notion. First,
""special abilities"" **never was** any aspect of being ""qualified"" for heaven.
Take, for example, St. Peter. If you examine his behavior in the Gospels and
Acts, you find a guy - a mere fisherman - who constantly puts his foot in his
mouth, who berates God, and who runs away from a friend in great need.
Eventually, he did clean up his act, but - as with all the saints - he
attributed this to **favors he was granted out of God's overflowing gifts** ,
not out of his own merit.  
  
""and excelllence"". Again the ONLY excellence that technically qualifies is the
**love of God** by which you act rightly in all your acts, and this is (again)
always due to God's beneficent favor, not our own merit. All we can claim is
to have _remained in cooperation_ with said grace, rather than repudiating it.
St. Francis said that greater good would be found in a man merely picking a
piece of straw out of the road, if done with perfect love of God, than in a
great many great sacrifices suffered with imperfect love.  
  
What you are confusing in ""excellences"" is the acts of HEROIC virtues by which
the Church _locates and confirms canonized_ saints, with the actual excellence
needed, perfect love. But the life of a nun in a contemplative cloister, who
spends her entire life _just FOLLOWING THE RULE_ with perfect charity, (and
without any call by God to endure situations demanding heroic virtue), has
just as much claim on being in heaven as some highly acclaimed saint who
performed many wonders and miracles with love of God, or a saint who bore
great visible sufferings for love of God. The Church never _expects_ to
canonize all those who go to heaven: she uses the test of heroic virtue as an
empirical source of _evidence for_ the required love of God, but she does not
deny the same love might persist in many who do not demonstrate it VISIBLY in
great events.  
  
And if you die in the state of grace but highly imperfect in your love of God,
your time in Purgatory will correct that, and you will get to heaven with
perfect love of God - just like the acclaimed and cannonized saints.",2316

language of ""rights"" at all. While it makes sense to be wary precisely for the
reason Talmid offers, I am not sure we have a good escape route that avoids
speaking in terms of ""rights"" and indeed ""natural rights"". The problem is that
even more basic to ""right **S** "" is ""the right"" as in ""the good"" kind of
action, opposed to the wrong kind of action, and we can't really eliminate
_right_ in that context. We might come up with a parallel word or phrase to
use, I suppose, but even that wouldn't eradicate that ""natural right"" still
has a valid meaning equal to that new phrase. And since the connection to
natural law is critical, and since ""natural law"" isn't going anywhere as a
term, I think we are pretty much stuck. We just have to insist on the
distinctions.",843
"St. Thomas didn't need to. In his day, Burkean-type ideologies did not yet
exist. They maintain that individual rights are established, not by nature,
but by civil society. Since the eighteenth century, because of the spread of
such ideas (and that of distorted liberal ""natural law"" ideologies), the
Church had to speak more explicitly of rights based on nature.",363
"This is the right approach, however, from what I've read so far it's
overcomplicated by Aristotle and Aquinas. The Greek model for human rights is
not universal but tied to the idea of AUTOCHTHONY and would JUSTIFY chattel
slavery.  
Paul addressed AUTOCHTHONY directly in his Mars hill discourse in Acts 17
countering the dispute concerning birth from a particular area to one BLOOD,
in law a common human consanguinity which having the evidence of mixed races
or ethnicities is evidence of common humanity due therefore common equity
(dikaiosune, see Aristotle BOOK 5 NICHOMACHEAN ETHICS).  
He then established the common observation that in one theos all live and move
and have being which relates back to the first observation that they had many
gods each of which protected certain classes of rights when given obeisance.
The unknown one Theos being the god upon whom even the other gods demiurgos
we're dependent.  
Then he established the ideal judge who could advocate the natural rights of
those in the image of the invisible Theos who is not in the image or location
chosen by men but has established equity in the image of God in the god man in
whom are all actual subjective rights obvious by natural law made objective
because HE will judge in that equity, justice, righteousness, dikaiosune,
mishpat and God has given proof of this by raising him from the dead
signifying he is eternal and has the power over life and death for all in his
image.  
Paul draws this human rights argument directly from the old testament
description of messiah the Christ not Greek philosophy he has simply explained
it so that greeks could understand it. This is the same structure used in the
prologue to John's Gospel, beginning with IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE LOGOS, the
logos became flesh, that becoming flesh gave us equity and the authority to
claim the title of an inheritance of rights i.e THE SONS OF GOD, our duty
then, his law is to love and protect the legitimate rights of others as we
love and protect our own rights, knowing these rights came from God by grace
and the truth concerning the fact of the matter that is the Christ.  
I don't see how philosophy can improve on this although it may help to
understand it, but it doesn't improve upon but rather is corrected by the new
testament based on the two great commandments with respect to God's rights and
our rights in common as neighbors and the explanation in the prophets such as
ISAIAH who goes into great detail on the subject of equity of rights in the
human image of God YHVHJESUS.

Clearly, God does have at least one reason not to create, namely the
possibility of sin and suffering. In answer to your question, then, I grant
that God had at least one reason not to create. But that is beside the issue.  
  
The issue is the following: Given God’s reasons for and against creating, was
it inevitable that God would choose to create? In other words, was God’s
choice to create (a) wholly determined by reason or (b) at least partially
arbitrary or random?  
  
I argue that (b) is incompatible with classical theism, and I think everyone
involved agrees. Thus, we must assert (a) in the alternative.

outweigh the reasons against it—as we know they do simply based on our own

"You want full message, fine here.  
-I read your ""The experience of God"" book twice and I have some questions regarding it.  
First is a minor nitpick (And I mean no offence for saying this) but I feel
you have a tendency to use too many $10 words. Case in point; you use the word
""quotidian"" at least 5 times that I can remember, when that word is almost
never better than its friendly companions ""daily"", ""everyday"", ""ordinary"", and
""commonplace"". Now having a large vocabulary isn't a bad thing, but a flagrant
use of obscure words made it very difficult to understand your point.  
My second problem is your concept of God and how you define it. Your
definition of God is that in trying to elevate Him to the loftiest heights,
heights truly befitting the magnificence of God, I feel you have reduced Him
to empty concepts/platitudes, both completely meaningless and as uninspiring
as mathematical axioms. What could it mean to say God is existence, or
consciousness, or bliss, or any of the other abstract concepts that one often
hears thrown about by other religious believers: love, truth, the alpha and
the omega, and so on? One might as well argue that God is electricity,
gravity, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Of course, this would be
ludicrous. Who would seek ecstatic union with the weak nuclear force, or pray
to electricity, or find solace in the presence of gravity? But slap a poetic,
inspirational-sounding abstraction on God (being, truth, beauty, etc.), and
suddenly the whole thing gains a veneer of credibility it hasn't earned.  
The meaninglessness of your idea of God culminates in your assertion that God
must be simple, unable to “possess distinct parts, or even distinct
properties” (p.128), and, as eternal, He can’t be subject to change either
(time being a measure of change – not to mention the fact that change
indicates a movement from potentiality to actuality, whereas God is pure
actuality (another meaningless concept)). What can possibly be left over after
one has removed distinct parts/properties and the ability to change?  
Lastly you defend all of this by claiming that any other way of thinking about
God is guilty of anthropomorphism; the tendency to re-make God in our own
image and likeness. The charge of anthropomorphism is undeniably valid when
people try to convince us that a being even the tiniest bit like what you
describe, God cares about what you do in the privacy of your own bedroom, or
desires human worship, or takes sides favouring one equally petty, narrow-
minded tribe over another, but it is far from obvious that the claim that God
isn’t subject to change or lacks distinguishing properties fares any better.
The problem here is to explain how this God can be as transcendent as you
claim and yet not dissolve into meaningless abstractions. Unfortunately, to
the extent that you attempt this impossible task, all you do is appeal to even
more meaninglessness propositions. If God can’t change, He must therefore be
unfeeling and unable to be aware of contingent truths, you argue?  
Hart: It’s just that “his knowledge or bliss or love does not involve any
metaphysical change in him” (p.137). God therefore can’t act in the world, nor
can He be free, you say?  
Hart: God’s “creative intention… can be understood as an eternal act that
involves no temporal change within him. His freedom… [consists in] the
infinite liberty with which he manifests himself in the creation he wills from
everlasting.” (p.139)  ",3487
"First, recall the passage from Hart’s book _You Are Gods_ that provided the
basis for Fr. Rooney’s charge:",106
"_If anyone does not confess that the world and all things which are contained
in it, both spiritual and material, were produced, according to their whole
substance, out of nothing by God; **or holds that God did not create by his
will free from all necessity, but as necessarily as he necessarily loves
himself** ; or denies that the world was created for the glory of God: **let
him be anathema**_.",399
"End quote. The argument here seems to be this. There is a sense in which a
mother’s love for her child flows of necessity from her nature, but we would
not for that reason judge the acts that express this love to be unfree.
Similarly, if, as Hart claims, the act of creation flows of necessity from
God’s nature, we shouldn’t judge that it is unfree.",350
" _to state that ""For Dionysius, as for Plotinus, God is nothing but the making
of all things, so that the possibility of not making does not arise.... As in
Plotinus, to produce all things is not a ""choice"" on God's part... That God
cannot not create is a consequence, not a limitation, of his absolute
transcendence, his unrelatedness to that which proceeds from him.""_  
  
One would hope that Dionysius (or Perl) are a little more sensible than that:
if God ""is nothing but"" the making of all things, then he cannot be
""unrelated"" to all things and transcendent above them. Not, at least, using
those terms in any ordinary sense. Maybe using them by infra-contradiction, in
which the word instead means its opposite.",719
"The Good is diffusive by its own nature. The idea that God could choose is not
an intelligible one on pain of irrationality (for example the reasons for
creating are present in every world; being compelled in one but not the other
world is unintelligible) . As Barry Miller already wrote, choosing is foreign
to God, but willing is not. A Thomist blog should be aware of that",375
"End quote. Given that God is pure actuality, doesn’t it follow that he cannot
have potentials of either of the kinds here referred to by Hart?",142
"Quoting Hart:  
 _For God, deliberative liberty – any “could have been otherwise,” any
arbitrary decision among opposed possibilities – would be an impossible defect
of his freedom._  
And:  
 _A God who merely chooses to create – as one equally possible exercise of
deliberative will among others – is either actualizing a potential beyond his
nature... or he is actualizing some otherwise unrealized potential within
himself...._  
  
I notice that Hart is essentially stating the Modal Collapse objection in
these passages, which purports to find a dilemma according to which either
creation must be as actual as God Himself, or His act of creation must be
utterly arbitrary, random, and unintended on His part.  
  
Rather than rejecting this dilemma as classical theists do, or taking it as an
argument against the Unmoved Mover as atheistic proponents of the argument do,
Hart affirms the first leg of the dilemma, collapsing creation into necessity
and thus crossing into pantheism. He wants to arbitrarily take this only
halfway, though, rather than following that line of logic to its full
implication that change and multiplicity are illusions, and only Being Itself
exists, a la Parmenides.  
  
As Ed points out, to assume that creation must be as necessary as God in order
to be caused by God ignores the distinction between active potency and passive
potency. And that distinction isn't some special pleading, but rather a direct
implication of the Unmoved Mover argument.  
  
I would argue that the idea that creation must be either necessary or random
also evinces a tendency especially common among moderns to try to collapse
free will (the choices of rational agents with will and intellect) into either
blind law-like automation or random chance, the two broad categories of
mindless, mechanistic causation allowed by the ""scientific"" reductionist-
mechanistic worldview. _Even though we experience it all the time in our own
choices_ , they simply have a difficult time understanding that a free
rational agent can cause things such that they are not necessitated by the
agent's nature but are still grounded in it and non-random, and that this does
not reduce to something less.",2200

"First, the argument seems to boil down to mere semantic sleight of hand.
Again, Hart holds that “creation _inevitably follows_ from who [God] is,”
denies that there is “ _any_ ‘could have been otherwise’” where creation is
concerned, and so forth. This counts as holding that God creates of necessity
_given the standard philosophical and theological use of “necessity.”_ Hence,
if Hart really is denying that he takes God to create of necessity, the denial
rings true only if he is using the word in some idiosyncratic way.",524
"The problem with this is that it contradicts the reader’s first statement, to
the effect that creation adds nothing to God. For if God cannot be boundless
in love without creating the world, then creation _does_ add something to God
– it _completes_ or _perfects_ his love. This entails that God _needs
creation_ in order to be complete, perfect, unlimited, unbounded. And this is
no less heretical than is the claim that God creates of necessity. Thus does
the First Vatican Council [teach
that](https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/first-vatican-council-1505)
“there is one true and living God, creator and lord of heaven and earth,
almighty, eternal, immeasurable, incomprehensible, **_infinite in_** will,
understanding and **_every perfection_** ” (emphasis added).  Of course, Hart
would not be moved by the pronouncements of a Catholic council, but the
doctrine is grounded in scripture and tradition.  For example, Matthew 5:48
says: “You, therefore, must be perfect, _as your heavenly Father is perfect_.”
It is also a consequence of God’s pure actuality, for only what has some
unactualized potential could fail to be perfect.",1140

A few words about Molinism. Luis De Molina proposed middle knowledge. That in
any possible world, God would know what a sentient agent would do. Many
critics have rightfully written this idea is incoherent and unlikely.  
  
For example, consider an agent, John, in possible worlds. A world with Nazis,
Stalin's gulags and great evils and suffering. Or a world without suffering
caused by Nazis and Stalin. God would know what John would do in all details
in any actualized possible world.  
  
Since to create a world, God must choose an initial starting state of creation
God's omniscient foreknowledge would allow God to know the future, no sentient
being in that Universe has free will. Any such Universe is necessarily hard
determinate.  
  
And God would know that. God does not have to know all possible world's, just
the fact that any Universe necessarily has an initial state of creation that
determines all events in that actualized world.  
  
Of course if fate, not God is responsible for this actualized Universe and
even God gets no choice, Molinism is necessarily impossible.

And now, the proposition that God is outside of time. This propsition was
posed by Augustine in his ""Confessions - Book XI.""  
It became an idea adopted by most if not all classical theologians from
Boethius to Aquinas.  
  
For God, there is no real past, present, or future, to God all is Now. God can
directly experience every part of that Big Now. Difficuly one is if there is
no real past, there can be no before, now, afterwards. Creation entails before
creation, creation, after creation. One might argue God is an immanent
sustainer of this eternal creation.  
But that entails all ever was and is and will be as it is eternally. Why then
does a perfectly good God sustain horrendous evil and suffering?  
  
And we are baack to the problem off long befoe these evils, God knew some
13.75 billion years ago these evils would happen. A trillion years ago, God
knew this horrific evil in this Universe would exist. An googleplex years ago,
God could experience this segment of the Big Now and witness this evil and
suffering.  
  
If we claim God created this world, God chose this Universe with all its evils
and we get no free will. God gets the blame. If we argue God merely sustains
this Universe, God gets the blames for all suffering and evil. If God from any
point in eternity knew the state of what we percieve of Now, that is immutable
and unchangable.  
  
If we argue against all reason and logic God could change anything, we are
back to the issue of why God allows so much evil and suffering? Not matter
what God's Big Now is, God gets the blame.  
  
And even if we say God could change anything, there is a final actualized
state of Now and God would know what that final, unchangable Now is.

Regarding St. Augustine's argument, it addresses the point that God would know
the state of the world at creation. After all God knows the state of the world
past, present, and future, so despite your inept assertions otherwise, this
point has not eluded theologians preceding nominalism or Luther or certainly
not you. So why don't you stop pretending? It isn't fooling anyone.  
  
The suggestion that St. Augustine abandoned his account of free will later in
his career is a sad trope in older reformed Protestant theology. Your
repetition of this sad trope shows that you are most certainly not familiar
with the secondary literature on these issues. The account of the will found
in his early Cassiacum Dialogues (On the Freedom of the Will) is maintained in
his anti-Pelagian writings (e.g. On Grace and Free Will). It is also
maintained in his City of God. Han Luen Kantzer Komline has traced St.
Augustine on the will in Augustine on the Will: A Theological Account. This
work makes clear that St. Augustine did not abandon and account on the Freedom
of the Will. It really only takes a cursory reading of a few of St.
Augustine's early and late works to realize this. In light of this, it is
clear that you are familiar with neither St. Augustine nor the secondary
literature on St. Augustine. So, again, who do you think you are fooling? Why
keep pretending?  
  
I would continue to expose the nonsense in your post, but I am left to wonder
whether it would do any good in encouraging you to stop being a shameless
pretender. Perhaps as a sign of goodwill, you might recognize that you have no

problem. Of course any theologian who realized this sort of problem confirmed
classical theology was nonsense dared not admit it in writing publically. Not
unless he find himself pronounced anathema, excommunicated, stripped of any
offices he held, and losing any rights to teach in any University if he held a
license to teach.  
  
You see the problem here.  
I naturally wonder how many theologians came to realize this sort of
theological nonsense was nonsense and simply avoided trouble by not hinting at
any of his realizations theology was bunk. Jean Messlier was an example of a
well respected priest who scorching opinions were only known posthumously.  
  
Did Augustine abandon free will? Yes. Read the Council of Orange. Which
followed Augustine until that turned out to be problematic.  
  
Later, insisting free will was impossible as Augustine suggested became
heresy. A monk, Gottshalk of Orbis, who insisted on Augustine's abandoment of
free will was censuted and spent 20 years in prison, refusing to abandon that
opinion. The Synod of Paris in the tenth century, pronounced that opinion
heresy, utterly abandoning the Council Of Orange. Manuscripts about the
Gottshalk affair only recently have been gathered and translated. I do not
know if these have yet been published.  
  
You might want to read the Council of Orange.  
  
We have very little about the discussions of theologians of the time who
realized Augustine's theology made God author and creator of all horrendous
evil and suffering forcing abandment of that theology, but that in fact
happen, and the Council of Orange, the end product of Augustian theology was
quietly but thoroughly abandoned starting in the sixth century. Some of the
theolgians who were involved in this abandonment of strict Augustinian
theology are known, but the few writings they left are very hard to find. Some
seem to have not been translated from Latin.  
My effots to trace all of this theological puzzles is still ongoing, and there
are huge gaps in all of this, but it is obvious Augustine's theology was seen
as problematic and was abandoned for what we now call semi-Pelgianism.

"5\. Finally, Hart makes a point in defense of the orthodoxy of his position,
claiming:",86
"_For God, deliberative liberty – any “could have been otherwise,” any
arbitrary decision among opposed possibilities – would be an impossible defect
of his freedom. God does not require the indeterminacy of the possible in
order to be free… And in the calculus of the infinite, any tension between
freedom and necessity simply disappears; there is no problem to be resolved
because, in regard to the transcendent and infinite fullness of all Being, the
distinction is meaningless… And it is only insofar as God is not a being
defined by possibility, and is hence infinitely free, that creation inevitably
follows from who he is_. _This in no way alters the truth that creation, in
itself, “might not have been,” so long as this claim is understood as a modal
definition, a statement of ontological contingency, a recognition that
creation receives its being from beyond itself and so has no necessity
intrinsic to itself._",922
"""Nothing extrinsic to God gives God a reason not to create, and God’s nature
certainly contains no such reason.""  
  
On what possible basis could we have sufficient knowledge of the boundless and
inexhaustible divine nature to know that divine omniscience *certainly* could
not discover *any* reasons not to create from it?",324
"1\. Hart says that “‘necessity’ is not a meaningful concept in relation to
God” and that “necessity cannot attach to him who is perfect infinite act.”
The argument seems to be that since he is explicitly committed to these
claims, he cannot fairly be accused of holding that God creates of necessity.
But there are several problems with this line of defense.",358
"""There is also agreement on all sides that there is no arbitrariness in God’s
willing to create the world....What is at issue is rather this: Is there
anything internal to the divine nature that entails that God could not
possibly have refrained from creating the world?""  
  
That is not the issue. Hart agrees that God could refrain from creating were
there good reasons to so choose, but creation nevertheless is inevitable
because there are no good reasons not to create. Nothing extrinsic to God
gives God a reason not to create, and God’s nature certainly contains no such
reason. Therefore, God’s love is the controlling reason that entails creation,
for there exists nothing in competition with love that could sway God’s will
against choosing to create.  
  
To argue otherwise logically constitutes introducing arbitrariness or
randomness into the divine will.",870
"This response manages to involve several basic errors. First, your first
comment was (as it needs to be) about good reasons, not compelling reasons.
The two are not the same at all, even in our case. Second, 'compelling' reason
is a metaphor; nobody is literally compelled by any reasons, which would
require that reasons be efficient causes. All 'compelling reason' means is
that it was a reason good enough due to its intrinsic merits that one acted on
it. Because of this, while it is true that our creation shows that God had no
compelling reason not to create, it is trivially true -- all it is saying is
that God's making choice A shows that He didn't decide to act on the intrinsic
merits of any reasons He might have had for choice B. It doesn't tell us
anything about whether He had good reasons for choice B. Third, the response
is irrelevant because the claim in question is ""nothing in God's nature
contains a reason not to create"".  
  
Thus I ask again, On what possible basis could we have sufficient knowledge of
the boundless and inexhaustible divine nature to know that divine omniscience
*certainly* could not discover *any* reasons not to create from it?",1174

just “so long as” this is understood to mean that the world receives its being
from something beyond it. The implication, given the preceding remarks, is
that it has nothing to do with any possibility of God’s refraining from
creating it.",536

"WCB,  
  
I have already noted Komline's Augustine on the Will in the Oxford Historical
Theology series published in 2019. I have also noted some of the relevant
works of St. Augustine that you are not familiar with that show that he did
not change his position. The work that shows this most clearly is a work
written by St. Augustine at the end of his life called: The Retractions. St.
Augustine knew that his writings would be maintained and widely read after his
death because his fame was already so widespread during his life. He was also,
like any faithful Catholic, concerned about orthodoxy and that he did not lead
others into error in any way. This reflects his charity, which is why he was a
saint.  
  
In order to ensure that any mistakes in his writings did not lead others
astray, he read through them at the end of his life carefully and retracted
any statements that were erroneous. Such retractions are found in his work:
The Retractions. This is relevant for our discussion because he revisited his
early Cassiacum dialogues, including On the Freedom of the Will. And did he
make the sweeping assertion that he completely rejected his early account of
the will in this work? Nope. He made small and precise corrections to his
cassiacum dialogues while continuing to hold to his main lines of argument
within them.  
  
St. Augustine was a clear, compelling, cogent, and precise thinker. That
precision entailed that he avoided gross and unsupported generalizations of
the sort that fly off your keyboard, WCB. So, no he didn't ""reject his account
of the will"". That sweeping generalization has as much support as your other
sweeping generalizations. That is, it has no support.  
  
It is a bad habit to make such unsupported generalizations and to do so with
such a high level of confidence. After all, a high level of confidence with a
high level of ignorance is a fairly toxic combination.",1912

One final note on semi-pelagianism. It is clear from your writing on this

misnomer has been widely recognized by both Protestant and Catholic scholars
today. If you had even a basic familiarity with the secondary literature, you
would know this. There has been alot to clean up from your post and there is
still more to do. However, I think it is only right that you begin to take it
from here with some of the recommendations that are made below.",683
"I don't think people most people actually understand the accusation if
pantheism they're making. An identification of God with Existence or, to use
more platonic language, The One (The Good), cannot in principle be a
pantheistic conception, since the world is obviously a complex and changing
object. Panentheism may fit better, but even here outside of emanating from a
singular object, due to the absolute simplicity of the absolute, it's
impossible for the world to be a part of it, it lacks the parts with which
anything outside of it could ever truly be related to it. Arguably, the
platonist conception of the absolute is even simpler than Aristotle's unmoved
mover, for the reason that Plotinus argues against Aristotle's idea of it
being Thinking thinking about thoughts. Whether it's correct or not, Plotinus
argues that every kind of knowledge involves minimal composition. In that
sense, the One cannot be an intellect, which doesn't mean though that it's
wholly unmental.  
  
It may be easier for me than for others here since, even though I'd call
myself Christian, I have zero emotional investment in the religion and would
be indifferent to dropping it, but the accusation that a lofty conception of
God removes any kind of personal relation, for me, just shows that we too
heavily rely on a, frankly, infantile conception of the supreme being, instead
of following the intellectual route of letting ourselves be led into complete
apophaticism, in the footsteps of Plotinus and Pseudo-Dionysius. What would
knowledge be if it doesn't change? Well, not the knowledge of truths we know
it, but acts that *produce* these truths. The convergence with existence and
the ultimate dependency of everything on it entails that at the grass roots of
knowledge, power or morality, these concepts are entailed by
existence/goodness. This is just the logical consequence, something O'Conner
hinted at in his book on the contingency argument. Furthermore in regards to
knowledge I'd once again reference Barry Miller who quotes Patrick Grim, the
idea of omniscience as propositional knowledge (P is true, God knows that P),
is not a conception that can be applied to God, this just leads to
contradictions. But it also means that his mode of knowledge would be as much
comparable to ours as Aquinas' pure esse would be to Frege's existential
quantifier",2354
"All told, then, it is clear that Hart does not deny, or at least cannot
reasonably deny, that he holds that God creates the world of necessity.
Rather, the most that he can try to argue (albeit, I think, unpersuasively) is
that the _specific sense_ in which he thinks that God creates of necessity is
compatible with divine freedom and with Christian orthodoxy.",361
"3\. But in response to this, it seems that Hart would deploy a further
argument. At Fr. Kimel’s blog, a reader says: “Creation is unnecessary in that
it adds nothing to God. However, creation is inevitable given the boundless
love of God.” And to this, Hart replies: “Precisely.” So, it seems that Hart
would argue that, unlike a human mother’s love, God’s love is _boundless_ ,
and that _this_ is what makes his creative act inevitable. For God to fail to
create would entail some bound or limitation on God’s love.",516

As far as I’m concerned, this is all mystical, pseudo-philosophical gibberish.
None of these ‘explanations’ mean anything. What is an “eternal act,” or
knowledge that doesn’t produce a “metaphysical change” in the knower, or
something willed “from everlasting”? Yes, your idea of God is immune to most
atheistic attacks, but in securing this victory, you basically hollow out the
definition so much that not only is there no trace left of a loving Father we
can have a personal relationship with (not such a serious problem for
religions like Buddhism, but a massive blow for traditional Christianity), but
‘God,’ identified as nothing more than a string of abstract concepts, is (like
all abstractions) absolutely bereft of any concrete reality independent of a
thinking subject.  
Third leading from my second issue is are you a Pantheist David? I have read
both yours and Ed Fesers blog sites and I recall you saying “The accusation of
pantheism troubles me not in the least… There are many ways in which I would
proudly wear the title… I am quite happy to be accused of pantheism.”  
So, unless you were being facetious, I don't see how that doesn't confirm his
and his followers' beliefs about you. You've also said that ""Pantheism is a
vague term."" Well, the simplest definition is God=World that's it, he is
immutable, indifferent, formless and eternal. However, is it possible that the
accusations of pantheism are actually misunderstood as Panentheism?  
Put simply, a Panentheist (also known as also known as Monistic Monotheism),
is the belief, similar to Pantheism, that the physical universe is joined to
God, but stressing that God is greater than (rather than equivalent to) the
universe. Thus, the one God is synonymous with the material universe and
interpenetrates every part of nature (as in Pantheism), but timelessly extends
beyond as well. This conception of God influenced New England
Transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, and was popularized by Charles
Hartshorne (1897 – 2000) in his development of process theology in the 20th
Century. The Neoplatonism (which you declare yourself a follower of) of
Plotinus (in which the world itself is a God) is to some extent panentheistic
with polytheistic tendencies, and philosophical treatises have been written on
it in the context of Hinduism for millennia (notably in the “Bhagavad Gita”
and the “Shri Rudram”). For more details on Panentheism I have provided a
video link below, feel free to watch it.  
Despite all of what I have said David I still hold you in high regard, you're

Theology often is poorly thought out. Consider Duns Scotus on future
contingents. Future contingents are created by God's will. So on July 4, 2020,
John may have oatmeal for breakfast. Or may not have oatmeal for breakfast.
John's choice of breakfast will be caused by the will of God. That is how God
knows the future.  
  
Now consider that on July 6, John may kidnap Jane, rape her, torture her over
several days and finally sadistically murder Jane. Or John may not do so. If
as per Duns Scotus, God chooses to actualize John's actions, then if John does
kidnapsJane and rapes, tortures and kills her, her it is solely because of
God's will. This theological claim makes God a participant in all acts of
horrendous evil and suffering. Duns Scotus was influential with some
theologians with his will of God to explain future contingents. And apparently
did not think this out to its logical and horrific conclusion.

"To be sure, there is _one_ clear sense in which Hart thinks that God does not
create of necessity, insofar as he holds that God is free of “necessitation
under _extrinsic_ coercion,” of “a necessity _beyond_ himself.” Like Fr.
Rooney, me, and the Christian tradition in general, Hart agrees that nothing
_outside_ of God in any way compels him to create. For that matter, there is
also a sense in which Fr. Rooney, I, and the Christian tradition in general
agree with Hart that God acts of necessity in _some_ respects. In particular,
there is no disagreement with Hart when he writes: “Can God lie? Can God will

"Regarding the council of Orange and semi-pelagianism: Here again, this
assertion reflects a high level of confidence and a high level of ignorance
mixed in a toxic cocktail. Pelagianism is a heresy. And Church councils
condemn heresy, rather than upholding a moderated version of heresy (i.e.
semi-heresy).Semi-pelagianism, which is imprecise and often undefined, denies
the role of God's grace in the initial movement of the will toward God. This
is denied by both the Council of Orange and St. Augustine. In fact it is
condemned by the Council of Orange as heresy. So, the council of Orange
*nowhere* condemned St. Augustine. It did however condemn a version of the
very same heresy that St. Augustine fought so tirelessly against.  
  
Now, the key here for anyone who cares about orthodoxy is that heresy and
orthodoxy are not defined by the self-appointed pope WCB. It is defined by the
Church that the Scripture's refer to as ""the pillar and foundation of truth""
and which Christ said ""the gates of hell will not prevail against it"". Satan
is the father of lies and where lies prevail (e.g. in the thought of WCB),
there Satan prevails. This has not and cannot happen in Christ's Church which
is the pillar and foundation of truth. So, as I mentioned below, WCB, no one
here is interested in joining the cult of WCB. Your judgements are pervasively
erroneous and you should consider tempering that unflinching confidence in
your own wisdom. Trusting that rickety old bridge is going to lead you to fall
into a pit.  
  
As a final note to the interested reader, it is not enough to read Scripture
and quote it. We have to interpret it correctly and there is such a thing as a
heretical interpretation (for examples of this, review the writings of WCB).
Pelagius was, after all, not reading the funny papers when he arrived at his
position that ""there was when the word was not"". He was reading the book of
Proverbs and offering a heretical interpretation of this book (He also wrote a
commentary on Romans.). So, it is not enough to quote Scripture. Satan quoted
Scripture. You have to interpret it truly with the pillar and foundation of
truth and this involves submitting to the judgements of Church councils which
are under the guidance of the Holy Spirit as we see in Acts 15 from St. James'
words (""it seemed good to us and to the Holy Spirit"") as the council sent out
letters to the Churches notifying all Christians of the decision of the
council. They did not say, ""well take a bible--if your literate--and decide
what you think on this issue and, if you are not literate, just follow whoever
is most able to convince you with ""smooth and flattering words that will
""tickle your ears"" (two quotes from Scripture, I will leave to the reader to
look them up). Instead, everyone knew that they must obey the judgement of the
leaders of the Church at the Jerusalem council. After all, Hebrews teaches,
""Obey your leaders"". It is for this reason that they did not say, ""Let me see
what you think about that and then I will decide whether or not you got it
right."" That would be the arrogant and foolish approach of WCB. Instead, they
received the letter with joy and docility because they understood the teaching
of Scripture: ""Obey your leaders.""",3256
"The tone was a response to David's tone to me. His exact words were ""I don't

point.Augustine, Boethius, Ansalm, William of Okham, Duns Scotus, Aquinas,
Molina and others. And some of the enormous modern secondary literature.  
  
Augustine assert that though God foresees all he does not cause all. Boethius
claims that as a man sees something, that man does not cause what he sees.
Thus God sees future events but likewise does not cause them. And on and on it
goes. Everybody is indeed wrong  
  
The particular argument I posted is not answered by the nearly 1600 years of
theologians trying to explain the issue of God's foreknowledge and free will.
Not until Luther's ""Bondage Of The Will"" did the issue of this become a
problem.  
  
Late in his life after the Pelagian affair Augustine gave up on free will,
which was followed by Calvin, Luther et all.  
  
I am sure that somewhere somebody else has made the argument I have, but I
have yet to see anybody that has among the theologian community.  
  
The key concep I wrote about is if Go d decides to create a Universe, God must
choose an initial states of creation. And that we are told by centuries of
theologians God foresees the future. Based on biblical claims God does that.  
Now all I do is follow these claims to their logical conclusion. No classical
theologians had the wit to notice this problem. Today's answer from theists is
that has all been answered long ago by classical theists. This is not true.  
  
And Augustin's idea God is outside of time is an idea just as bad, with the
same issue at its heart.

"In [my review](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2022/03/80430/) of Hart’s
_You Are Gods_ , commenting on Hart’s view that creation follows inevitably
from God’s nature, I noted that “it is hard to see how this is different from
the Trinitarian claim that the Son is of necessity begotten by the Father; and
if it isn’t different, then creation is no less divine than the Son is.”
Hart’s necessitarian view of creation is thus one of several respects in
which, as I noted in the review, his position collapses into a kind of
pantheism. And as Pohle and Preuss note in their manual _God: His Knowability,
Essence, and Attributes_ , against the traditional doctrine of divine
perfection, it is precisely “Pantheists [who] object that ‘God plus the
universe’ must obviously be more perfect than ‘God minus the universe’” (p.
188).",828

What follows the comma here does not follow in any way from what precedes the
comma. Again, read the books on logic I recommended to learn how to construct
sound and valid arguments. You should focus particularly on defining terms.
For you to make a demonstrative argument, you need to be able to define the
terms and reach agreement on the terms with those you are making the argument
with. Then you can move forward together in a demonstration. This is, again,
the basics of logic.  
  
The suggestion that you know what no other theologian in the Tradition was
aware of when you don't even understand the rudiments of logic is part of the
reason it is very difficult to take what you say seriously.  
  
Also, I have also responded to you in another post on the problem of evil and
you ignored this when I posted it. The problem is not that people are not
responding to your arguments. The problem is that you are not making

"Even if we look at Eric Perl's treatment of Plotinus's so-called 'necessary
emmanation' we see that there is an aspect of necessity involved in it. Perl
says on pg. 50 of Theophany, ""The necessity of procession, therefore, is in no
sense a limitation on the One, but rather an expression of his absolute
freedom from any limiting condition whatsoever."" He's clearly denying that the
One is constrained by any 'condition,' but that is something the Thomist would
also accept. The 'necessity' refers not to the any external condition, but his
pure productivity itself. As Perl says, ""For if the One might not produce
being, then his productive activity would be distinct from himself and he
would be condition by a relation to his product.""  
  
Why is this relevant? Well, one of the arguments of Perl's book is a situating
of Pseudo-Dionysius within a Plotinian and Procline metaphysics. So, Perl goes
on to state that ""For Dionysius, as for Plotinus, God is nothing but the
making of all things, so that the possibility of not making does not arise....
As in Plotinus, to produce all things is not a ""choice"" on God's part... That
God cannot not create is a consequence, not a limitation, of his absolute
transcendence, his unrelatedness to that which proceeds from him."" Pg. 52  
  
I mean this is the absolute best I can do to make sense of Hart's position -
interpret it through the Dionysian idea of diffusive goodness and love. And
Hart's supporters frequently point out that he's operating within this
'Neoplatonic and Dionysian tradition,' so my move appears to be justified.  
  
But, an appeal to Denys or the Neoplatonic tradition isn't any argument or
textual exegesis, and it seems to me that Dionysius is still subject to the
same criticisms raised in Ed's post. Of course, one could deny Perl's reading
of the Dionysian metaphysics...  ",1851
"Well, in the case of the human mother, she could have decided not to have a
child at all. True, given that she does have the child, her nature, if
unimpeded (by sin or by mental illness, say), will lead her inevitably to love
the child. But that’s a conditional necessity, and the antecedent could have
failed to be true. Unlike the dog (which has no choice in the matter) a human
being can freely decide not to have children. But analogously, even if God
cannot fail to love the world _if_ he creates it, his freedom is still
manifest in the fact that he nevertheless could have refrained from creating
it in the first place.",626

inevitably from his nature. That position, as Rooney points out, is heretical.
In the comments section [at Fr. Aidan Kimel’s
blog](https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2022/10/18/fr-rooney-takes-on-dbh-and-

because he must, but because nothing could prevent him from acting as what he
is. Is a mother’s love for her child unfree because it flows necessarily from
her nature, unimpeded by exterior conditions?_",274
"But whether or not Hart thinks pantheism can be reconciled with orthodoxy, his
critics do not. Hence, it will hardly do for him to try to defend the
orthodoxy of his necessitarianism via lines of argument that seem to imply
pantheism, since this will simply beg the question against his critics, who
don’t accept pantheism any more than they accept necessitarianism.",366
"Note that this is compatible with saying that God creates the world out of
love, just as it is compatible with saying that a woman might decide to have a
child out of love. That she wills to express her love by having a child to
whom she might show that love does not entail that it was inevitable that she
would have the child. And by the same token, that God wills to express his
love by creating and showing his love to his creatures does not entail that it
was inevitable that he would create.",497
2\. That last remark from Hart is part of a second line of defense. He writes:,78
"Now, I assume that Hart accepts this distinction. If he does, though, then he
should realize that his argument does not succeed, because the position he
rejects does not entail attributing any passive potential in God (which would
indeed be problematic) but rather only active potency. And if he does not
accept the distinction, then his argument simply begs the question against his
critics, who do accept it.",410

Have you noticed that no one hear takes your assertions parading as arguments
seriously? And have you considered that maybe, just maybe, everyone else is
not the problem? There's some food for thought.  
  
Yet another person above noted that you are presupposing determinism and then
also pretending like it is the conclusion of an argument. Everyone here sees
this clearly and you wish for us to believe that you are the only person, not
just here, but in all of theological history with 20/20 vision on this
question? That suggestion authentically moves beyond laughable to worthy of
pity.  
  
The reason you are parading your initial premise as the conclusion to an
argument is because you are not competent in either theology or the rudiments
of logic. To help with the latter point you might read Kreeft's Socratic Logic
or Logic as a Liberal Art by Houser.  
  
And it is not an ad hominem attack to point out how and why your are wrong
about Augustine abandoning his position on the freedom of the will. You made a
baseless assertion, it was shown to be false and you ignored this just like
you ignored it when I called you out in another post about not having the
slightest understanding of the tools involved in biblical exegesis. So
pointing out that you don't know what you are talking about is quite relevant
to our discussion. And pointing out that you ignore this and pretend like it
did not happen is also relevant. It shows a lack of good will.  
  
And, again, I responded to your puerile attempt to make argument about the
initial state of the world above. You ignored this and I have seen you do this
on multiple occasions. If you don't like it, you ignore it. Ignoring such
responses of course results in ignorance.

publishers into believing in your singular brilliance? We are all on the edge

Whatever will we do with your devastating criticisms that no one else has ever
considered before? Oh wait, St. Augustine coherently this out about 1700 years
before you were born. God's knowing events that are future to us entail no
more determinism than our knowing past events would entail determinism. God
does not see something in time that we ""will do"". He is not seeing it in a
manner that is bound by the present because he is not bound by time. He sees
the event as eternally present to him and it entails no determinism for you to
see what does in fact happen in the present, now does it. So, just as we can
know past and present events without determinism, so God can know future
events without determinism. While it is convenient to pretend like there are
not answers given in the Christian Tradition by not mentioning them, there is
a certain intellectual dishonesty to this if you are aware of these answers.
If you are not aware of them, well now you are aware of one such answer. You
might ask yourself: am I really willing to consider such answers or am I hell

"Now, given standard philosophical and theological usage of “necessary” and
cognate terms, it is clear that Hart is asserting that God creates the world
_of necessity_. For example, in _The Encyclopedia of Philosophy_ ’s article on
“Contingent and Necessary Statements,” necessity is characterized as “what
must occur,” whereas contingency involves “what may or may not occur.” _The
Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy_ defines “necessity” as “a modal property
attributable to a whole proposition… just when it is not possible that the
proposition be false.” Wuellner’s _Dictionary of Scholastic Philosophy_
defines “necessary” as “that which cannot not-be,” “that which must be and be
as it is,” and “that which must act as it does and which cannot act
otherwise.” Obviously, Hart thinks God’s creation of the world _must_ occur,
given his nature. He thinks that it is _not possible_ that the proposition
that _God creates the world_ be false. He thinks that God _must_ act to create
the world, that his act of creation _cannot not-be_. Hence, again, given
standard usage, Hart clearly thinks that God creates the world _of necessity_.",1134
"""For God, there is no real past, present, or future, to God all is Now. God
can directly experience every part of that Big Now. Difficuly one is if there
is no real past, there can be no before, now, afterwards.""  
  
The first sentence is not how a classical Theist would make the sort of
assertion you are trying to make. If you are going to engage in dialogue where
anyone at all takes you seriously, you are going to have to make more effort
understanding the positions you appear hell bent on rejecting. Perhaps if you
at least understand them correctly, that spark within you that cares about
understanding rather than pretending might be fanned into a flame.  
  
To say is correctly, you would say that God is not bound by time. That is a
correct way to state the initial premise in an argument that you are set on
criticizing. Now this requires an understanding of time and time's relation to
matter, if you are going to actually understand a classical theist on this
point.  
  
In your third sentence quoted above you move from talking about God being
outside time to simply making the assertion that this entails that there is
not past, present, or future. Here you move from the assertion that since God
is outside time, everyone and everything must be outside time. Well once it is
framed that way (and this is an accurate way to frame the issue based on St.
Augustine and St. Thomas' understanding of the relationship between time and
matter--again more below--and God's relationship to time and matter), it
becomes clear that what you are saying is sheer nonsense. So if you are going
to frame a critique of classical theism, you are going to have to offer
something beyond a sophmoric and blundering misinterpretation and
misrepresentation of the premises of the classical theists argument.  
  
Regarding the relationship between time and matter, Philo and St. Augustine
held that these are interdependent and this is confirmed by modern physics
(See Barr's Modern Physics and Ancient Faith). We are subject to the limits
associated with time because we are corporeal beings and there is
interrelationship between time and matter. After all, we measure time with
respect to the movement of matter (e.g. the rotation of the earth around the
sun). So the argument requires a deeper understanding and exposition of their
understanding of time in order to get their argument right in the first place.  
  
You have not taken the time to understand all of this which is why there is no
one here that is impressed with what you have to say on this matter. If you
wish to have your arguments taken seriously, why don't you first make a
serious effort to consider the arguments of figures like St. Augustine and St.
Thomas? This of course requires that you actually make a good faith effort to
understand them on their terms. Now this would also require a smidge of
humility in recognizing that they have something to teach you and that it is,
to put it gently, relatively unlikely that you have created a fool proof
argument against God's existence that no one else has ever considered.
Humility and a firm grasp on reality always walk together hand in hand.",3169

that ‘necessity’ is not a meaningful concept in relation to God,” and indeed
that “creation is not necessary for God.” On the other hand, he _also_ says
that “creation follows _necessarily_ from who God freely is”; that “it is
_impossible_ that God – the Good as such – would not create”; and that “God as

dogmatic assertions. And these assertions are plain enough they cannot be

So from here we can safely take this to its logical conclusion. All then from
eternity is foreordained. God gets no choice in the initial state of creation
that creates this Universe as it is actualized. So where does this ternal

While you are stuck in your solipsistic cage, let's give you some questions to

try to communicate back, I will not understand as I have not seen your Truman
show. However, since you have seen mine, I know that you will understand the
points I am driving at by my questions. This will give you some food for
thought while you are in your cage.  
  
The first question is: could you tell us what study has identified the three
movements of the intellect (understanding, judgement, syllogism) with
particular elements on the periodic table? And, which elements are associated
with which movement? And if not elements, perhaps compounds? If so, which
compounds are associated with which movements? And is it that the compound has
to be located in the person, or in the brain, or in a particular place in the
brain at a particular time to have a particular thought? And if the compound
present in one person when they think that thought, how do you know that this
compound is *causing* the thought? Or are you identifying it with the thought?
And how do you know it does not merely correspond with the thought rather than
causing it or being identified with it? And if it were causing the thought or
identified with it in *this person* how do you know that the same occurs in
all people? If a certain element, compound, or process is associated with a
thought in person A, how do you know that this occurs in all people in the
world? And if it does not occur with all people in the world, how can you
reduce understanding of some concept or some judgement with a particular
element, compound or process?  
  
These are just a few questions for you to chem on in your cage. Given how
important evidence is to you, I am sure that you have evidential answers to
all of these questions. If not, that would again show you to be a complete
hypocrite and from your posts and our interaction, I know that this cannot be
so....  
  
Or perhaps you would tell us that you know none of the answers to these
questions and that we just need to trust you that you are correct anyways.
Well, given your omniscience about the upbringing of everyone on here that you
interact with, that makes all the sense in the world. Just like you can know

require evidence of others but don't have to give it yourself. Well, that's

"Mr. Jindra,  
  
You are spot on that the materialist had not thought through his position, but
you are mistaken in thinking that you have thought through yours. Dr. Yogami
offers you some help above, some of which I am going to reiterate by
explaining the difference between a debate and a lecture.  
  
At a debate you consider whether a particular proposition is true or false. A
debate such as the one noted above would normally be in a form such as:
whether or not materialism is true. That would be the proposition under
consideration and one person would take the affirmative side (i.e. Yes, it is
true) and another would take the negative side (i.e. no it is not true).  
  
In such a debate, it is important that the terms are defined. Otherwise,
equivocation can occur and the debaters will talk past one another. So, it
would be important to clarify that materialism is the assertion that matter is
all that there is. Once that is established and the questions are established,
folks then make arguments for their positions. That is the way a debate works.  
  
Now what you describe is a situation where you refuse to participate in the
debate and stand with your hands crossed. Well, that is not a debate. That is
a lecture wherein, in this instance, you sit and listen to Dr. William Lane
Craig and learn from him. Now that would be very good for you, but the point
is that such a situation is not a debate.  
  
In fact, it would be very awkward for you to stand in front of a crowd with a
podium next to Dr. Craig and just gawk at him. You are going to have to say or
do something. Now if you say something, you are doing to have to either: a.
utter complete non-sense (perhaps you might simply repeat the letter Q over
and over again), or b. make an argument for your case. Either way you end up
looking like bafoon who cannot offer the slightest support for your position
without showing your behind (here you and Walter and Dr. Craig's opponent have
something in common).  
  
Now, there is an alternative. Rather than saying something, you could do
something. For example, you could do interpretive dance while Dr. Craig makes
his arguments. You could do ballet and offer a rendition of the nutcracker. Or
you might simply do the macarena. All viable options.  
  
Or, perhaps, you might sit in the audience and learn from Dr. Craig. This last
option seems to me the wisest alternative. But, then, we would not have a
debate now would we? You would be the wiser and maintain your dignity, but
this would be a lecture from Dr. Craig and not a debate.",2569
"This begs the question against the paper since the conclusion of the paper's
argument is precisely that thinking cannot even in principle be a material
process, and thus cannot be carried out just by a material thing. There must
be more to the story - a power that is not constrained in the way matter is,
to be able to carry out thinking with determinate semantic content.  
The current state of brain science doesn't change that. The argument is for
the in-principle impossibility of reducing thinking to a material process.
Material things and processes are semantically indeterminate and particular,
whereas ideas and thinking are universal and semantically determinate, etc.",679
"Right: it is Good's delight to spread good, not solely when and because it is
""owed"", but even where good is not owed. Thus, God's act of creation is
spreading good where no good is owed - no thing _deserves_ to be granted
existence, so for every thing, its existence is a gift to it.  
  
And just as a good person can give goods to others where they are not owed,
out of kindness, generosity, or mercy: so also a person can _relieve debt_ as
a kind of gift to the person who owes. To show this more easily: if John owes
me $100, and Bill kindly pays John's debt to me, I am paid off, and John no
longer owes me. If Bill does this as a gift, nobody is HURT and my debt is
satisfied.  
  
Similarly, if I decide to ""pay off"" John's debt to me by considering it paid,
I make a gift to John like Bill does above. Gifts are not **contrary** to
justice, they are BESIDE it. It's just that I am both the giver and the one
whose receivable is ""paid off"" by my gift.  
  
For moral wrongs, we cannot forgive the part of the wrong that lies in the
_sin against God_ , because that is a debt owed toward God, not us. But we can
forgive the part that is owed to us.  
  
Broadly speaking, it may be either prudent or imprudent to easily forgive some
debts against us: too easily forgiving money debts could cause some people to
become spendthrifts and wastrels. Similarly, too readily forgiving _offenses_
against us might have a similar result. But aside from that measure of
prudence, Christ tells us to be willing to forgive any and all offenses
against ourselves, and indeed the examples of both Christ and the saints shows
them forgiving persecutors right in the midst of those acts of persecution -
where clearly no remorse exists.  
  
Perhaps someone can clarify distinctions about granting forgiveness of the
_offense_ (qua guilt) while not relieving the debt of some kind of
restitution? That, it seems, is part of what Oktavian is raising.",1940

"I don't know what you mean by ""the way that construct was treated by later
commentators"". There wasn't one way that prime matter was treated, because the
commentators argued about the best account to give it, as they argued about
everything else. 'Prime matter' was the term that they came to use to indicate
the first in the order of material causes, given that there is no infinite
regress in material causes; it was also taken to be what Aristotle was talking
about when talking about the matter for generation and corruption of elements.  
  
If you merely mean that later commentators developed this in ways that
Aristotle did not, on the basis of arguments that Aristotle did not consider,
then, yes, but this is just what commentators do. Even if you think they got
the interpretation of Aristotle's account of matter wrong, commentators, being
commentators, are generally interpreting the actual texts, applying them to

"My concern is not to assess Francis' personal responsibility or guilt (which
we would best leave to God), or even to decide where he would stand in a
ranking of popes from best to worst.  
  
Rather, I think our aim should be to defend magisterial statements (albeit
non-infallible) from charges of error or inconsistency as far as possible.  
  
Quite a number of Francis' difficult statements are non-magisterial, so for
these purposes it suffices to point that out in the particular instances.  
  
With magisterial statements, I realise there is the last resort of withholding
assent from non-infallible teachings, by someone who is sufficiently qualified
and who has sufficient justifiying reasons. But once someone takes that step
in one case, it does seem to easily become a habit, and a bottomless pit of
doubt and dissent.  
  
The typical Catholic trying to be faithful, and trying to learn more about
their faith from Church documents, isn't in a good position to make these
assessments, and they would end up with diminished confidence in a vast range
of teachings if they became too easily habituated to having to exercise
'private judgment' upon each one.  
  
So to me it's worthwhile, for the sake of both myself and others, to try to
find another way if possible.  
  
In this specific matter of whether we should try to 'convert others' - if we
too easily take the most 'anti-evangelizing' interpretation of Francis' words,
there will be those who will feel obliged to 'obediently accept' his teaching
thus interpreted, with detriment to their own evangelizing efforts. So again,
it's worthwhile trying as far as possible to avoid that outcome.  ",1664

And to be fair, this all has to do with the doctrine of momentariness (and
once again, read the chapter 4 from the Siderits book I've just mentioned or
the Jay Garfield one, which has a chapter just for that).  
  
But it's important though that for buddhists things have no motion since
motion would imply substances or something that survives. And that's where I
collapse because I'm not so good in A-T meta to explain all the problems with
the argument that Siderits sets out in the book. Unfortunately - but sincerely
- I can only feel that something is very wrong (and I'm not proud of not
pointing out what is it). But I can at least think that is by making seriously
controversial claims like ""things produce their effects and them go out of
existence"" that the argument supposedly has some weight. But even if that's
so, it's not clear that that could not be interpreted as an ephemeral
substance (the ones that Ed exemplifies when talking about when explaining
prime matter in Scholastic's Meta) for example.  
  
But one thing that puzzles me a lot about buddhism - without even mentioning
their purported attempt to show that they are ""not eliminativists"" about
persons, but that persons just are ""useful fictions"". Is how they square to
the fact from impermanence of all phenomena with things like semantics,
language, or words. After all, they wrote a book arguing that people do not
exist (or exist just conventionally because nothing lasts for more than a
moment) exactly in a language that exist (with modifications, of course) since
the 5th century i.e English. And that's what makes me puto ('pissed') with it
because the evidence against their position it seems to be everywhere but they
never want to look at it. And to say that since all phenomena are impermanent,
so language and semantics are just conventionally true but not ultimately true
just raises the question of how it is even possible in principle for something
that is impermanent and shouldn't last for more than a moment gives the
impression of permanence in the first place? To put it simply how could
impermanent and momentary things could even in principle brought up the
illusion of permanence if they are impermanent? Because if they want to
salvage their position they would necessarily argue that the idea of
permanence in the conscience, memory, and objects from everyday life are just
illusions.

"¡¡¡Cavete!!!  
What on earth is going on! Am I the only one to notice this?!  
Under the cover of ""upstanding"" right wing politics, various authors are
promoting occultism, while spouting edifying Christian vocab left right and
centre.  
  
Here's one example. Michael Warren Davis has done the rounds about Catholic
places, having been published quite a bit - in First Things, Crisis Magazine,
the Catholic Herald. He is out and about elsewhere too - in The Imaginative
Conservative, where he declares he can only slightly disagree (on an issue of
art and beauty) with the late Roger Scruton. He recommends Scruton's work ""On
Hunting"" as ""an account of tradition from the living heart of that tradition"".
The living heart of Idealism, more likely! This is the work that defines God
as ""the subjectivity of the world""!  
  
This is not what concerned me the most (I've mentioned it here before, but
almost nobody seemed to think it of much interest - no doubt they were too
busy reading the ST to notice).  
  
Davis has authored a couple of articles at The American Conservative that are
extremely dangerous to politicised Catholic conservatives. One of them ""When
Witchcraft was Right-Wing"", depicts the witch Gerard Gardner and his followers
as typically right wing. Davis doesn't defend devilry, but the article is
bizarrely non-committal on this issue. Davis only gets a little emotional when
pointing out how modern leftist witches are not true successors of Gardner!  
  
His most recent article in TAC (""War Against the Modern World) definitely
joined the dots. It is a shameless defence of ""Traditionalism"", well-known for
occultism and virulent anti-Christianity in all its forms.. The only criticism
he allows is that Evola is not so nice because Mussolini and Dugin like him,
so Evola - bad. But Guenon - good! And looney tunes King Charles loves Guenon,
so he's great too. Steve Bannon is somewhere between Guenon and Evola, so
Davis says he ain't perfect.  
  
These ""Traditionalists"" are now producing such volumes of material that those
with doubts - real Thomists included, must feel it is useless to respond. It
shouldn't be so difficult. After all, the dressing up of esoteric ideas with
religious imagery is not new. Though Jonathan Pageau's defence of the Kabbala,
and the occult, if only as a ""concept"" or aspect of ""Christianity"" was really
going a bit far, even for one of ""them"".  
  
The minds of well-meaning readers, including Catholics, need to be warned
about Davis and authors like him. How can the conservative media remain silent
and obsequious when faced with these characters who are far more dangerous to
the faith of conservative readers than Marxism and CRT, etc., which they are
obviously not interested in?

should be interpreted in the light of more authoritative and extended
statements such as this.  
  
A few quotes:  
  
‘Throughout the world, let us be “permanently in a state of mission”.’ (25;
cf. passim)  
  
‘All the baptized, whatever their position in the Church or their level of
instruction in the faith, are agents of evangelization.’ (120)  
  
‘All revealed truths derive from the same divine source and are to be believed
with the same faith…’ (36)  
  
‘Of course, we will never be able to make the Church’s teachings easily
understood or readily appreciated by everyone. Faith always remains something
of a cross; it retains a certain obscurity which does not detract from the
firmness of its assent.’ (42)  
  
‘Proclaiming the Gospel message to different cultures also involves
proclaiming it to professional, scientific and academic circles. This means an
encounter between faith, reason and the sciences with a view to developing new
approaches and arguments on the issue of credibility, a creative apologetics
which would encourage greater openness to the Gospel on the part of all. When
certain categories of reason and the sciences are taken up into the
proclamation of the message, these categories then become tools of
evangelization; water is changed into wine.’ (132)  
  
‘Evangelization with joy becomes beauty in the liturgy, as part of our daily
concern to spread goodness. The Church evangelizes and is herself evangelized
through the beauty of the liturgy, which is both a celebration of the task of
evangelization and the source of her renewed self-giving.’ (24)  
  
‘As the bishops of the United States of America have rightly pointed out,
while the Church insists on the existence of objective moral norms which are
valid for everyone, there are those in our culture who portray this teaching
as unjust, that is, as opposed to basic human rights. Such claims usually
follow from a form of moral relativism that is joined, not without
inconsistency, to a belief in the absolute rights of individuals.’ (64)  
  
‘Among the vulnerable for whom the Church wishes to care with particular love
and concern are unborn children, the most defenceless and innocent among us.
Nowadays efforts are made to deny them their human dignity and to do with them
whatever one pleases, taking their lives and passing laws preventing anyone
from standing in the way of this. Frequently, as a way of ridiculing the
Church’s effort to defend their lives, attempts are made to present her
position as ideological, obscurantist and conservative. Yet this defence of
unborn life is closely linked to the defence of each and every other human
right… This is not something subject to alleged reforms or “modernizations”.
It is not “progressive” to try to resolve problems by eliminating a human
life.’ (213)  
  
‘A facile syncretism would ultimately be a totalitarian gesture on the part of
those who would ignore greater values of which they are not the masters. True
openness involves remaining steadfast in one’s deepest convictions, clear and
joyful in one’s own identity, while at the same time being “open to
understanding those of the other party” and “knowing that dialogue can enrich
each side” (John Paul II). What is not helpful is a diplomatic openness which
says “yes” to everything in order to avoid problems, for this would be a way
of deceiving others and denying them the good which we have been given to
share generously with others. Evangelization and interreligious dialogue, far
from being opposed, mutually support and nourish one another.’ (251)

The point Michael made about sane mind is true. Because when you read all that
deplorable doctrines (I am using doctrines for the other philosophical views
like reductionism, buddhism, etc.) there's no way your mind not being
affected. Not because they are too counterintuitive - even though that is true
- but because of the derailment of reason and the bizarre (to say the least)
conclusions.  
  
When I found Ed's blog and learned a little bit more about act and potency
(keep in mind that we don't have that in Brazil, at least I never found it
anywhere through my youth or academic life) there is a certain beauty in the
doctrine of Aristotle - not in the sense of ""wow, after all that bullsh*t I
found across the internet like reductionism and etc. there is finally
something sane"" - but most especially in the way that the doctrine fits with
itself i.e in the way that is constructed (the careful appreciation of every
matter and etc.). But most importantly that gave me hope. And that is
something I can't forget. Because at least it seemed plausible at the time.  
  
But I want to confess something. Even though I never was an atheist throughout
my life, I never had strong reasons to believe in Our Father. That's no
surprise that I became a skeptical pseudo-atheist through my 19's. In a sense,
I think my skepticism is a disease that I can't get rid of and that grow to
the point that made my life in the miserable condition that I am now. That's
hard to say but I swear to God that that's true.  
  
The one (and the only one to be honest) reason for all of that is the fact
that I am afraid of believing some falsity and dying without knowing the
truth. I know that sounds really dumb for a motive but on closer analysis, I'm
pretty sure that 99% of atheists and co. minds work like that too. That's why
I am that way. The origin of that was the fact that part of my family is
''Espirita'' (if you guys don't have that crap religion there is a mixture of
cartesian res cogitans plus the movie ghost from Patrick Swayze) and for a
long time I was surrounded by 'palatable' ideas like: ""after death, there is a
soul in the same form as your body that will come out of it and live forever"".
I know that sounds stupid but as a kid in my 14-15years, I thought that that
was true. It 'tasted' good because, you know, nobody wants to die. But the
point is my intellect was so suffocated by that that I truly believed that in
some way I ""was a soul"".

humans are themselves substances. But these substances are, they will reply,
reducible to systems consisting of bundles of tropes behaving in accordance

impermanence (Garfield appeals a lot more for these kinds of things, that's
why I'm not using his work that much). But that does not seem right, because
that turns your metaphysics hostage to the scientific findings - the same
findings that may overthrow your own view.  
  
But if we come to focus on other points like their appeal to nominalism, they
suffer from the same problems that Ed emphasized in TLS and Scholastics meta.
The points like how they can even communicate with themselves if there are no
universals - or even worse if there are just ""momentary beings"". But I think
that their denial of universals has some relation with their momentariness
thesis. And that's what I can't even understand in the first place. How can
someone think that something analogous to the Heraclitean position is right in
the first place? It's illogical. And someone might even say that, correctly,
that the ""buddhist logic"" is very different from ""Aristotelian logic"". Fair
enough. But that doesn't explain why someone might think that something so
absurd as ""impermanent beings"" (let alone mereological nihilism, nominalism)
is plausible in the first place. To affirm that ""there are no pots that last
longer than a moment"" and that ""there is just a series of ephemeral pots one
after another"" is not to disprove permanence, but to evade the problem
altogether.

I am curious regarding the Christian approach in the following situation: a
church-wedded couple in which one partner is (out)growing rapidly and/or their
priorities change significantly. Assuming that the partners' competences are
correctly assessed, can divorce (initiated by the growing person) be
considered a reasonable strategy in such situations? In general, what

""What do readers think?""  
  
Let us consider the nature of time as per Augustine, Boethius, Aquinas and
others. God is outside of time and sees the past, present and futur. Past and
future are illusionary for us, but not God. God experiences everything as a
vey real Big Now. There is thus a very real, infinite stateof reality,
immutable and unchanging,even for God. Thus everything in the Big Now is
necessary.  
Thee then is no potency, even in principle. All is necessay and actual.  
  
God is immutable. Reality is immutable. Everything is immutable. These are
necessary truths.  
  
This is of course the simple, bumpersticker version of this version of

The Chrisitan doctrine on suffering is multi-layered, and should not be
reduced to a simple sentence. That said, 4 points are at the heart: (1) not
all suffering can be avoided while staying on the right side of the line of
good action. (2) When suffering _can_ be avoided by a morally licit choice, it
is often prudent (i.e. good, right action) to so. (3) In spite of (2), there
are ALSO many situations where some part of suffering can be avoided, but
willingly taking on and accepting the suffering (taking the suffering
yourself, not subjecting another to the suffering) can be spiritually
valuable, and **in general** a good Christian should expect to accept AT LEAST
SOME avoidable suffering along his life. (4) Accepting avoidable suffering is
_never_ done for its own sake, and therefore it can generally be accounted as
being accepted for some other thing, a good that (will) more than offset the
evil suffered. This is not intrinsically different from doing (troublesome)
exercise to make the body (and soul) stronger - and there is little debate
about that kind of ""accepting suffering"".

It should be mentioned that the quote on the understanding to be given to the

document under Benedict XVI ('Doctrinal Note on some Aspects of
Evangelization'), is a footnote (49) from a text whose main body is entirely
devoted to the legitimacy of sharing one's faith.  
  
Even in ordinary language, the term 'proselytism' does have a vaguely negative
connotation these days, so it is fair enough that the Church has chosen to
deploy it to denote negative ways of promoting the faith, while giving this
clarifying definition in the 2007 document.  
  
The same magisterial document explains: ‘Everywhere and always, each Catholic
has the right and the duty to give the witness and the full proclamation of
his faith. With non-Catholic Christians, Catholics must enter into a
respectful dialogue of charity and truth, a dialogue which is not only an
exchange of ideas, but also of gifts, in order that the fullness of the means
of salvation can be offered to one’s partners in dialogue. In this way, they
are led to an ever deeper conversion to Christ…The work of ecumenism does not
remove the right or take away the responsibility of proclaiming in fullness
the Catholic faith to other Christians, who freely wish to receive it.’ (12)

Thing’ does seem to obliterate the immeasurable difference not only between
what He is and what all other things are but between the very mode of His
existence and theirs. I must at once restore the balance by insisting that
derivative things, from atoms to archangels, hardly attain to existence at all
in comparison with their Creator. Their principle of existence is not in
themselves. You can distinguish what they are from the fact that they are. The
definition of them can be understood and a clear idea of them formed without
even knowing whether they are. Existence is an ‘opaque’ addition to the idea
of them. But with God it is not so: if we fully understood what God is we
should see that there is no question whether He is. It would always have been
impossible that He should not exist. He is the opaque centre of all

(Quote)  
""But of course the (Jewish) doctrine of Creation leaves Nature full of
manifestations which show the presence of God, and created energies which
serve Him. The light is His garment, the thing we partially see Him through
(104:2), the thunder can be His voice (29:3–5). He dwells in the dark
thundercloud (18:11), the eruption of a volcano comes in answer to His touch
(104:32). The world is full of his emissaries and executors. He makes winds
His messengers and flames His servants (104:4), rides upon cherubim (18:10),
commands the army of angels.  
All this is of course in one way very close to Paganism. Thor and Zeus also
spoke in the thunder; Hermes or Iris was the messenger of the gods. But the
difference, though subtle, is momentous, between hearing in the thunder the
voice of God or the voice of a god. As we have seen, even in the creation-
myths, gods have beginnings. Most of them have fathers and mothers; often we
know their birthplaces. There is no question of self-existence or the
timeless. Being is imposed upon them, as upon us, by preceding causes. They
are, like us, creatures or products; though they are luckier than we in being
stronger, more beautiful, and exempt from death. They are, like us, actors in
the cosmic drama, not its authors. Plato fully understood this. His God
creates the gods and preserves them from death by His own power; they have no
inherent immortality. In other words, the difference between believing in God
and in many gods is not one of arithmetic. As someone has said ‘gods’ is not
really the plural of God; God has no plural. Thus, when you hear in the
thunder the voice of a god, you are stopping short, for the voice of a god is
not really a voice from beyond the world, from the uncreated. By taking the
god’s voice away—or envisaging the god as an angel, a servant of that
Other—you go further. The thunder becomes not less divine but more. By
emptying Nature of divinity—or, let us say, of divinities—you may fill her
with Deity, for she is now the bearer of messages.""

But the more I grew up, the more I saw how bullshit and make-believe that idea
was. That's why I was very (and still am in some way) very afraid to believe
or take something for granted. I don't want to believe in something because of
how it tastes (i.e good or desirable), but because that's the truth. That's
why I (wrongly as I can see now) take the road of ""naturalism"". Not only
because of the overwhelming appeal that has today but because it was ""science""

with it - and in fact, it seems more reasonable to ""believe"" in absurdities

"I'd like to discuss the Scholastic distinction between potency and act. It is
often alleged that without this distinction, it is impossible to make sense of
change. I'm not so sure about that.  
  
Surely we can account for change simply by positing different levels of
actuality. Thus an actual piece of gold (a substance) may acquire the higher-
level (accidental) actualizations of roundness and flatness, when hammered by
a goldsmith. There's no need for talk of mysterious potencies here - just
different levels of actuality.  
  
Consider also the fact that every potency, whether passive or active, is
grounded in some actuality. A boxer, for instance, has the passive power to be
bruised because his body is actually covered with flesh, and he has the active
power to hit and knock out his opponent because his body actually contains
bone and muscle, enabling him to punch hard.  
  
Readers might ask, ""What's the difference between the account you're proposing
and the Aristotelian account? And couldn't simply we define 'potency' as a
lower level of actuality?"" The practical difference between the two accounts
is that if every potency is grounded in some actuality, then the existence of
prime matter, or pure passive potency, becomes a metaphysical impossibility.
It's actuality all the way down, until we finally get to some ultimate
physical forms (quantum fields, perhaps?) underlying the everyday objects we
see.

"I love Dr. Feser cosmological arguments to God existence, but they have the
difficult of depending on metaphysical thesis that some non-theists would not
be willing to accept, one being that there is good and bad, these not being
relative. I even remember a guy who posted here who did believe in a First
Cause but not really in God. This made me think of this:  
  
Suppose that one believes in a First Cause that has something like a intellect
and a will, even being omniscient, but who also is a moral nihilist, so this
Cause is not considered divine.  
  
To this view to work, the Cause would need to choose to create this world, of
course, but how would this happens? To make a choice, one needs to intend
something, but if there are in reality no good or bad things them why would
the First Cause intend anything?  
  
It can't be because the Cause make the mistake of thinking that somethings are
good, for we are dealing with a omnipotent being.  
  
It can't be because the Cause has a tendency to choose this or that, for our
own tendencies are caused by our bodily constitution and by our intellect
limitations, both things the First Cause is free from.  
  
It seems to me them that if one is willing to accept a First Cause them either
there are better goals than others, so things are better or worser than others

feel a lot of shame and fear of people mocking me and not taking me seriously,

that that's how I feel and in some way, that's why I'm somehow tied to

ideology is true at the end of the day?"" But the fact is still I'm too stupid

wrong or its stands or falls without being affected ever by the outward
disciplines of science? Because it sounds like something we could know for

simplify) if they do not exist, he says:  
  
""Consider the water atom as an allegedly indivisible substance in which inhere
the qualities of color, shape, wetness and mass. Resistance to the notion that
these qualities may be thought of as its parts comes from the intuition that
qualities do not simply float freely in the air, that they must be tethered to
something that then explains their occurrence together with other qualities.
Bundle theorists are typically asked to provide the principle of qualitative
unity that would explain the co- occurrence of many qualities in the absence
of a substance in which they inhere. The Buddhist bundle theorist says this is
the wrong question to be asking. Instead we should ask why, in the absence of
empirical evidence for the existence of substances as distinct from their
properties, we nonetheless have the intuition that substances are required to
explain qualitative unity."" (pp. 59)  
  
To say that ""in the absence of empirical evidence"" is just to beg the
question. but he goes on to say:  
  
""By hypothesis, color, shape, wetness, and mass tropes are compresent at a
certain spatio- temporal location. This much both sides can agree on. Here is
a possible explanation of the fact that we commonly take these to all be
properties of a single thing, the water atom. When we wish to specify the
location of this mass trope, it is easier to indicate it by using the term
“water atom” than by indicating each of the three other tropes present at that
location. This makes the communication process more efficient. It also
relieves us of the burden of ascertaining just which other tropes are present
at that location, given that we know from past experience that mass tropes are
generally accompanied by other tropes in a certain range. “Water atom”
functions as a convenient designator for a certain bundle of tropes (TS 832–
34; TSP ad TS 581– 83). That they make up a bundle has as much to do with us
and our interests and cognitive limitations as it does with how things are in
the  
world. The world as it is anyway contributes the fact of their compresence.
The rest— their being unified by their joint inherence in a substance— is our
doing. The Buddhist doctrine of the two truths is their answer to the bundle
theorist’s problem of unification.""  
  
Basically, he uses their conventionalist position to ""explain"" how we construe
substances from things that are nothing but tropes.

My point doesn't depend on whether Aristotle had a doctrine of prime matter,
since the discussion was about Aristotelians, who historically do. But for the
Aristotelians historically, 'prime matter' was just the term for things to
which Aristotle certainly refers: the matter underlying elemental change
(e.g., 305a), that of which even substance is predicated (e.g., 1029a), that
which is the first in the order of material causes because of the
impossibility of an infinite regress (e.g., 994a-b). (The last of these is
what led people to talk of 'prime matter' at all.)",588

You wrote:  
  
""theism cannot explain the rules of logic either and cannot take them as
seperate entities because there are no entities that are truly seperate from
God.""  
  
As I pointed out above, theism is not pantheism, so you need to work on that
distinction between credible, reliable witnesses and non-credible witnesses in
order to have better discernment about who to listen to about what is or is
not ""Theism"". Now that we have cleared this up, we can address the final false
statement in your response (You squeezed in quite a few in that little post).  
  
You claimed that theism has no means of accounting for the rules of logic.
Well, you got that one wrong as well. Theism is the *only* means of accounting
for the rules of logic. Let's recap on where we have gotten so far. It is
clear, for reasons noted above, that the laws of logic exist. Anyone making an
argument presupposes this. It is also clear, for reasons noted above, that the
laws of logic are not material. Walter does not have them buried in his
basement (In fact if they were anywhere, it is clear from the foregoing that
they are not at Walter's house).  
  
So, we have laws that exist and are immaterial. Along with this, these laws do
not change from place to place or over time. They are eternal. They are not
contingent on change in the material world. Yet these laws, just like numbers,
have real implications in the material world.  
  
The principle of non-contradiction is not *merely* a principle of thought. It
also permeates material being. It is for this reason that no one has ever seen
a non-chair-chair or a square circle or a married bachelor. They are
impossible to conceptualize and they are impossible to be (or exist).  
  
So, if these principles effect being and yet seem also to be mind dependent,
how else do we account for them except by an eternal mind? Now Mr. Walter, if
you have read your Edward Feser, you should be having flashbacks at this point
because Dr. Feser makes precisely this argument with regard to numbers and
other abstract objects in Five Proofs. He aptly refers to it as the
Augustinian argument. Now we have cleared up the last of your string of
misunderstandings. In the future, perhaps you might pause and reflect on
whether or not it is cogent to try to convince us that your keyboard does not

You agree non-contradiction permeates material being. Material being includes
life and us. Our brains were formed in a material universe out of material

laws of logic) buried in his basement. He doesn't have to dig for it. It's
buried in his very being. Principles do not effect being; being effects
principles. You are confusing cause and effect.  
  
Even if I accepted your argument, it still does not follow that an eternal

the capability is what people are calling potentiality, regardless of what

Thus your real argument just seems to be a rejection of prime matter as being
identified with passive potentiality. Prime matter is a conclusion arising
from two lines of argument, (1) no infinite regress in material causes, and
(2) something must be the subject of change in substantial change. Both of
these arguments still go through on your account: there are first material
causes (your 'ultimate physical forms') which remain the same in substantial
change. You just are arguing that prime matter consists entirely of immaterial
forms (= actualities without material causes) that are eternal and unchanging

proselytism that uses bad means (and motives) to push people into the Church,
and not to throw stones at the kinder, gentler persuasion by which we justly
bring others to appreciate the true Church of Christ. But at the same time,
Francis used highly ambiguous phrasings to convey that, and - like he has ever
so many other times - he INTENDS to be ambiguous, that's is precisely his
operating method.  
  
In this case, for example, there is, in addition to the negative-connotation
word ""proselytism"" in the second sentence, the word ""convince"" in the first
sentence. There is no reason, outside of Francis's choice to put them next to
each other, to imagine that ""convincing someone of your faith"" amounts to
""proselytism"". Even if one might have (before this) thought he was
**strictly** avoiding the impermissible ""proselytism"" types of action, and
merely speaking so as to ""convince"" a listener of his faith, now he has to
second-guess whether even that is allowable. And so, Francis chose to cloud up
the matter.  
  
It would be silly to look at all the hundreds (at this point) of occasions in
which he has done this, and somehow imagine that they come out evenly divided
between a traditional and a progressive view of Christianity. They do nothing
of the sort: the confusion and obscurity sown is **very decidedly** in favor
of one angle, and that's the progressive view. He's never accidentally
confusing in a way that promotes traditional, standard Catholicism. So, it's
not accidental at all, it's intentional.  
  
(And by the way, in that video by Mike Lofton is FAR from being wholly
exculpatory: take, for example, this quote from a 2007 doc. by BXVI's curia:  
  
_The term proselytism originated in the context of Judaism, in which the term
proselyte referred to someone who, coming from the gentiles, had passed into
the Chosen People….More recently, however, the term has taken on a negative
connotation, to mean the promotion of a religion by ujsing means, and for
motives, contrary to the spirit of the Gospel that is, which do not safeguard
the freedom and dignity of the person. It is in this sense that the term
proselytism is understood in the context of the ecumenical movement: cf. The
Joint Working Group between the Catholic Church and the World Council of
Churches…”_  
  
Sure, the World Council of Churches take the term ""proselytism"" that way,
**precisely because many of them think evangelization is a sin**. And so the
push on the idea of ""proselytism"" = bad, and try to eliminate the meaning of
the term which was just fine until they came along. Trying to control the
language to win the debate. And shame on the Vatican for accepting their
improper constraint on the term. If you want to shame those who proselytize
wrongly, SAY that ""they proselytize wrongly"". Don't change the language just
because it makes you uncomfortable.)

Humans tricked into believing false things are tricked through their

"I've been reading through the complete works of C. S. Lewis for the past 7-8
months. (Reading through his works by genre). When I got to his non-fiction
""popular works"" (such as Mere Christianity, Miracles, etc.), I was surprised
that his descriptions of God sound similar to the Classical Theist
understanding of God. (At least in some cases). Below are a few quotes from
Lewis's books (possibly) showing this.  
  
For each quote, the name of the book (and chapter) comes first.  
  
In this first quote when Lewis uses the word ""Dualism"" he means ""Cosmic
Dualism"" (the belief in 2 equal opposite powers that control the universe, one
good and the other evil), not ""Substance Dualism"". In this article he's
responding to C. E. M. Joad, a British philosopher who was arguing in favor of
Cosmic Dualism. (Lewis wrote this essay while WWII was happening).  
  
(God in the Dock, Part 1, Chapter 1 ""Evil and God"")  
(Quote)  
""We are left then to choose between monotheism and dualism—between a single,
good, almighty source of being, and two equal, uncreated, antagonistic Powers,
one good and the other bad. Dr. Joad suggests that the latter view stands to
gain from the ‘new urgency’ of the fact of evil. But what new urgency? Evil
may seem more urgent to us than it did to the Victorian philosophers—favoured
members of the happiest class in the happiest country in the world at the
world’s happiest period. But it is no more urgent for us than for the great
majority of monotheists all down the ages. The classic expositions of the
doctrine that the world’s miseries are compatible with its creation and
guidance by a wholly good Being come from Boethius waiting in prison to be
beaten to death and from St Augustine meditating on the sack of Rome. The
present state of the world is normal; it was the last century that was the
abnormality.  
This drives us to ask why so many generations rejected Dualism. Not,
assuredly, because they were unfamiliar with suffering; and not because its
obvious prima facie plausibility escaped them. It is more likely that they saw
its two fatal difficulties, the one metaphysical, and the other moral.  
The metaphysical difficulty is this. The two Powers, the good and the evil, do
not explain each other. Neither Ormuzd nor Ahriman can claim to be the
Ultimate. More ultimate than either of them is the inexplicable fact of their
being there together. Neither of them chose this tête-à-tête. Each of them,
therefore, is conditioned—finds himself willy-nilly in a situation; and either
that situation itself, or some unknown force which produced that situation, is
the real Ultimate. Dualism has not yet reached the ground of being. You cannot
accept two conditioned and mutually independent beings as the self-grounded,
self-comprehending Absolute. On the level of picture-thinking this difficulty
is symbolised by our inability to think of Ormuzd and Ahriman without
smuggling in the idea of a common space in which they can be together and thus
confessing that we are not yet dealing with the source of the universe but
only with two members contained in it. Dualism is a truncated metaphysic.""

organisms are extra-material (""a branch of knowledge that deals with living
organisms and vital processes"").  
  
I don't know what you mean by 'extra-material' here, but if you're trying to

" _Even in ordinary language, the term 'proselytism' does have a vaguely
negative connotation these days, so it is fair enough that the Church has
chosen to deploy it to denote negative ways of promoting the faith, while
giving this clarifying definition in the 2007 document.  
_  
  
Fair enough. While giving the clarification. But then again: _Not_ fair enough
absent the needed clarification, and certainly not when the clarification is
being more or less actively undermined by other ambiguity.  
  
And for particulars: one specific example used, of preaching for the ""gospel
of prosperity"", I would argue is **not** a sound example. The pope argues that
their interpretation of the gospel is in error, and their manner of persuading
is unjust. As to the latter - maybe so, although I would want to see specifics
to see what, precisely, is unjust. As to their erroneous interpretation - that
is so, but (in many cases, though admittedly not in all) the preachers are
_sincere_ in their misguided grasp of the gospel. So their error on this is in
no way more damaging to the mere fact of their trying to persuade others, than
is that of mainline Protestant churches, who also are in error in their
interpretation of the gospels. The pope's singling out the mainline
Protestants as being ""OK"", and the gospel of prosperity preachers being mean
nasty ""proselytizers"" is - on this score - not consistent.  
  
The real problem with the BAD kind of proselytism is that it uses as
persuasive forces things that _should not_ be used so. It may use false
premises. Or false logic. Or appeal to emotional ""motives"" that are not
founded on reasonable bases. Or unreasonable threats of bad outcomes ""if you
don't convert"". But mainline Protestants have used these tools also: e.g. they
have used false premises in falsely characterizing the _Catholic_ teachings
from which they depart. (E.G. ""Catholics worship Mary"".)  
  
These kinds of tools are wrongly used in _Catholic_ hands, too, so it's not
the _true proposition_ on account of which they are employed that is the
problem with them, it is the manner in which they act on the hearer to cause
belief.  
  
Like with all the other times Francis has played funny games with the truth:
it's not that his words cannot be understood - with added clarifications -
that makes them fit well with Catholic teaching overall. It's that he
persistently chooses to present so many of them in obscuring, confusing,
problematic ways, and he rarely bothers to clarify later himself, leaving it
to other organs of the Vatican to suggest clarifications, while he goes on
blythely generating more confusing commentary. The issue with ""God intends a
plurality of religions"" stuff is a perfect example: he went beyond appropriate
bounds in a public document, his curia ""corrected"" the sense of the passage so
as to mitigate the problem, and then later he again in signing yet another
public document with the same sort of obscurantist language.  
  
Francis has publicly ""justified"" his so-called ""carelessness"" in these
confusing sayings / teachings, by _saying_ that he is careless. But from the
fact that the errors and obscurantism all plays to one angle, it isn't truly
an accidental kind of carelessness. And anyway, if a person knows he is
careless in off-the-cuff remarks, (a) that does not excuse him from _not
refraining_ from making such remarks where he could sow problems, and (b) it
does not excuse him with respect to written documents published after (what
should be) careful consideration. Francis can easily evade charges of heresy
by pointing to his carelessness. He cannot easily evade charges of

Hi! You offered a good description of these buddhists and pointed out some

argument of his i remember:  
  
if things last for a moment and them are gone would not this triple process of
start existing-acting-ceasing to be generate a infinite regress? The existing
action itself would have a start existing-acting- ceasing to be process and so
its three parts, and the start of this process would have one as well and...
you know that this does not ends, quite a good reading(but only read Nagarjuna
with commentaries!)

substances existence would be that he conceptualize substance as the indian
Atman: something unchanging, and did not accept that a substance and its
acidents could be diferent while the acidents depended on the substance(for
him, either you do not depend on the other thing at all, like a man and his
girlfriend, or there is just 1 and not 2 things). Aristotle was needed there.  
  
And my principal problem with any buddhist worth the name: how exactly things
change orderly if there is no substance ordering acidents? Why the color
acidents aways generate the visual perception and not a auditory one or pain?
Saying that things act on law-like patterns is just to describe things; there

"I've read Strauss's ""Natural Right and History"" at least four times, very
carefully. I think in a nutshell his ""natural right"" is basically ""right of
the strongest"" -- but as a hidden puppet master. It's sure not ""right of the
individual.""",239
"George LeSauvage,  
  
Nowhere in ""Natural Right and History"" does Strauss make an argument for ""a
body of unchanging moral principles regarded as a basis for all human
conduct."" We should dismiss the idea that the book is about what we would
consider natural law. Nowhere does Strauss make an argument for individual
rights generally, or any individual right specifically as we would understand
those rights as listed the US Bill of Rights or our Declaration of
Independence. He doesn't even argue that such a right exists in the most
abstract sense. Even when Strauss mentions a document in what appears to be a
favorable light, be careful to scrutinize what he really says about it. It's
probably not what one thinks on first reading.  
  
Strauss writes as he asks his students to read -- esoterically as well as
exoterically. One must be very careful when one reads Strauss because he
writes to intentionally pander to those who want to interpret his words in a
superficial context. He does not want the unwashed masses to know what he
really believes.  
  
The question was about the meaning of ""natural right"" as used by Straussians
-- how can it be more basic than natural law. The answer is very simple. A
Straussian who really understands Strauss would deny natural law is a real
thing. It's a myth created to achieve an end. And it's ""right"" that someone in
the ""know"" should do that.

But at the same time, there is a problem with me I couldn't help but think
that what if I got them all wrong? What if their arguments are plausible at
all? I'm not a philosopher, just a normal guy. And I want to confess
something: even though I do not think that something like that (buddhism) is
plausible at all, I am afraid of the possibility that it could be because I am
ignorant and my OCD does not let me go through this. It was a lot hard to
write all these comments - since I am struggling with myself to even conclude
a thought. There were a lot more - and a lot more detailed criticism - that I
want to write but I simply can't (especially a topic at 4.5 that's the most
important part of all it but I don't have the necessary strength and a point
that I tried to make à-la Aristotelian retortion in the sense that they must
presuppose permanence and can't get rid of it in making their arguments in the
same way that Alex Rosenberg can't get rid of intentionality when trying to
'naturalize intentionality').  
  
And for those of you who think: ""why buddhism bothers you that much?"" The
answer should be self-evident by now (and for reasons that make simple
materialism looks like a weekend at the beach): look at the consequences of
all that. There would be no persons, no things, and in some way just
suffering. Life would be just horrible. There would be illusions all around
us. All persons would be substances per accident - and that's just awful and I
can't believe that there are people who find this idea pleasing. And the other
reason is OCD. Looks like nothing that I could present by myself is ever
sufficient to disprove them. Looks like my arguments are never enough - and
since I'm just illiterate in philosophy there is a wall I could never cross.  
  
Unfortunately, I came across buddhism by chance when I was fixated on the
experiment of Benjamin Libet on free will (at least his sense of ""free will"")
and stumbled across the work of Sam Harris arguing that since there was no
free will there is the illusion of the self. Since I have OCD things don't 'go
out' of my head that easily (like in the case of normal people). Since the
idea per se is insane I tried to understand why people think that it's
plausible in the first place. And by their paradoxical 'reductio' way of
arguing and the abuse of science that they always propose (bearing in mind
that I didn't know that there is such a thing as A-T Meta at the time) that
stuck in my head and only got worse through the years.  
  
So, I appreciate it if someone could help me with it. Even though it's not
apparent, I tried to put a lot of effort into solving it. But I simply can't

"Dear @Talmid and @Michael Copas  
  
I don't even know how to start this without sounding strange (to say the
least) but based on what I was saying in the latter post about my OCD and
depression, and the friendly incentive from Michael to talk about this in some
way... so I am here trying to expose the arguments that I try to make my OCD
go away with this topic off buddhism.  
  
To understand the buddhist position I make an extreme amount of effort (due to
how I felt every time I came in contact with it and due to the fact that I'm
just a normal guy) and based myself on some works but most specifically: Jay
L. Garfield ""engaging buddhism: why it matters to philosophy"" and Mark
Siderits ""how things are: an introduction to buddhist metaphysics""  
  
Things to notice about buddhism, in general, is the thesis that they subscribe
to mereological nihilism, momentariness (nothing exists more than an instant),
nominalism (or conceptualism depending on the 'school'), and what they call
""anti-substancehood"".  
  
If someone is a philosopher (a true philosopher, not a continental one) I do
recommend reading the Mark Siderits one since it is a defense of buddhist
metaphysics positions in all its aspects (the book cover even says that it is
''buddhist philosophy for philosophers"", so let's commit the fallacy of
authority here). So a literate philosopher (not some random guy like me) could
see the full picture i.e how far can the arguments go in a necessary way and
if they were to be coherent at all at the end of the day. Btw, Ed, I hope that
you're reading this.  
  
So, the major differences between their position and ours are that:  
  
1 - they collapse the distinction of act and potency (e.g for something to
exist is for it to ""keep producing"" its effects in some way continuously, they
use the example of a sprout saying that if the sprout is permanent and not
momentary it should keep producing its effect continuously).  
  
2 - they take universals to be ""abstract"" and ""causally ineffective"". Their
idea of causality resembles a lot a proto-humean one (like its some kind of
idea of the mind conjoining things together).  
  
3 - they do not even address the Aristotelian sense of substance at all and
collapse its position with bare substrata. Since this is a ""serious charge"" I
will quote a footnote from the Siderits book: ""I am here using “substance” in
the Lockean sense of the “something know not what” that underlies and supports
an object’s properties. This usage is common to both Aristotle and Nyāya.""
(footnote 16, page 65 of the book I've mentioned above).

"At some point the ""taken out of context"" explanation becomes the abolition of

The converse is true with the writings of those who haven't the slightest grip
on reality (including Buddhists). One of Kant's friends had to stop reading
his work because he felt he was going crazy. If the philosophy makes a person
less sane, this is a good cue that it is neither good nor true. I hope to say

"Someone explain ""measure"" to me in Aquinas. Like I'm five. Well maybe 25. This
section of De Veritate for example:  
  
Note, however, that a thing is referred differently to the practical intellect
than it is to the speculative intellect. Since the practical intellect causes
things, it is a measure of what it causes. But, since the speculative
intellect is receptive in regard to things, it is, in a certain sense, moved
by things and consequently measured by them. It is clear, therefore, that, as
is said in the Metaphysics, natural things from which our intellect gets its
scientific knowledge measure our intellect. Yet these things are themselves
measured by the divine intellect, in which are all created things—just as all
works of art find their origin in the intellect of an artist. The divine
intellect, therefore, measures and is not measured; a natural thing both
measures and is measured; but our intellect is measured, and measures only
artifacts, not natural things.  
  
Is a measure, measures, is measured...what is happening? I think ""measure"" and
I picture someone with a ruler walking up to a sofa or whatever and thinking:
I wonder if that will fit in my living room. Hm. I will measure it and then we
will see. That's it. But Aquinas is taking some basic meaning of this word and
extending it to a host of other things, and I can't quite grasp what that is.
""Measure"" turns up in a lot of his writing, and whenever it does, I just
think: Oh no, not that again. There's a lock on that term in my head and I
can't find the key.",1550
"This is a new idea that I had not heard of. And I admit that there's room for
more understanding, but I would hazard this:  
  
By ""living uterus donation"" do you mean Jane, who is healthy, giving over her
uterus to Sally, whose uterus is damaged and cannot be healed, so that Sally
can conceive a and bear a child?  
  
If we assume that Jane is not offering her uterus _in order to avoid
conceiving_ , the contraceptive aspect of the perverted faculty argument is
not applicable. If, for example, Jane is single and expects to stay that way,
and stably has not been engaging in sexual relations, she can be presumed not
to enter into this for contraceptive reasons. She is not perverting her
faculty of reproduction.  
  
Nor is Sally perverting her faculty of reproduction: her faculty is being
impeded by a damaged organ, which (apparently) can be worked around by medical
means. So far as ""faculty"" arguments go, this is morally licit.  
  
The real weight of the moral difficulty is in Jane effectively maiming
herself: it is not _generally_ reasonable to take away a functioning major
body part. However, the ""generally"" I added there does imply reservations on
how far that applies: it is (by most ethicists) considered moral for a person
to donate one of his 2 kidneys to another whose kidneys have failed. This is
even laudable: the donor can (for the most part) ""get by"" on one kidney -
though they will live a life of increased risk, because they no longer have a
""back-up"" kidney to take over if one is not functioning.  
  
Arguably, Jane can use the same approach to justify donating her uterus to a
woman whose own uterus is damaged: if Jane isn't going to ""use it"", she can
offer its use to another. However, I see potential quagmires here, and I don't
think it's that simple. On the one hand, if Jane is single, on what basis is
she _certain_ she will not marry? If she is married, on what basis is she able
to definitively decide she won't be ""needing"" that uterus any more? (On the
other hand, what if Jane has taken permanent vows of celibacy in a monastic
order, and knows she will not be using her reproductive faculties for
reproduction?)  
  
Secondly, the reproductive organs are highly inter-related, and it is
absolutely _not_ a given that ""because Jane won't be using the organs for
reproduction"" doesn't altogether imply the organs have no health function in
the body. This is manifestly true of the ovaries, and hormonal activity that
regulates tons of other body functions than JUST reproduction. I don't have
any knowledge of whether the uterus, like the ovaries, is involved in other
activities for health. I suspect that (a) the medical system claims those
health risks are minimal, and (b) that they _may_ be oversimplifying the case
in saying so, but I don't actually know.  
  
As to being involved in ""the system"": since there seems (to me, indicated
above) that there is a plausible argument that the underlying donative action
is morally licit _in some cases_ , it comes down to a prudential judgment
whether the overall activity is _nearly always_ a donation precisely because
Jane wants to avoid the possibility of pregnancy, i.e. whether working for it
is supporting something that almost always is being done immorally, or not. If
it is nearly always being done immorally with a contraceptive intent, it might
be imprudent to _support_ the medical practice by aiding the research. If
_not_ , i.e. if there seem to be plenty of cases (even if still in the
minority) that are not donations for contraceptive intentions, then I think
you can use a _general presumption_ of moral licitness of the individual
cases, and this would seem to permit being involved in ""the system"" of medical
support / research in the activity. But that's just my opinion.",3791
"""It's that there is no good reason to believe something exists for which there
is no evidence.""  
  
Well, now Mr. Jindra, why don't you tell us what counts as evidence and how
you arrived at the conclusion that your proposal is true. What I suspect you
mean by evidence is ""empircally verifiable"". In other words, it has to be
something that you can see to count as evidence. Or put in the terms of the
debate it has to be material to count as evidence. So for someone to show you
that the immaterial exists, you need them to show it to you in material form.
Well that makes about as much sense as you standing behind the podium doing
the macarena, now doesn't it.  
  
In philosophy 101 and basic logic, students learn that this is called ""begging
the question"". You are assuming the very thing that needs to be proven and you
are requiring that this assumption also be taken by others as the only means
to show you that it is not true. Oh what a wicked web we weave.  
  
So the assertion that ""knowledge requires empirical verification"" is itself
*not verifiable by its own criteria*. Those insisting upon it are either
unreflective or like to impose heavy burdens on the backs of others that they
themselves don't have to carry. Reminds me of some folks in the Gospels that

paths to God"", with one of these being science, which Gensler argues is

"I would add: if one is growing, and the other is not, **that very growth**
should imply you exercise patience and understanding toward the one lagging
behind. If you have been given a gift more than another person, do not cast
off the other as unworthy: it was a GIFT to you, not your own merit that
brought it. Why, therefore, would you despise the person who has not received
the gift, in which state _you would still be if you had not been granted the
gift?_  
  
And further: by patiently asking God that He also shower your spouse with
comparable gifts of growth, mayhap you will merit God granting such growth.
So: your observing a lack in your spouse is _reason to do something to help
your spouse (by prayer and sacrifice),_ not reason to leave.  
  
And further: do not let pride deceive you: if you see that you have grown in
_one_ way (where your spouse has not), never forget that perhaps your spouse
has grown in 3 or 4 ways less visible, where you have not. There are a
thousand different avenues of growth, not one or two. God works at a different
pace in each area, for each person. And not all growth is manifest to either
the person growing or to those around.  
  
Never imagine that ""incompatibility"" due to one person growing and the other
not constitutes a basis for believing the marriage is ""void"". God's will for
marriage is that it persist through life, even in difficult times, even in the
difficulties of difficult personality clashes. Growth, alone, is not
incompatibility, and even if there were some incompatibility - even if (in
spite of charitable efforts) one spouse becomes _impossible_ to live with,
(say, you became a Catholic and your spouse simply could not stand that) and a
legal separation is necessary, that **does not void or break** the marriage,
it merely means that you should live apart from your spouse for some time. He
or she remains your spouse, until death, just a spouse separated from you.

properties. If you scrap matter for just another kind of form then you have a

When I was in high school, sex ed class did not teach me that the brain is a
sexually dimorphic organ. I had to learn this on my own. The brains of fœtuses
develop according to the gender of the baby unless something disrupts this.  
  
Logically speaking, when nothing disrupts the development of the brain, it is
impossible to desire to be the opposite gender.  
  
The reason we know that gender dysphoria is not due to intellectual confusion
is because animals exhibit gender confusion due to the influence of
environmental contaminants on the sexual differentiation of the brain. Why are
humans beyond that?",634

That was incredible, you are amazing guys. Thank you so much for the in-depth
answers. That helped a lot.  
  
I asked that because of the time I've been passing through life in the last 3
years. My life has been a lot miserably. So it's nice to know that - even
though it's hard to imagine how in one act - God is listening to my prayers.
But I won't lose my faith.  
  
In case you guys were curious about that it has to do with things that
happened before I meet Ed's blog. My life - my family - life has always been
pretty harsh. And to worsen all that I have OCD. My grandmother on my father-
side died of Alzheimer and I'm afraid that my father would develop that too.
My mother lost her job due to an injustice that happened to her during the
pandemic and all that bullshit.  
  
But the worst thing that doesn't seem to go away is the depression and trauma
that my OCD contributed to. I was very very influenced by Libet's
''experiment'' back then and unfortunately, I acknowledge a fella named Sam
Harris with all that mysticism about 'no self' etc. (that seemed to follow
from the experiment's conclusion), and since then that stuck in my head - not
because I believed it - even though I had a weak spot for materialism and
'took it for granted' because you know ''science'' mentality that I was
influenced to. The problem was (somehow still) the fact that I didn't even
know how to defend myself from all that (i.e that the experiment methods were
bogus, that the rest doesn't necessarily follow from it). And the implication
with all of that in my life was the fact that if that is true, life is simply
worse than it seems. There is just pain and suffering. What weighed more than
one hundred pounds for me was the fact that I simply love my mom and my family
and if there was no free will, no God, and we were somehow unreal because
there was no self (nothing that lasts or abides)... I don't need to paint the
rest of the picture to see how evil, atrocious, and how I felt and still feel
because I have nightmares and traumas with that till nowadays.  
  
In the midway path between that, I found Ed's blog and began to read it - even
emailed him one time. And that gave me hope that there was a God after all and
that those things could be false.  
  
But even so, buddhist claims from Harris traumatized me a lot and due to my
OCD, I still suffer from them till today. Deep there, I confess I'm really
afraid that something evil like that is possibly true. Because it's an even
worse version of materialism with all its adorns.

authors from that and engaged against it for some time (authors like Jay
Garfield and Mark Siderits)

"According to his recent book Tradition and Apocalypse, Hart believes that the
only people who can truly be judged as heretics are ""in cases of moral
departure from the explicit teachings of Christ"", which would only include
supporters of capital punishment, right-wing Catholic integralists,
libertarians, and Trump supporters. ""Beyond these obvious examples,"" Hart
argues. ""judgement is best withheld.""  
  
In other words, anyone who ventures far from what Hart takes to be Jesus'
moral mission (and keep in mind, Hart believes Jesus to have been an anarcho-
communist agitator) can be an obvious heretic. For everyone else, it's all up
in the air. The criteria for Christian theological orthodoxy in Hart's eyes
appears to be left-wing political orthodoxy.",759
"The reason there is such a category as “heresy” in Christianity, whereas there
is no such category in purely philosophical systems, is that Christianity
claims to be grounded in special divine revelation. Anything that purports to
be a Christian position must be consistent with that revelation, and the
notion of heresy is the notion of that which is not consistent with it. Now, a
Christian theologian who is accused of heresy might, of course, reasonably
question whether the charge is just. He can try to show that his position is,
when correctly understood, compatible with Christian revelation. But what he
_cannot_ reasonably do is dismiss considerations of orthodoxy and heresy _tout
court_. Again, by virtue of calling himself a Christian, he is committed to
staying within the bounds of the revelation, and thus avoiding heresy. And
thus he is committed to acknowledging that to accuse a fellow Christian of
heresy _is indeed an argument_. It may or may not at the end of the day be a
_good_ argument, but it is an argument.",1034
"@the most recently posting anonymous.  
  
I am not sure what you are talking about in stating that there are no
Scriptures that teach that people are in hell. Did you not read all of what I
wrote above? Christ says, ""few will find it"" (the narrow road that leads to
heaven). So would you have us believe that those making no effort to find and
follow the narrow path, will ultimately land themselves precisely on that path
without the slightest effort? So, Christ will save them without their willing
to be saved? Well, that is contrary to Catholic teaching as Trent taught
definitively that we must cooperate with God's grace.  
  
This includes following the warning of Christ to ""make every effort to enter
through the narrow gate"". Your reading would require that this should be
interpreted: ""You don't really need to make any effort at all because everyone
will (or might) get into heave without being on the path or without trying.""
Well, as I said above, that is not an ""interpretation"" it is a rejection of
our Lord's words.  
  
So, yes, we do have revelation that has made clear that ""few will find it""
(the path to salvation). Again, if you think that they will arrive at their
destination by some path other than the narrow path that Christ names, where
on earth did you get such wisdom to know more than our Lord how we get to
Heaven? Perhaps you have been there and can guide us in this new path that you
have in mind. Please tell us about it. Is it broad and easy? That sounds alot
nicer than the narrow path. Please tell us more. Does it just include doing
whatever we want and then we arrive at heaven? Again, do tell.",1636

never took it too serious).  
  
You have very dificult problems, but i feel like i can give a feel tips. First
of all: don't be afraid of looking for help. After that:  
  
1\. Do a Kant: You have this dificult of fearing that these things might be
true. Well, besides theoretical reason there is pratical reason, one can't
ignore the pratical implications of a belief when seeing if it is true.  
  
It is not obvious to you that there is a nobler way to live? That there is in
us the possibility of finding meaning on suffering? That you should care about
others? Well, materialism can't be true if these are, and even most
materialists would admit they can't prove materialism, so...

"Am I missing something or does this text (as well as Fr. Rooney) commit a
basic mistake in logic? Hart's necessitarianism is not a necessary condition
for 1.  
  
""1. that God could not do otherwise than cause human beings to love him""  
  
Even assuming universalism requires 1, the ""could not do otherwise"" clause is
a conditional one. That is to say, *if* God creates humans, God cannot do
otherwise than cause human beings to love him. This is consistent with there
being a possible world in which God does NOT create anything, or creates a
universe with no human beings in it. It is only inconsistent with God creating
a world with humans and then having said humans not love him/be damned in the
end. From the impossibility of people being lost forever, universalists are
not arguing that it's impossible that people never have existed in the first
place. It should be obvious that it is a conditional on the creation of people
- to put it differently, from infernalism and annihilationism being impossible
it does not follow that universalism is necessary simpliciter, such that God
could not have chosen to not make a universe with humans being all saved.  
  
For whatever merits necessitarianism might or might not have, it is obviously
not a necessary condition for strong universalism.",1297
"Okay now to address your scenario. You are asking whether the scenario you
describe is possible. Here we have to make a distinction between something
being logically possible and something that is actually the case. The scenario
you describe is logically possible in the same way that it is logically
possible that God could have made unicorns. However, framing it this way and
then going on to say that we should hope for this is analagous to suggesting
that we should hope for the existence of unicorns.  
  
The question is not whether it is logically possible in the strict sense. The
question is: what from reason or revelation has led you to think that this is
in fact the case? After we have all listened to the crickets for a bit, we
should be able to move on from this question. Instead we have to put up with
folks bending their will to find any figure within the tradition who will
agree with their foregone conclusions.  
  
Their approach is not: what is the weight of Tradition on this question. Their
question is: can I find anyone who agrees with me. Their question is not: how
do I operate within the stream of Tradition making sense of all of Scripture
in light of Tradition and especially in light of the greatest figures in the
Tradition (doctors like St. Thomas, St. Augustine, etc.). Rather their
approach is: how close can I get to affirming something as close to
universalism as possible without actually committing myself to propositions
that have been explicitly condemned. This is *NOT* a catholic approach to
theology.  
  
The problem, however, is even greater than what I have described. It is not
that they have neither reason nor revelation supporting their position and
they choose to believe it anyways. That would be irrational. However something
more is occurring. They actually have both Scripture affirming that few will
find eternal life and the greatest doctors of the Church understanding that
passage in its very obvious sense and they reject this testimony or explain it
away. Again, that is *not* a Catholic approach to theology.  
  
And contrary to the calumnious suggestions otherwise, the concern of those who
are speaking out against these trends is ""pastoral"". Those speaking against
these trends (e.g. Ralph Martin in his book Will Many Be Saved? and Edward
Feser and Fr. Rooney and the Popes who have repeatedly warned about
indifferentism) are motivated precisely out of love for those drawn into
indifference over sin because of these dangerous opinions. Hard to get people
to suffer the embarrassment of a good confession if they think that everyone
is going to heaven regardless. And those who say ""well it is possible that
everyone is going to heaven"" easily move to: most people are in fact going to
heaven for otherwise God would be cruel. I have heard *precisely this
argument* from a prominent adherent of VB and the comment was quickly deleted
after it was posted. The fact that adherents of VB are moving in the direction
of thinking that they know that most people are going to heaven should give
pause to disciples of VB and to those who fawn over sophistry from the pen of
DBH.",3143
"Bradshaw argues that even Dionysius the Areopagite can, contrary to what is
often thought, be interpreted as holding that God could have refrained from
creating (though the exegetical issues are complicated and I leave it to the
interested reader to look at Bradshaw’s paper for himself). Bradshaw thus
judges there to be an “apparent unanimity of [patristic] tradition regarding
divine choice.”",395
"_Both of these options, however, entail heresy. This is why universalism has
been seen as heretical by mainstream Christianity for millennia, for good

"It's strange how Western converts to the Orthodox Church so often seem to take
up its least orthodox strands. Is it all about boredom with sana doctrina?
There are pious Orthodox monks who spout theories like everything going to
heaven, the devil too. But then, that religion has had no mechanism for
establishing what Revelation is since slamming the door a thousand years
ago,so such views go on without too much disturbance. Even so, the average
cradle follower of Orthodoxy seems little interested in most of the stranger
theories - as long as he doesn't start getting ""ideas"".  
  
By the way, it's hard to see why Christianity's grounds should be termed
revelation of a special kind. Are there there any decisive grounds for this
religion apart from those beyond the capabilities of human nature? The
revelation that makes Christianity possible is supernatural of itself, with no
confusion with what men can to discover through their own potential, which is
why the term is universally used without qualification, and perfectly
understood and accepted. The addition ""special"" in connection with the
revelation of the faith seems superfluous, and reduces clarity.",1168
"Then there is this passage from Athanasius’s _Four Discourses against the
Arians_ , [III.61](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/28163.htm), which
contrasts God the Son with the things He creates:",194
"I agree that these two positions are distinct and should be kept apart for the
purpose of recognizing whether either one is contrary to _what the Church
teaches_. Von Balthasar's position is much less easy to attack as contrary, or
as clearly and explicitly contrary.  
  
But whether salvation for all it is something that we can ""reasonably"" hope
for is not the same as whether it is clearly and explicitly contrary to what
the Church teaches. Some teachings make it imprudent, unwise, or temerarious
(rash) to propose, without being definitely opposed to Church teaching,
because the Church teaching strongly **leans** in a certain direction without
(yet) being _definitive_ about it. For example, the Holy Office stated over
100 years ago that it MAY NOT safely be taught that Christ in his human
intellect did not have the knowledge of those in Beatitude during his period
on Earth, nor even that the position be held as debatable or uncertain.  
  
In addition to the (many) biblical passages that _at least point toward_ the
result that some are damned, there are some passages whose import are (and
have been taken traditionally as saying) that some are _in fact_ damned,
rather than that some may be damned. And whether they have been
""traditionally"" taught so, versus ""Traditionally"" taught so, i.e. whether the
weight of the apostolic and Fathers teachings' comes down definitively on one
side of that, I hesitate to say, but then again perhaps _so should everyone
else_. It may be **rash** to say (and teach) that all may be saved is a
reasonable hope.  
  
Nevertheless, one may certainly PRAY for all, in the sense of (a) having good
will toward all; and (b) asking God to offer his favor to all; so that (c) all
who _might be saved_ will indeed be saved. While your benevolence applies to
all in that **any one** might be saved, and thus of any one you hope he be
saved, it need not encompass an active hope that _every_ single one be saved.
This benevolence (and it's consequent form of prayer) is an appropriate
expression of charity, being clearly assimilable to God's _antecedent_ will
that all be saved.",2123

"Though Hart couldn’t care less about Catholic doctrine on this subject, it is
worth noting that the Church has formally defined this teaching. The First
Vatican Council [declares](https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/first-

free from all necessity, but as necessarily as he necessarily loves himself…
let him be anathema.” Fr. Rooney calls attention to this and other relevant
magisterial statements.",481
"As I have complained in [a recent exchange with
Hart](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2022/04/whose-pantheism-which-dualism-

consistent on this point. When it suits his interests, he will appeal to
orthodox Christian tradition, and claim that his own views are more consistent
with it than those of his opponents. But in other cases, he will dismiss the
standard criteria of Christian orthodoxy and appeal instead to merits that his
views purportedly exhibit independently of questions of orthodoxy. As I there
argued, Hart’s approach isn’t, at the end of the day, that of a Christian
theologian. Rather, it is that of a theologian who happens to have been
influenced by Christian tradition, but whose ultimate criteria are to be found
elsewhere. The considerations raised by Fr. Rooney, and Hart’s failure to take
them seriously, reinforce that conclusion.",933

layman's perspective here. I enjoy both your and DBH's writings. I learn from
your perspectives. With that said, I can't help but think you and Fr. Rooney
(I did read his article) are being a bit obtuse here. Hart does not seem to be
arguing that there is some power outside of God which compels God, removing
God's free will, to create. Rather, his argument is that God's very *nature*
is such that creation naturally follows from just who God is - it is the
natural end result of God *being*. He who is Love, Good, etc. is, by virtue of
who he is, going to create. It seems as though you and Fr. Rooney are not
arguing against Hart's actual argument.",726
"As I said: if Rooney's essay was so useless as to be beneath him, then DBH
should have _left it_ as beneath him, including beneath comment. Saying (3 or
4 times) ""you're stupid"" is childish bullying, even if you do it in fancier
language.  
  
The book was about more than JUST the issue of permanent punishment in hell,
and DBH could have (for example) said things like ""pages 112-116 demolish
Rooney's argument X"", or whatever.  
  
_Rooney's article offers nothing new, other than the claim that Hart's
position amounts to ""heresy,"" and where has that accusation ever got anyone?_  
  
Well, no, it DOES offer more than shouting ""heresy"". It offers support for
that assertion from Eastern Fathers and saints, i.e. people that most Orthodox
Christians consider to _matter_ in identifying orthodoxy.  
  
_Hart obviously thinks its more important to be right than to be orthodox._  
  
I dare say you may be right, this is exactly how he thinks of it. And that,
ITSELF, constitutes a non-Christian way of thinking about it: due to Christ's
promises of protection, a Christian ought to be _very_ worried when he
discovers ""I think X"" but ""the orthodox view is not-X"", and ought to hold that
finding the above implies that very likely that he was wrong to think X is
true, because ""orthodoxy"" has protections in getting at truth that I don't
have. Preferring ""what-I-think-is-truth that I arrived at against orthodoxy""
over ""what-orthodoxy-says-is-truth"" is not **merely** ""preferring truth over
orthodoxy"". It constitutes also a position about ""my reliability in getting at
truth"" compared to ""the Church's reliability in getting at truth"". DBH can
hold his view of preferring truth to orthodoxy, and hold to NOT being bothered
about such a condition, but then he ought to _accept_ the comment of others
that this disqualifies him from being a Christian, instead of going off on
multi-page diatribes against them (as he has against Feser on that).",1947

Right off the bat Fr. Rooney’s summary is just awful. Hart has never argued
that it’s impossible to hell. He clearly affirms in various interviews
following the publication of TASBS that it’s possible, indeed likely, that
many will go to hell but that they will not remain there eternally. His view
makes the fires of hell purgative rather than retributive. Catholic thinkers
have to be able to take Hart’s arguments on their own terms rather than trying
to square them with foreign pictures of judgement (such as: immediate judgment
upon death whereupon one is sent to everlasting joy in heaven or everlasting
pain in hell). At this point it’s just sad how many putatively intelligent
Catholics cannot even summarize, let alone respond to Hart’s arguments. Even

This was my question, also. Given your response, I have to ask the following:
How does the *real* possibility of God opting not to create make any sense
given classical theism's core doctrines of divine immutability and simplicity?
It seems these most fundamental commitments logically entail the necessity—in
some sense—of creation.  
  
How exactly do you imagine a simple and unchanging God deciding between
creating or not creating? Did God flip a coin? Was God conflicted and then
experienced change such that the conflict was resolved? Did the possibility of
creation randomly occur in the mind of God, such that it might not have
occurred?",662

heresy and leave it at that. Rather, calmly and at length, he explains why
Hart’s position is heretical in the sense of being incompatible with other

Based on what I've learned from Ed I've tried to fight against that fear of
that undesired metaphysics. But my OCD won't let me. The more I've tried to
fight and understand things the more they stuck in my head. I could notice btw
a lot of gaps and things that I think were wrong with that nefast metaphysics
- but I'm incapable to fight on my own and understanding things (you know,
philosophy is hard. The fear of misinterpreting them due to a possible fallacy
by my part or that they got some ""magic argument"" that I don't know and could
just flip my refutation, etc. ).  
  
I tried to engage against those arguments from impermanence, they're ontology
and etc. by applying the methods of retorsion that Ed taught in the first
chapter of Scholastic's Meta. There are a lot of similarities or so I think
between Heraclitus and the Buddhists - after all, they both can't live for
more than a second. But due to all my trauma and the fact that I felt so
uncomfortable just by reading and thinking about it (my symptoms goes from
headache, sleepiness, and weakness to fever). And all the other things like
""what if they have some argument that I don't know that could prove that I'm
wrong'', ""what if I'm reading them wrong"" (even though I thought I'm somehow
not), ""what if they have some way to turn around that argument from Aristotle
in some way"" and all that stuff. But by now the more I try to confront this
I'm simply mentally incapable and it's been almost 3 years of living that way.
I don't have much more forces. My only hope is that someday some professional
philosopher as formidable, careful, and badass as Ed could discuss this thing
pointing out not just how it's wrong but that it can't even be right, to begin
with, so I can finally put all that pain to rest. Because I'm simply incapable
to tackle it by myself.

countryman @Talmid. Because just knowing that God can hear my prayers - that I
believe there IS a God - gives me hope that someday I may overcome all of this

Tradition. The answer to this question is an obvious ""no"" which is why you
framed it so imprecisely so that you could, through slight of hand, give the
appearance that somehow JPII and BVI are in your little old corner. Now that
we have cleared up that your corner is quite a bit more lonely than you would
like for the world to think, let's move on to your next inane assertion.  
  
The suggestion that not holding VB's position is to miss the entire point of
Christianity shows a lack of reflection on what you write before you actually
place your fingers on the keyboard. You are condemning nearly every saint and
doctor of the Church who has spoken on this matter as ""missing the point of
Christianity"" for not holding the idiosyncratic position of a theologian of
the 20th century. This 20th century theologian was influenced by both Barth
and by an odd (to say the least) relationship with Adrienne von Speyr on the
very point we are discussing. It is clear that you are not familiar with these
issues, but that should make you more circumspect before condemning the
greatest saints and doctors of the Church because they are not disciples of
VB. I will address some of the other silly things that you posted when I have
a bit more time.

" _One can't instead appeal to some ""mere orthodoxy"" common to all Christians
across confessional boundaries, at least not without stretching that ""mere"" to
meaninglessness._  
  
Orthodox Christians, (as well as Catholics), usually place great reliance on
the teachings of the Fathers, especially they revere the early Fathers and the
Greek Fathers, and they rely on the early Councils. A plausible case of
departure from _orthodoxy_ on that basis can be made - by Catholics - against
someone who (at least used to) comport himself as an Orthodox Christian.
Rooney cites (a) an essay on the Eastern Patristic tradition on God's freedom,
and eastern saints John Damascene, and Isaac of Nineveh. Maybe his argument
isn't a great one - I have reservations about a couple points, myself - but
it's not **irrelevant** to the orthodoxy of an Orthodox Christian.",855

"Revelation, properly speaking, is supernatural. Christianity is this
Revelation essentially.  
  
Revelation is not a conversation; it is God speaking to mankind. If what
humans are able to establish by reasoning were God speaking, human personhood
and autonomous thought would be doubtful as, eventually, would divinity. Our
religion is the result of supernatural revelation - it's evident from the
first book of the OT.",421
"Hart ""cannot be bothered to even point in the direction of an actual
argument?"" He wrote a whole book about it, and has written numerous articles
responding to criticisms of his position. Rooney's article offers nothing new,
other than the claim that Hart's position amounts to ""heresy,"" and where has
that accusation ever got anyone? Hart can simply reply ""Fine, I am a heretic,
but I'm still right, so why should I care?"" Hart obviously thinks its more
important to be right than to be orthodox. That may (as Dr. Feser argues) make
him some kind of fake Christian, but it has no bearing whatsoever on whether
he's right or wrong.",631
"The Fathers also understand divine freedom in a way that rules out God’s being
necessitated to do what he does. As David Bradshaw
[notes](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/divine-freedom-in-greek-
fathers.pdf), Clement of Alexandria says that “God does not do good by
necessity, but by choice.” (Does this conflict with the Christian doctrine
that God cannot positively will evil? No, because we can understand Clement as
meaning, not that God could do evil instead of good, but rather that he could
refrain from acting at all rather than doing some good action.) Bradshaw also
notes that Basil the Great rejects the idea that God creates “without choice,
as the body is the cause of shadow and light the cause of brightness” (where
he obviously takes these effects of the body and of light to be necessitated
by them); and that Gregory of Nyssa holds that God created “ _not by any
necessity_ … but because it was fitting.”",934
"Just as a summary to tie a bow on things: the reason that it is not reasonable
to hope for the salvation for all is twofold. First, negatively, we have no
good reason to think that all will be saved. Second, positively, we have
testimony of Scripture as interpreted by the greatest doctors of the Church
and the weight of the Church fathers denying the position of Origen. From this
weight of this tradition, we find nothing like VB's mere wish given the
misnomer ""hope"" (which is a theological virtue). Where then did VB get his
inspiration for this position: again, as I noted above, it was influenced by
Barth who had little role for cooperation with grace in his thought. From his
foregone position, VB misrepresented the weight of tradition in the reading of
the Church Fathers. He did not find something that no other theologian had
seen that was actually present in the tradition. He creatively misrepresented
the tradition to bend his ""research"" in the direction of foregone conclusions.  
  
So, in the spirit of your suggestion above, if you wish to part company with
the great saints and doctors noted above in order to keep company with Origen,
Barth, and Balthasar: ""that is your decision"". It is a bad decision, but it is
surely yours if you make it.",1264

the Anonymous who posted at 4:44 pm, so: call me ""Forty-four"".  
  
2\. Also for clarity's sake, I DO NOT believe that Hell is empty, and I do
accept the weight of Tradition.  
  
However, so far as I am aware (and this is of course limited - I have not read
most of the Fathers & Doctors), there is no specific biblical passage that
tells us in certain and definitive terms that THERE ARE some in Hell. It is,
therefore, (so far as I know), remotely, vaguely possible to suggest that the
biblical passages that point toward Hell are all to be understood as
contingent: e.g. contingent on the sinner(s) not repenting.  
  
_More than this, the scenario is *not possible* given the fact that Christ has
revealed to us than many will in fact follow the path to destruction._  
  
For all those huge numbers on the road to destruction, they will REACH
destruction...if they do not repent. Suppose that **every single** person on
Earth (other than Christ and Mary) will be on that road at some point in their
lives, and so that road is very, very wide, and heavily populated. But we also
know that SOME who are on that road turn around and head the other way - they
repent.  
  
Therefore, not everyone who is on the road to destruction _reaches_
destruction. What if 90% who are on the road right now, repent: the heavy
population of the road right now tells us nothing about the ratio of those who
end up in hell. What if it's 99%? What if it's 100% who repent?  
  
Christ will, at the end of time, judge all people. Those who are judged to be
goats will go off to final perdition. What if the class of ""the goats"" happens
to have no members - an empty set? The _class_ is still a valid concept,
because of the contingent possibility that some might not have repented.  
  
I repeat: I don't think this what the weight of Tradition is pointing toward.
I think that Christ **repeatedly** pointed out the dangers of Hell because
there ARE people going to Hell. But I also recognize a difference between
""that's the best sense of the passages"" and ""that's definitively what the
passages mean without any quibble or room for any other sense.""",2215

missed the entire point of Christianity. It seems unlikely to me that they are
unaware of whatever influences VB acquired. Yes I understand that there are
levels of hope, but VB does qualify this with “reasonable” and those I
mentioned are/were very well aware of it. As for why you should hold a
position so contrary to the state of our corrupt society that is up to you.",681

it is a “necessary truth” that all will be saved. This appears to be Harts

is something we can “reasonably” hope for. This seems a sensible position to
me and hardly heretical.",406
"If one cannot grasp that saying “Necessity cannot attach to him who is perfect

A God who merely chooses to create–as one equally possible exercise of
deliberative will among others–is either actualizing a potential beyond his
nature (in which case he is not God, but a god only) or he is actualizing some
otherwise unrealized potential within himself (in which case, again, he is not
God, but a god only).  
  
Both are quotes from DBH. These both make perfect sense to me and seem to be

"For example, many divine actions are described in scripture in a manner that
implies that God would not have taken them had certain contingent conditions
been different, such as his punishment of sinners at the time of Noah and at
Sodom and Gomorrah. Of course, that does not entail that God really went
through some reasoning process, as we do, before acting. The point is that the
clear implication of these texts is that people could have acted other than
the way they did, and that had they done so, _God_ would have done something
other than what he actually did.",568

"Tadeo,  
  
This is a great question that has been considered by great theologians like
St. Augustine. The answer lies partly in God's relationship to time. God does
not learn things that occur in history. He sees them all in one glance because
he is outside time. He is not bound by it, but he is the cause of the
existence of all that is bound by time. So in one glance He sees all things
and He sees all things in relation to Himself. This pertains to Aristotle's
thought thinking self. God knows all things as being caused by Himself. He
sees in Himself the cause of all things and sees all things as caused by Him.
This entails that all things (such as our prayers) can only be known in the
full sense with reference to God who is the cause of our existence while
praying and the cause of the very beings about which are prayers are concerned
(e.g. our children or parents or friends, etc). This pertains also to His Will
because, in seeing all things at once, He does not will things in acts that
are temporally distinguished. In the unity of the Divine Will flowing out of
the unity of Divine knowledge of all things created, all created things are
willed by Him. This unity of the Divine will in the act of creation is an act
of Divine Goodness. It is a sharing of HIs goodness with the created order.
This is a Trinitarian act because Christ is the Word of God through whom He
speaks the world into existence and the Spirit is the love of the Divine Will
by which He wills the world from His Goodness. I would like to add more, but
cannot due to time, but perhaps later I can do so.",1591

This is an old problem Augustine struggled with. God is claimed to be just,

included in the mystery of the Redemption and with each one Christ has united
himself for ever through this mystery. Every man comes into the world through
being conceived in his mother's womb and being born of his mother, and
precisely on account of the mystery of the Redemption is entrusted to the
solicitude of the Church. Her solicitude is about the whole man and is
focussed on him in an altogether special manner. The object of her care is man
in his unique unrepeatable human reality, which keeps intact the image and
likeness of God himself92. The Council points out this very fact when,
speaking of that likeness, it recalls that ""man is the only creature on earth
that God willed for itself""93. Man as ""willed"" by God, as ""chosen"" by him from
eternity and called, destined for grace and glory-this is ""each"" man, ""the

Soul is problematic. The Pentateuch speaks of soul as breath, a life force,
vitalism. Not a soul as modern day Christians imagine that. The Bible is not
clear on what a soul is. So Catholic catechisms are rather vague. Where do
souls come from? Two hypotheses. God creates them de novo or they are created
by Google occasionalism for that. In the end, this attempt failed nd our
parents. Since the Bible gives no clues about what a soul is,there is no real
answer here. Aristotle in De Anima claims soul is hylomorphic. Form of a
substance. Man has the form of intelligence, reason. Which Aristotle claims is
eternal, immortal and can exist without a substance, a body. A rather
extensive debat on soul and nature of soul took place in the 17nth century
with Rene Descartes, Leibnez and other theologians and philossophers. Nobody
could prove a soul exists, its nature, or how it interacts with physical
matter. Google occasionalsm for mre. That debate faded away with no solution,
no answer, no conclusion. This resulting in systemic naturalism. Science
became divorced from theology, the Orthodox Catholic scientist and rank
atheist scientist did science in the same way.

"End quote. Note that Hart takes what amounts to a compatibilist view of divine
freedom. That is to say, he claims that God’s being free is compatible with
his being unable not to create the world. Now, as Rooney says, this
contradicts Christian orthodoxy. To be sure, the tradition affirms that God is
unable positively to will _evil_ , specifically, and that the ability to do so
would indeed be a defect in his freedom. But it also insists that he was
nevertheless able not to create this particular world, or indeed any world at
all. For Christian orthodoxy, the claim is not (contra Hart) merely that the
world could have failed to exist.  It is that God could have refrained from
bringing it into being. It is a claim not merely about the nature of the
_creation_ , but also about the nature of the _creator_.",814
"Now to top things off, there is a common and sinful calumny that comes from
the recent disciples of VB that those who believe that hell is and will be

coins, but instead they are counting the number of souls in hell and
delighting in every enumeration of an additional soul. Those who make these
calumnious accusations will answer to the judge of the living and the dead
whether or not they believe in the final judgement. Uncharitable habits such
as these occur again in the writings of David Hart. The convenient thing about
being a universalist is that you can ignore Christ’s commandment to love your
neighbor in charitable discourse and can look upon everyone who disagrees with
you as an idiot. The inconvenient part about being a universalist is that you
will answer to the judge of the living and the dead for the damnable
consequences of such a lack of charity. In my estimation, the inconvenient
part heavily outweighs the convenient part.  
  
So now to address this calumny. The reason that I care about this issue is the
same reason that the popes who condemned positions like what I noted above
cared about them. I care about the issue because I care about souls and it is
extremely dangerous for people to believe that no one will (or may) ultimately
be in hell. It makes Christ's warnings vacuous. I makes the two ways noted in
the Didache and the warning abouts life and death in Deuteronomy vacuous. A
child that knows his dad will never spank him even though the dad threatens a
spanking will at least be tempted to despise his father knowing that he will
never make good on his threats. Viewing God as an indulgent of our sins such
that He makes threats that will never be realized in any instance is
completely absurd. it is for this reason that the position of VB is absurd. As

"@Tanner  
Your second DBH quote is bunk. Turn to the first option he attacks, and ask
what it means for a potential to be “beyond” the divine nature. I think his
second prong suggests he is using “beyond” to mean “distinct from”. For, to
reach his conclusion, this internal, unrealized potency must mean something
that truly is part of God, thus undermining several essential attributes.  
If I’m interpreting him correctly, I can’t help but wonder, what’s the
problem? It shouldn’t be that God is realizing what could be called an
objective potency. I see three possibilities for how that might threaten God’s
claims to divinity:  
1\. It undermines his aseity  
2\. It threatens his immutability  
3\. It does away with his simplicity  
But it’s far from clear that realizing an objective potency does any of those
things. There’s no reason to suppose that making a choice involves any kind of
change on the choosing agent’s part, for example.  
And we can already see why divine aseity goes on unscathed. An “objective
potency”, as I’ve dubbed it here, takes it for granted that the possible thing
doesn’t actually exist. It’s merely a possibility, for something that isn’t
self-existing. Or are we supposed to think that because God is the ultimate
ground for modality, that every objective potency is just one of God’s passive
potencies? Is there any reason to believe that? I won’t take it just because

distinct from what active potencies, which might also be called causal powers.
God has all causal powers —and so is omnipotent—, and therefore is capable of
creating all possible beings, not merely those beings that have, do, or will
exist in this world.

"Why are 1 and 2 being called out as distance possibilities? It seems to me
that 1 is just a subset of 2. You can rephrase 2 as “humans were created by
God such that we cannot do otherwise than to love God” in which case 1 here is
just one of the two possible reasons for 2, either God could have created us
otherwise or he couldn’t.  
  
Since 1 entails 2, what is gained by arguing against 1 specifically? It seems
like if you can prove that 2 leads to unacceptable conclusions, then worrying
about whether or not God could have created us some other way is irrelevant.",570

I believe that St. Augustine itself that said that prayer does not change God
but rather prepare us to receive His graces. Father Paulo Ricardo(you know
him?) Cited this phrase some time ago.  
  
Both questions are answered by St. Thomas on part I of the Suma Theologica, so
you should check the part about Our God atributes. But going fast:  
  
God does not learn something new or change His mind when we pray, rather His
knowledge of this world, including our choices, is know to Him because He
knows Himself perfectly and so knows Himself as the efficient(and sustaining)
cause of this world, including us and oue prayers.  
  
He also does not need to stop and create new souls as by starting a new
action, for by His one eternal act of the creation of the world not only the
world starts to be but He also sustain every single creature by His eternal
act. Remember that God is completely outside time and space, so when a human
conception happens He does not look at it and say ""oh,, better create a
soul!"", in a way He already did it.  
  
I know that all this generate several questions, but we do have our boy St.
Thomas, so i really recomend studying the ST part about God and His atributes.

gradation of being. The issue is that VB is speaking about a mere wish using a
term that is most prominently used in the tradition to refer to the
theological virtue of hope. What VB describes is not this virtue. What he
describes is a mere wish and uses languages that is overwhelmingly used in the
tradition to refer to a theological virtue that is based on God's promises.

"I’m really not so sure that’s the case. There are legions of online Christians
- Catholic orthodox, and protestant alike - wrestling with this issue in
comboxes all over the Web and I cannot tell you how many people honestly
believe that Hart’s argument boils down to: “There’s no punishment. What you
do in this life ultimately doesn’t matter. God will love you and save you and
have mercy on you and there’s nothing to fear in the afterlife (so don’t worry
about evangelizing, either!)”.  
  
I totally get that you, Dr. phaser, understand hearts position. But Fr.
Rooney’s summary, at least as you’ve posted it says “impossible to go to
hell”, which is absolutely not what Hart argues. Unless I’m missing something,
that’s just a straight-up willful misreading of the text.",776
"Tony, if I understand your post, I agree with most of what you say in it.
Thanks to Dr. Feser, I know what an order is in Wullner's sense of that word.
But I doubt that sanctifying grace makes a non-Catholic a member of the
Church.  
  
I doubt that Pope Pius XII and Msgr. Joseph Clifford Fenton tell us the
difference between being a member of the Church and being in the Church as a
nonmember of it.  
  
Pius XII and Fenton say that only Catholics are members of the Church since
each member of it must meet four requirements. He must wear the baptismal mark
on his soul, profess Catholicism, be willing to submit to the pope and to the
Church's other legitimate hierarchy, and not be under full excommunication. By
those standards, a Protestant in sanctifying grace is in the Church as a
nonmember of it.  
  
But the dogma that there's salvation in only the Catholic Church is still true
because people can be in the Church as nonmembers of it.  
  
See Mystici Corporis Christi and Msgr. Joseph Clifford Fenton's book ""The
Catholic Church and Salvation.""  
  
A non-Catholic is in the Church if there's sanctifying grace in his soul. So
he'll die in her if he's in that grace when he does. But his sect doesn't get
him to heaven. If he reaches it, he does that despite that sect, not because
of it.  
  
That's why Blessed Pope Pius IX writes:  
""Our Predecessor, Gregory XVI, an “insanity,”2 viz., that “liberty of
conscience and worship is each man’s personal right, which ought to be legally
proclaimed and asserted in every rightly constituted society; and that a right
resides in the citizens to an absolute liberty, which should be restrained by
no authority whether ecclesiastical or civil, whereby they may be able openly
and publicly to manifest and declare any of their ideas whatever, either by
word of mouth, by the press, or in any other way.” But, while they rashly
affirm this, they do not think and consider that they are preaching “liberty
of perdition;”3 and that “if human arguments are always allowed free room for
discussion, there will never be wanting men who will dare to resist truth, and
to trust in the flowing speech of human wisdom; whereas we know, from the very
teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ, how carefully Christian faith and wisdom
should avoid this most injurious babbling.”4""  
  
From what you're telling me, I must have misinterpreted John Paul's quotation
from Redemptor Hominis. But his Assisi meetings and Vatican II's religious
liberty may make some non-Catholics likely to die outside the Church.  
I quote Pius IX's Quanta Cura because although each non-Catholic at Pope John
Paul II's fiirst Assisi meeting in 1986 was possibly in the Church, hi sect",2705

Michael says:  
_This includes following the warning of Christ to ""make every effort to enter
through the narrow gate"". Your reading would require that this should be
interpreted: ""You don't really need to make any effort at all because everyone
will (or might) get into heave without being on the path or without trying.""_  
  
Nope. Not what I am saying - I think there are people in Hell. Nor is it what
**must** be said of those who suggest the _possibility_ that many / most / all
accept the grace of repentance just before death. Suppose you are a smoker,
and confessor tells you: ""give up smoking, or you're going to spend 300
billion years in Purgatory suffering pains 10 times the worst pain you have
ever felt so far"". The warning is given in the most urgent possible terms:
DON'T BE AN IDIOT - the pleasures of a few more years of smoking just aren't
worth that amount of suffering! Go the strait and narrow path now, to avoid
that horrible period of suffering.  
  
Again, I don't think that's what Christ meant. The issue isn't simply **what's
the most reasonable reading, but rather _is there ANY_ room at all for a
different reading. Throw in the passages that DO seem to speak of God saving

Regarding salvation being contingent on folks repenting: that is true and you

the slightest reason to think that every single soul will repent before death
and end up in heaven. We don't have a shred of evidence for that proposition.
More than this, we have the clear teaching of Christ that many will not repent
as they will follow the broad path that leads to destruction rather than
following the narrow path that leads to life. Again, few will find it.

Hey bro! I said that they are 'materialists' not in the technical sense, but
because of the consequences. Because for materialists in the technical sense -
if they are to be coherent at all - they should say that people do not exist.
But in the buddhist sense, not only people do not exist and there is just
suffering but the world is always trying to deceive you. I don't need to
canvas it more for you to see how much worse it is. There is simply no
happiness at all and no one to see any good of it. It seems that ideology
takes all of the best in the world and turn it into misery.  
  
In the cellphone example, they somehow believe in regularities but, as far as
I understand, they are very close to the Humean causality type - or proto-
humean. They say that causality is in some sense mind only or something we
'associate' but it's in some sense not really there (I think that's somehow
related to why they are nominalists too). If this is coherent at the end of
the day (I think that it's not) is another story - and that's what I want to
know because something as evil as that CAN'T BE REAL.  
  
During these years I tried to formulate ways in showing how that can't be true
- I will put them in the other post. But man the problem is even if I somehow
'showed' that, I can't prove it to myself. You may think how that's possible
but the problem is the OCD - this thing keeps hitting my head 24/7 and it
seems that I can't go further. Since you don't have it I can describe that it
hits differently. Looks like my arguments are always wrong or that they will
have somehow a way to evade it. For people that do not have it, it seems
ridiculous, but for me, it hits really hard to the point that doesn't matter
how I try to formulate it, and I always forget the rest of the arguments and
need to repeat them to myself. It looks like hell because I'm never out of the
same place and looks like I learn nothing - just keep suffering.  
  
I will try to formulate all the points that give me hope that demonic ideology
(buddhism) is wrong in the open-topic post. I will try to put my best in there
and try to be coherent all the way through. Maybe someone sees the effort I
put in all these years trying to save myself from this miserable condition
that I am in and hopefully helps me to get rid of that demonic ideology once
and for all.

On the buddhist type of view*: a very important teaching of it is that
essences do not exist at all,, there are what we aristotelians call acidents

Of course, you already can see the problem: how exactly can things happen? Why
do i touch the cellphone screen and it does not turn into smoke or grow in
size? We can answer that both me and the cellphone have natures that organize
ua to have certain capacities and limitations, but what can the buddhist do?  
  
I even read Nagarjuna once and can't remember he adressing that. His work was
more negative but his arguments really showed how Aristotle was necessary on
India! It does not seems to me that we could have anything happening if we did
not have essences, so Aristotle wins again.

"WCB, I've emailed with Seventh-day Adventists who believe that a soul is a
complete human person with a material body. So they quote Genesis in the KJV

But other Protestant Bibles say ""living being"" instead. That alternative
phrase suggests that God's breath represents Adam's soul. If it does, it's
easy to see that interpretation of the passage supports the Catholic doctrine
that a new human person begins when a human sperm fertilizes a human ovum. It
also explains why the Catholic Church teaches that deliberate abortion is
always murder.  
  
The Adventist idea that a human soul is a complete human person makes it hard
to know why Our Lord says, ""My soul is sorrowful, even unto death."" Since he
has a human nature, he has a human body and a human soul. But if he talked as
though he was only a body-soul composite, that would hint that he was only

will of God;’ and our own calling, as itself once not being, but now taking

been made ‘according to the good pleasure of His will’ (Ephesians 1:5). And
what Moses relates, ‘Let there be light,’ and ‘Let the earth appear,’ and ‘Let
Us make man,’ is, I think, according to what has gone before, significant of

Guys, thank you so much for the words. It really means a lot to me. I'm

how it really warms our hearts when people care for us. So thank you, thank
you so much!  
  
@Michael, I saw the post that Ed made with an open thread and I will
participate! Today was the first day in weeks that I felt a little bit better.
I will try somehow engage in the arguments there, because like I said, I'm not
worried about materialism per se (even though the existence of atoms and etc.
sometimes puzzle me as to why God makes the world that way, you know? Why the
micro exists in a way that it 'seems' that things could be ""reduced"" to them)
because of the arguments Ed presented in the prolegomenon of the Scholastics
Meta (I only believed materialism in this XXI century sense because I was a
foolish boy born in a country that philosophy that is seriously engaging in
these points marginally exists - yeah continental philosophy sucks).  
  
My problem is the worse version of 'materialism' that is the buddhist (because
in practice, doesn't matter how they argue, the consequences are basically the
same but, surprisingly, worse). In these very difficult (to say the least) 3
years of my life. What really broke me from the inside (based on what I was
talking about Libet) is the fact that I (and the person that I love with my
life in this world, my mom, who's in fact the only family that I have in
practice) could indeed be a substance per accidens (to use the best
terminology) - because ALL of these ideologies like reductionism, materialism,
and especially buddhism will lead to that no matter how they try to persuade
or say otherwise. They will inevitably treat human beings as unreal and
aggregates or 'useful fictions' (sometimes I think that it was the devil
himself who plunges these ideologies into our mentality).  
  
If there is one thing in all these 3 years that I do not forget was the pain
(the mental pain and depression) that I felt and still feel. In my 24 years of
life, nothing EVER hit me like that. And I don't know how people simply
swallow materialism or even worse buddhism of these sorts - if they do really
love their own kind ones or have any moral principles about persons at all -
they should be rejecting it immediately. Because as I said what caused me all
that trauma that still scares me today is the possibility of those things (i.e
the fact that we are just an aggregate or unreal and live just to suffer).
It's simply devilish. Why would anyone want to live in a world like that? You
know.",2703

would no doubt be interpreted by Hart in a compatibilist way. But there are
also passages that rule out such an interpretation.",424

seem to differ. Vehemently  
  
Some really do seem to get emotional about this. Perhaps they are picturing a
favorite icon like Stalin, or Marx, or even Lyndon Johnson, in Hell; which is
an amusing reaction - the indignation that is - but not really helpful.  
  
Hart has himself shruggingly said, in effect, that if he is a heretic, then,
you know, so be it. He has clearly announced his preference for, and
commitment to, his own pantheibabble eructations over orthodox doctrine; and
he will have it his way - warbling defiance Sinatra style - come Hell or high
water. He's got his ""precious"" and he ain't giving it up. So beautiful, so
shiny, so soothing ... so lovingly and long polished.  
  
Perhaps there is something to be gleaned from the reactions ... after all, the
Virgin Mary of the approved apparitions, herself entreats the various
visionaries to pray for the poor souls on their way to damnation. ""Poor
souls"": that's an interesting way to look at them. I might not care about
their fate, but she does. And I have to admit that according to reports Hell
is indeed a hellish place, which once you gain a whiff of it, you would not
wish on your own worst enemy ... though on these same reports, the residents
of Hell might in fact have wished it for themselves through a rather perverse
celebration of their own unbreakable wills.

that saying ""all men are categorically saved"", is not the same in the final
logical reduction as saying that ""no men can fail to be saved no matter what
they do"" ... i.e., "" cannot not be saved"", or something along those lines.
There's an important operating distinction there somewhere ... we are assured.

"No, most certainly not. JPII, like his predecessors, acknowledges that God
**calls** all to holiness, and even _orders_ them toward holiness so that
holiness is their only true end. And by constituting the Church to be His
agent of grace on Earth, God ordains all to receive the truth and grace from
the treasures of the Church. (And all who receive sanctifying grace ARE in
fact members of that Church, even if they are not expressly aware of it.) Thus
the life of grace constitutes for EVERY man the wholeness and fullness of
life, a sharer in Jesus Christ _in fact_ after being, from the moment of first
conception, a sharer IN POTENTIA _by ordination toward_ that life, and by
Christ's great mission to make disciples of all nations.  
  
JPII expresses this most clearly in saying _as ""chosen"" by him from eternity
and called, destined for grace and glory..._ The chosing is from all eternity,
and is universal in the sense of all being _ordered toward_ the life of grace

be entertained of the eternal salvation of all those who are not at all in the
true Church of Christ"" (17). This condemnation draws from a previous
encyclical entitled Quanto Conficiamur.  
  
So the suggestion that there is good reason to hope for the salvation of all
men has been condemned by the Church. Balthasar was aware of this and would
not have gone so far as to say that we have good reason to hope for the
salvation of everyone. To make this assertion is again to affirm what the
Church has condemned.  
  
Where does this leave the position of Balthasar? It leaves him with a hope
that is based neither in reason nor in revelation. It leaves him with an
irrational hope. That is the problem with the position: it is rooted neither
in reason nor revelation.  
  
In the Tradition, the overwhelming weight of the Church Fathers is against the
positions of Gregory of Nyssa and Origen and a couple of clever theologians do
not overturn the weight of a broad range of Church Fathers that includes a
great number of doctors of the Church.  
  
It certainly doesn't overturn the words of Christ that ""the way is narrow and
*few will find it*"" (Mt. 7:14). These words are not taken seriously by those
in the Balthasar camp. Balthasar's position on this issue was influenced by
the reformed theologian Karl Barth. Such theologians have an account of
election that has little place for human freedom and secondary causality. They
read salvation as though God will save us without us. This is not the Catholic
position. The Catholic position is that we need to cooperate with God's grace
to be saved.  
  
So, the Balthasarian position in order to remain orthodox on this point would
have to posit that we should hope that everyone in history has, is, and will
cooperate with God's grace. Well, we might ask the disciples of Balthasar,
what reason do we have for thinking that everyone in the world has, is, and
will cooperate with God's grace? Oh, you don't have a good reason to think
that? Well why in the world would I hold a position that has no rational basis
and is widely rejected by the Church Fathers? Why would I hold a position that
is so manifestly contrary to the state of our corrupt society? It don't have
to even know about the gulags to see that the suggestion that everyone is
cooperating with God's grace is an entirely baseless assertion. I just have to
look around me.",2711

"Regarding your suggestion that it is up to me why I should hold a position
that is contrary to the state of our society and that this is ""up to me"": Well
this is true, but profoundly unhelpful for our discussion. It is ""up to you""
whether you believe in fairies and goblins. You are ""free"" to believe in
fairies and goblins, but that does not make such a belief rooted in Scripture
or Tradition. Nor does it make it reasonable. And choices that are rooted
neither in reason nor revelation are baseless. Such ""freedom"" is really no
freedom at all. It is a sheer willfulness to believe whatever I want to
believe regardless of reason, evidence, and revelation. That is the point.
Authentic freedom is always rooted in reason and/or revelation. In other
words, authentic freedom is always rooted in the truth. If I have neither
reason nor revelation to support my belief in fairies, then it is unreasonable
to do so. If you wish to believe in fairies because they give you warm fuzzy
feelings, you are ""free"" to do so, but that does not make your choice a good
choice. It makes it baseless just as your choice to believe that everyone may
be going to heaven is baseless.  
  
This leads to the biggest problem with the position: counterfactuals. As
Edward Feser has noted, it is part of the Tradition that rational beings are
in hell, namely Satan and His Angels. It is also clear from Scripture that the
way is narrow and few will find it. Now some passages of Scripture are
difficult to interpret and admit varying interpretations. However, if one's
""interpretation"" involves denying or ignoring the testimony of Scripture, then
this is not really an interpreation so much as a denial of the explicit
teaching of Sripture. So if Scripture teaches that the way to eternal life is
narrow and few will find it and I say it is broad and everyone will (or might
find), then I am denying revelation. Who will or will not be saved is not
something you or I could know apart from revelation. However, it is something
that God knows and He has revealed to us that ""few will find it"". It is more
than mental gymnastics to interpret this as ""everyone will find it"", it is a
denial of the words of Christ who is in a better position than you or I to
tell us whether the road is broad or narrow and whether few or many will find
it.",2318
"I am not positive about this, but it is my sense of Rooney's argument is that
Hart's necessitarianism would have it that: _granted that God DID IN FACT

evidence of a created world with humans, an independent observer could not
have KNOWN that God necessarily MUST create a world with humans, but that's a
gap in the observer's knowing, not a gap in the necessity of God's so acting._

What about those who are ""in the true Church"" in some (qualified) sense and

**the very reason** Pius added ""at all"" to the sentence.  
  
Is it **impossible** for God to do the following: for each sinner, one
hundredth of a second before the point the soul leaves the body, take their
faculties up into a confrontation with Him, enlighten them and give them the
grace of conversion, and then while they have sanctifying grace and are thus
""in the true Church of Christ"", die? Each such sinner would die in the true
Church. Is there a limit to how many God has the power save this way?  
  
As I understand it, Pius's named error regards having hope even for those who
reject the Church _all the way_ to their death, so that they die in the
condition of being wholly and in every sense not members of the Church. It
seemingly _does not_ refer to someone who repents of their (earlier)
repudiation of the Church, and embraces the Church willingly, regardless of
how little time there is between their repenting and their death, (i.e.
regardless of whether their conversion could be known by outward signs because
there is so little time).",1404
"I have read Hart's ""That All Shall Be Saved"" and as far as I remember nothing
in his argument required necessitarianism of any kind.  
  
Yes, he did argue that it is IMPOSSIBLE for human beings to be damned. And
yes, in a way he did argue that it was IMPOSSIBLE for God not to save all the
people he had made, given God's moral perfection. But again, both of these
propositions are fully compatible with God deciding to not create anything at
all, or deciding to create a universe with no people. The only thing that
follows from the impossibility of eternal damnation is the impossibility of
eternal damnation, not that God absolutely had to create our universe and save
everyone, or even had to create (and save) any people.  
  
Whether Hart actually defends necessitarianism in other works might very well
be possible. But it is completely irrelevant for universalism as well as his
specific argument.  
  
Fr. Rooney says ""If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something
makes it so..."" but again, when universalists say that it is necessary that
God will save everyone, they are speaking of a conditional necessity, I.e.
GIVEN that God has created people, it is impossible that he would then fail to
save all of them. The universalist is not saying that it is necessary for God
to CREATE any world or a specific world and then save everyone; he is just
saying it is impossible for God to create people and then have them be lost
forever to eternal damnation or annihilation.

teaching of facts that there are racists or white supremacists. But it does
bar making white students apologise to black students for transgressions of
the past or teaching that the white people of today have innate racism of
which they don't know about. This is literally what is being taught in
schools, muti national corporations etc. And it's not just white people, any
group that has a had any measure of success in the system namely Asians, has
been accused of pandering to the so called White Supremacists. If people are
banning CRT at the college level is wrong but at the school level, there is
really no need to teach children that America's social and economic structures
are supposedly inherently designed to prevent the success of minorities. There
may be particular people in the system who are acting in a racist way, that's

old' days, to simpler times.  
  
All of Feser's bogeymen, the most feared catholic demons are there: Marxism,
postmodernism, liberation theology, and CRT. And Feser's manufactured
rendition of CRT is intellectually and philosophically mistaken. Just as the
extremely lucky that have had the good fortune of overcoming the psychological
ravages and effects of Stockholm syndrome can attest, how easy it is for
Catholics on this site to play the 'victimhood' card, that white people are
being. ""... suckered into a spiral of endless self-abasement"". While-ever
proponents such as Dr Feser deliberately choose to link Catholic thought as
synonymous to the wholesale debasement of CRT going forward, my work is easy.
I have no need to effect anything that isn't already the ineluctable result of
the shrivelling of catholic thought. The seeds of its own destruction are
deeply embedded within its own character.  
It is egregiously misplaced for Dr Feser to argue from a perspective that is
entirely unfounded. CRT does not, I repeat, does not teach that any race is
inherently racist or superior, but it does teach how race is deeply ingrained
in our history. The dozen or so States that have legislated against the
'teaching of CRT' in schools, banning books and curricular material across the
country is the stuff of authoritarianism, not of democracies. It is nothing
less than a cynical and forlorn attempt not only at erasing a somewhat sorry
chapter in human relations but equally, the wholesale whitewashing of American
history.  
Nothing good will come of Dr Feser's approach. An entrenched position does not
a discourse make.  
And this is sad.",2257

"""Decrying the fact that Whites are beginning to no longer be the majority in
America""  
  
I honestly haven't seen any serious conservative thinker (And I don't include
the reactionary commentary of people like those at the daily wire) who has
ever decried that white people are no longer going to be the majority in
America.  
  
Most sane conservative commentators decry both the excesses of the far right
and the far left.  
  
To quote a piece from one of the best natural law theorists alive on the
planet today Prof J Budziszewski  
  
""Progressives like to say that a racist doctrine they call “replacement
theory” is very big on the right.  
  
I won’t say there is no such theory. There is. Actually, though, versions of
the theory are held both on the farthest, farthest fringes of the right and –
more quietly – among large, large sections of the left.  
  
The right wing version is that immigrants, especially immigrants of color,
outbreed people who were born in the country, so that descendants of the
former will “replace” descendants of the latter. This is supposed to be bad.  
  
The left wing version is that immigrants, especially immigrants of color,
trend more to the left than people who were born in the country, so that
leftists will “replace” conservatives. This is supposed to be good.  
  
Both versions of the theory are nuts.  
  
As to the former version: If the country becomes browner in a few generations,
so be it. People who are too selfish to have children deserve to be “replaced”
by people who love them.  
  
As to the latter version: Immigrants who are acquainted with the politics of
the country are often quite conservative; they don’t want to lose what they’ve
worked and suffered to attain. So if left-wingers think immigration will lead
to the “replacement” of conservatives by liberals, they may have it
backwards.""

" _in the misbegotten attempt of thinking that such a strategy will drag
Catholic thought into the mainstream from the periphery,_  
  
That's just plain goofy, stupid nonsense. It is the norm in polite
conversation to attribute to an author, (or to a speaker) motives that are
credible and reasonable, if any are _plausibly available_ (and if the author
doesn't explicitly say otherwise, that is). Charging Feser with this as his
motive is just plain idiotic.  
  
If Feser has not credibly identified the real Catholic response to CRT, then
his attack on CRT cannot be identified with ""Catholicism"" anyway. If, however,
Feser has credibly identified the real Catholic response to CRT, then he won't
be **_dragging_** Catholic thought anywhere, mainstream or not.  
  
Moreover, Feser is well aware that _real_ Catholic principles and thinking
have been rejected by the mainstream in the West for decades now, and nothing
he does is likely to affect the ""mainstream"" anyway.  
  
But much more importantly, some philosophers, like Feser, feel it worthwhile
to state what they consider to be the truth _whether it sways ANYBODY_ or not:
merely _testifying_ to the Truth is a right Christian act. It's motivation is
not a power-grab or a ""trick"" to manipulate others into feeding their own

everyone's motivation IS power-politics of some form or other.)",1428

Marxim has nothing to do with noting the history of racism in America in the
academic setting of CRT. And that handwave arguments that do not demonstrate

and fight systemic racism, why that is bad. And why American conservatives
have chronically failed to take the problems of America's systemic racism

""Critical"" in the very name but that tradition?  
  
From the Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's page on ""Critical Theory"":  
  
""According to these theorists, a 'critical' theory may be distinguished from a
'traditional' theory according to a specific practical purpose: a theory is
critical to the extent that it seeks human 'emancipation from slavery', acts
as a 'liberating … influence', and works 'to create a world which satisfies
the needs and powers of' human beings (Horkheimer 1972b [1992, 246]). Because
such theories aim to explain and transform all the circumstances that enslave
human beings, many 'critical theories in the broader sense have been
developed. They have emerged in connection with the many social movements that
identify varied dimensions of the domination of human beings in modern
societies.  
  
...While Critical Theory is often thought of narrowly as referring to the
Frankfurt School that begins with Horkheimer and Adorno and stretches to
Marcuse and Habermas, any philosophical approach with similar practical aims
could be called a 'critical theory,' including feminism, critical race theory,
and some forms of post-colonial criticism."" (Bohman, 2021, paras. 1-2)

"The bishop's office of ""teacher"" is not exercised ONLY when he _expressly_
""intends to bind the faithful"" in an _unreserved_ way, for a bishop _cannot_
bind the faithful in that way because he is not infallible. But he still
exercises the office of teacher when he teaches in such a way that he expects
his people to hear _and receive and be guided by_ his teaching. This is what
the magisterial office _means_. The pope, in exercising his _ordinary_ office
of bishop of Rome, exercises the same magisterial authority as any bishop
does. But by being the pope, his teaching acts also teach the whole world. It
is impossible for him to teach ""just Rome"" and not implicitly teach to the
world.  
  
Just as is true of ALL the bishops, who teach their teachings in various
**degrees** of definitude by which they intend others to receive them, so also
does the pope. When he indicates, by details such as formality of venue, tone
of voice, and declarative mood, that a teaching is more definitive than usual,
we are obliged to give it a greater degree of respect, (i.e. to assent to it
with less _reserve_ than usual). As a result of these truths, it will be
automatically the case that when the pope wishes to be _especially_
definitive, he will typically be doing so especially _to the world_. But even
THERE, he has degrees available: if the pope gives a speech to an
international forum of obstetricians and speaks there about the immorality of
certain tubal ligations (as contraceptive), it is inevitable that he be
speaking broadly to the whole world, in that those doctors are from the whole
world and will repeat his teaching around the world. But the venue is not as
_formal_ as an encyclical, and so has a lesser degree of definitude - lesser
sense that he ""intends to bind"" - as to that aspect. The intention he has is
CAPABLE OF DEGREE. Hence the deference we give it must be capable of degree.  
  
Once we realize that religious assent - the kind of assent that is not the
""unreserved"" assent given to infallible teachings - is **reserved** assent, we
must realize that it comes in many flavors just as do the reservations by
which it is not **UN** reserved. And the _intention to bind_ is also present
in many degrees.",2230

They're not explicitly stating that, but it's implicit in the doctrine of
infallibility. That's why theologians distinguish between active infallibility
and passive infallibility. The Pope is actively infallible in proclaiming a
doctrine and we are passively infallible in accepting it and asserting it
ourselves.  
  
""So our fallibility has no logical bearing...""  
  
I think it does. Do you not agree that Orthodox, Muslims et al have succumbed
to fallibility in denying Papal infallibility and claiming an infallibility of
their own? Obviously you do. My problem is that I don't see how you've escaped
the fallibility that you yourself fully accept applies to others. And it's
obvious that if you or I had been born, say, Orthodox or Muslim in an Orthodox

err in his non-infallible pronouncements, but I disagree that the Magisterium
- and Dr. Feser argues that his letters here are a part of the Magisterium (I
am not convinced) - can ever teach heresy as defined by Vatican I, because
then the Magisterium would be leading believers off the path of salvation. As

that _manifestly_ connects to and coordinates with the pieces of the prior
teachings that it IS meant to alter in some qualified way. It is true
development when a Catholic who accepted the old way of saying the teaching
can look at the new way and say of it: ""I see that this re-frames the old
concepts in a way that introduces a new distinction never made before, and is
not so much a _denial_ of the old teaching but a refinement of it."" When those
who have been holding to the old teaching CANNOT say anything like that,
indeed when the appearance (to them, in good faith) is that the new ""teaching""
really is just a flat out denial of the old, that's not _true development_ ,
and the **very lack of clarification given** should be taken as CONSTITUTING a
criterion by which the Church saying that the Church is not (yet) insisting on
the new ""teaching"" as binding.",1401

Oh, that was a easy agreement XD  
(Justin is right, lets complement)  
  
I can see the point of your view, it truly seems that our reasoning outside
mathematics is very uncertain. But, of course, disagreement by itself does not
says much. The evidence of the senses should be pretty certain and
uncontroversial but if you, say, go to a bunch of people that were there
during a discussion or even fight between two folks they care about, for
instance, you find that sense evidence can be the origin of disagreement as
well as metaphysics! If ideas matter to life, people will disagree.  
  
Our boy Descartes is simply wrong, we don't need certain knowledge to be
justified on our beliefs. Math deals with abstractions, so of course it will
have a degree of agreement than areas that deal with real life do not, every
step on the direction of particularity is a step away from certainty. And even
math has polemics, no?  
  
Anyway, i can see value in your epistemological criteria, specially on a non-
religious worldview, but it seems to me to ask for too much certitude. If we
have good reasons to a point of view on theology them we can believe in it.

Once we understand and apply the difference between certainty and
infallibility, we can overcome the problem.  
  
Newman's fallibility, or the fallibility of any other private individual (such
as you or me or the other posters on this site), is irrelevant, since no one
is using their supposed infallibility as the premise in an argument for papal
infallibility, or for anything else. No one is saying, 'I am infallible, so
accept what I say. QED.' So our fallibility has no logical bearing.  
  
Anyone can come to a valid rational certainty of a particular truth (whether
absolute certainty or reasonable moral certainty, as the case may be) based on
strong enough evidence before them in the particular case, even without a
generalised gift of infallibility. The conclusive evidence in the particular
instance shows them that their general vulnerability to false beliefs is not
actualised in that instance. (Otherwise, no one could ever be certain of
anything.)  
  
Also, can we only be certain of something as long as everyone else agrees with
us? Maybe we have had the chance to come across and consider evidence that
someone else has not.  
  
(By the way, Newman believed in papal infallibility, but didn't think the
First Vatican Council was an opportune moment for the Church to declare it.)",1332
"Well, I appreciate the compliment. The most I can say is that I don't think
it's possible to have total and absolute knowledge of anything. Even if I can
reason to it logically, there is a remote chance that I made an error at some
point.  
  
Now on matters like ""What is 2+2"" the odds of an error are astoundingly low to
the point we can just about dismiss it. But on something like ""What is the
true religion"", well, sure, I think the evidence points to Catholicism. I
might be wrong, but I have to do my best.",513

decrees authoritative. He didn’t say “I confirm it, _except for_ this part.”
It’s true that in his own accompanying condemnation, he limits his accusation
against Honorius to negligence in suppressing heresy and thereby polluting the
purity of the Roman See, and does not apply the label “heretic” to him. But
Leo doesn’t deny the truth of the council’s statement that Honorius was a
heretic. He just doesn’t mention it (just as he doesn’t mention other things
the council said).",556

That other fallible humans have a subjective certainty Y, that contradicts a
subjective certainty X belonging to my own fallible self, is no proof that X
could not be recognised by me as objectively valid. (As with the colour of
Fluffy the cat in my previous post) it's only a problem if all I knew about X
and Y were that they were beliefs belonging to this or that person.  
  
If all the knowledge that we had access to was that 'I believe X, you believe
Y', then since we are all fallible, there would be no grounds for preferring X
over Y in regard to their objective certainty.  
  
But the presupposition that all the knowledge to which we have access is of
the form 'I believe X, you believe Y', is a type of philosophical idealism:
'All we can directly know is the fact that something is someone's belief - we
cannot have direct knowledge of evidence for these beliefs in themselves,
whereby we can discriminate which are true and which are false.'  
  
But we do not grant this unproven idealist presupposition (which furthermore
is contradicted by our very experience of having direct awareness of
evidence); and so we are not led to the relativist conclusion.  
  
In short, we are not reduced to saying, 'Fallible person A says X, fallible
person B says Y - who knows?' Each fallible individual can turn to the actual
evidence, by which valid objective certainties can be established in
particular cases - even if in other particular cases, someone (myself or
others) fails to properly examine the evidence, and so actualizes in those
particular cases the abstract possibility of falling into error.  
  
I agree that my background and life history makes it more likely for me to
have ended up a Catholic than e.g. a Hindu. But that proves nothing. My
background also makes it more likely that I will have a valid objective
certainty of Pythagoras' Theorem, than if I had been born in 3000 BC. For
every individual, particular contingent circumstances channel us into a
position where we are more favourably placed than we otherwise would have been
to discover objective evidence for this or that truth. That does not
invalidate our objective certainty of those truths, once we have seen the
evidence. Again the principle: we must examine the actual evidence regarding X
(not matters about our background that are logically irrelevant to the truth
or falsity of X).  
  
And just on a couple of your other points:  
  
I can agree for the sake of argument that Newman's example regarding the
trustworthiness of John or Richard is for our purposes the least satisfactory
of his examples, since the nature of the 'evidence' for their trustworthiness
raises all sorts of other questions. (His example is nonetheless perhaps a
useful corrective against modelling our understanding of certainty primarily
on our experience of mathematical certainty, rather than on e.g. certainties
that occur in interpersonal relationships.)  
  
And the passive infallibility (according to Catholic teaching) of the whole
Body of the Faithful guided by the Holy Spirit, has no bearing on the topic of
an admittedly fallible individual, Catholic or not, coming to a valid
objective certainty in a particular case, by rationally examining evidence.

"When a pope (or bishop) teaches, he is using the teaching office of bishop.
That _just is_ the magisterial office.  
  
It doesn't matter whether he does so from a pulpit, in a private conversation,
in a letter to one individual, or in an encyclical to the world. ""To teach"" is
to be a ""magister"", and to use the office of teacher.  
  
What is affected by the medium is the _degree_ to which the teacher is
requiring assent by the hearer. The various (non-infallible) teachings of the
Church have varying degrees in which we give _reserved_ assent, i.e. the
proper assent due from us given the manner in which the teaching is proposed.  
  
Even if Honorius' comments in a letter ONLY lead one person (i.e. the person
to whom the letter is addressed) astray, and even if by ""merely"" wrongful
silence, even so the net result is in fact ""the pope leading astray"" one of
the faithful. And, as that letter demonstrates perfectly, no papal letter is

" _Is that swapping of caps problematic on your view?_  
  
No, this is no problem for me: I **expressly said** that if the pope (or any
other bishop) gives a caveat that makes it clear that they ARE NOT intending
their comment to be taken as ""official"" or not as from them qua _teacher_ , it
is not magisterial. (It may have been in the prior post that I said this. Not
sure which one.)  
  
_I'm reading you (maybe) as saying or implying that the assertions of a pope
in faith or morals cannot fail to be 'binding' on any Catholic to some extent,
whether the pope likes it or not; or maybe that this is so, at least by
default._  
  
I am saying that the ""bindingness"" is a matter of degree, just as is the
_intention_ and the _manner in which the intention is expressed_ are
manifestly capable of degree. All commentators agree that there are different
levels of authoritativeness to different kinds of papal documents, from
Apostolic Constitutions through encyclicals and such, down to other actions.
And all agree that the pope can emphasize his teaching with different levels
of formality and different levels of insistence. Just reading through JPII's
encyclicals gives you a wide range of statements he makes that land at widely
different levels of insistence that Catholics be guided by his teaching. It's
not an on/off switch, with nothing in between.  
  
_his 'manifest will' refers especially to his intention to teach and bind the
faithful of the world. Normally he will not express this intention in so many
words, but it can be known 'either from the character of the documents, from
his frequent repetition of the same doctrine, or from his manner of
speaking.'_  
  
These last points, i.e. _markers_ of the pope's intention, clearly are of the
kind that are capable of degree. Especially ""frequent repetition of the same
doctrine"" - if the pope (and the Church) want frequent repetition to be used
as a marker, it is necessarily the case that a teaching pass **_only
gradually_** from ""newly proposed"" to ""long-standing teaching"" by which the
Church expresses ""we're serious about this..."".",2108
" _That said, perhaps in favor of Feser's stance, I think one could say that we
need to accept the judgment of a council on the presumption they got it right,
even if we recognize that in principle it could be corrected later by a proper
authority, We could in fact even adduce evidence for why such a later
correction could be justified._  
  
I admit I might be wrong on this point, but even this seems a little too
strong to me. It is simply a fact that on matters of history - which the
condemnation of Honorius is - it is in no way impious to judge that the
Council was wrong. One should do it respectfully, as the Saints Dr. Feser
references do, but you can absolutely question such judgments. If that were
not so, then Maximos, Bellarmie, and Alphonsus Liguori wouldn't question it.  
  
For example, Trent says that their teaching on indulgences goes back to the
time of the Apostles*. It is not impious to point out that this is a
*historical* claim about indulgences and simply incorrect.

himself, thus 2) Therefore the Magisterium is not protected even from heresy
in its ordinary teachings.  
  
This strikes me as unworkable. One resolution - one Dr. Feser seems to agree
with - is that it was not heresy in the sense Vatican I defined heresy. I
think it is also notable that the Pope did not consult the bishops or address
the Church, so I'm not sure if Vatican I was referring to a Pope's private

"Well, I don't know that I can convince you, but:  
The ""authority to teach"" has always been connected to Christ's ""he who hears

protected _in every sense._ It is pretty odd to think of Christ conveying (to
bishops) an authority to teach _in his name,_ but NOT do anything about
protecting said teachings of those teachers, just the teachings of the pope.
And when the bishops, in their **ordinary** teachings, teach a truth that is
also universally taught by the other bishops, **that** teaching is not only
protected _somewhat_ (i.e. like the kind of protection over those teachings to
which we owe religious submission), those teachings are infallible and we owe
them unreserved assent. So, the bishops in exercising their _ordinary_
teaching office can at least touch on the higher protection, which _suggests_
that they also can touch on the lower protection afforded those teachings to
which we owe religious assent - also in their ordinary exercise of their
teaching office. That is, both acts are acts of their ordinary teaching
office, the difference in the kind of submission we owe being EXTERNAL to the
teaching act itself: it is implausible that we would come to owe UNRESERVED
assent to a teaching of our bishop once we realize that it has universal
agreement of the other bishops, but that _before_ we completed that discovery
that we owed it not even the smallest smidgen of religious submission even
when we have discovered wide agreement of many bishops (but have not yet

"‘It is very common, doubtless, especially in religious controversy, to confuse
infallibility with certitude, and to argue that, since we have not the one, we
have not the other, for that no one can claim to be certain on any point, who
is not infallible about all; but the two words stand for things quite distinct
from each other. For example, I remember for certain what I did yesterday, but
still my memory is not infallible; I am quite clear that two and two makes
four, but I often make mistakes in long addition sums. I have no doubt
whatever that John or Richard is my true friend, but I have before now trusted
those who failed me, and I may do so again before I die.’  
  
‘A certitude is directed to this or that particular proposition; it is not a
faculty or gift, but a disposition of mind relatively to a definite case which
is before me. Infallibility, on the contrary, is just that which certitude is
not; it is a faculty or gift, and relates, not to some one truth in
particular, but to all possible propositions in a given subject-matter. We
ought in strict propriety, to speak, not of infallible acts, but of acts of
infallibility…’  
  
‘A man is infallible, whose words are always true; a rule is infallible, if it
is unerring in all its possible applications. An infallible authority is
certain in every particular case that may arise; but a man who is certain in
some one definite case, is not on that account infallible.’  
  
‘I am quite certain that Victoria is our Sovereign, and not her father, the
late Duke of Kent, without laying any claim to the gift of infallibility; as I
may do a virtuous action, without being impeccable. I may be certain that the
Church is infallible, while I am myself a fallible mortal; otherwise, I cannot
be certain that the Supreme Being is infallible, until I am infallible myself.
It is a strange objection, then, which is sometimes urged against Catholics,
that they cannot prove and assent to the Church's infallibility, unless they
first believe in their own. Certitude, as I have said, is directed to one or
other definite concrete proposition. I am certain of proposition one, two,
three, four, or five, one by one, each by itself. I may be certain of one of
them, without being certain of the rest; that I am certain of the first makes
it neither likely nor unlikely that I am certain of the second; but were I
infallible, then I should be certain, not only of one of them, but of all, and
of many more besides, which have never come before me as yet. Therefore we may
be certain of the infallibility of the Church, while we admit that in many
things we are not, and cannot be, certain at all.’

"I am glad we agree on the subject of heresy, and retract my comment that you
were incorrect on that point.  
  
But your point about the Council still does not stand. They were in fact
making a *historical* claim in judging Honorius guilty of heresy. Councils can
be incorrect about historical claims. You say this:  
  
 _First, the reason a council condemns someone as a heretic is because of his
teaching. Hence it is, first and foremost, Honorius’s teaching that was
condemned. That means that the teaching was judged heretical. But whether a
teaching is heretical is a doctrinal matter, and not a mere historical matter.

follows that the councils in question infallibly judged that Honorius’s
teaching was heretical (whatever his intentions). But since anyone who teaches
heresy is a heretic, it follows (at least given that Honorius really did write
the letters that got him into trouble, as most of his defenders concede) that
these councils did after all infallibly judge that Honorius was a heretic._  
  
This does not follow. The councils judged that *monotheilitism was a heresy*,
which is completely true. They then made the historical claim that *Honorius
was a heretic*, which is not protected by any infallible charism whatsoever.
The key point protected by infallibility is not that Honorius was a heretic;
it's that monothelitism is a heresy. Whether or not Honorius actually taught
monthelitism cannot be established merely by the council's say-so. That simply
is not a doctrinal claim.  
  
You then say this:  
  
 _Second, the reason most of Honorius’s defenders try to defend him is to
avoid having to acknowledge that a pope can teach heresy when not speaking ex
cathedra. Now, suppose that the councils did indeed get it wrong when judging
that Honorius, specifically, was a heretic. Since that is a historical rather
than doctrinal matter, such an error is possible. Still, by making this
judgment, the councils also taught by implication that it is possible for a
pope to teach heresy (when not speaking ex cathedra). And that is a doctrinal
matter. That is enough to refute the larger claim that Honorius’s defenders
are trying to uphold by defending him._  
  
A Pope can speak heresy, potentially; a Pope cannot teach heresy in the
capacity of utilizing his magisterial authority to bind the faithful to
religious assent of will, because then the Magisterium would be leading the
faithful off the path of salvation. And as you happily acknowledge, what the
councils were condemning as heresy is not the understanding that Vatican I
used and is in fact not sinful, because monothelitism had yet to be condemned
directly in a Church council or by an authoritative papal teaching.  
  
Also, I am supremely unconvinced that a private letter can ever be an act of
Magisterial teaching in any case, and not simply the private opinion of the
man who happened to be Pope.  
  
Also you say this:  
  
 _Wright neglects to mention the opinion of St. Francis de Sales, who, when
addressing papal authority in The Catholic Controversy, says that “we do not
say that the Pope cannot err in his private opinions, as did John XXII, or be
altogether a heretic, as perhaps Honorius was” (p. 225)._  
  
Wright ""neglected to mention"" him because St. Francis De Sales is clearly not
condemning Honorius, merely mentioning in passing that he PERHAPS was a
heretic. That's not even commentary, just a brief mention of a controversy.",3522
"(As a side note, and while we’re on the subject of arguments from authority,
let me cite one further authority mentioned by Chapman, St. Maximus the
Confessor. Now, Maximus, to be sure, defended Honorius. However, as Chapman
reports, when Monothelite heretics asked Maximus what he would do _if_ Rome
were to affirm their position, his answer was: “The Holy Ghost anathematizes
even angels, should they command aught beside the faith” (pp. 62-63). Maximus
does _not_ answer that Rome could not possibly do that, or that if Rome did
so, then Monothelitism would have to be accepted. That implies that St.
Maximus allowed that it is possible for the pope to err, at least when not
speaking in a definitive way.)",709

best a matter about which the Church has not decided, and leaves open to the
free debate of theologians. Indeed, as I have argued, it is actually worse

belief was never rejected as an error. We see this in the case of how the
Church viewed cases like Pope John XXII as well. In fact, considering that

"@ Laudator Temporis Acti,  
  
I am breaking down the fairly complex sentence for purposes of analysis.  
  
""Does not this indeterminacy within we who have not yet suffered death mean
that as long as we argue about it, it can never be settled?""  
  
Leaving out the disputed phrase this becomes, ""Does not this indeterminacy
mean that it can never be settled?""  
  
Replacing the disputed phrase, with a single word object for the preposition,
this becomes, ""Does not this indeterminacy WITHIN SOME mean that it can never
be settled?""  
  
SOME = ""We who have not yet suffered death""  
  
This is a noun clause. It is the object of the preposition ""within"". It is a
dependent clause and must exist in some relation with the rest of the
sentence. It cannot stand alone as an independent sentence. The preposition
""within"" connects this dependent clause with the sentence. The entire clause
is the object of the preposition. Otherwise the rest of the clause, ""who have
not yet suffered death"", would be standing alone with no connection to the
sentence.  
  
Let us look at the clause in isolation by making it independent.  
  
""We, who have not yet suffered death, pause.""  
  
""Us, who have not yet suffered death, pause""  
  
You choose.  
  
""We pause"" or ""Us pause"" or perhaps ""Us paused"".

but I would still write it the way I did.  
  
I have a very interesting book on the relation between English and Latin
called ""English Grammar for Students of Latin"" by Norma W. Goldman. It does
not teach Latin grammar from English grammar or vice versa"". It helps to teach
Latin Grammar by showing how it is similar to and how it differs from English
grammar. One thing is immediately obvious in it; you do not get correct
English grammar by applying the rules of Latin grammar to English. In fact,
English is fundamentally a Germanic language with a large element of the
Romance languages admixed.  
  
It is true, however, that teachers and other English stylists have long tried
to make English follow Latin in grammatical style, something that seems
overwrought to me. I don't think this is as common as it was once.

"My words were sinful but not empty this time. In ""...within us who have..."",
the preposition governs ""us"" in the accusative, which is followed by a sub-
clause headed by a relative pronoun in the nominative. Here's an example in
Latin from Peter Abelard (I'm not a Latin scholar, but did it at school long
ago):  
  
Inter nos, qui hoc recipimus... Among us, who have received this...  
  
http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/abelard/dialogus.html  
  
Nos is accusative, qui is nominative. I know English isn't Latin, but standard
literary English follows the same rule.  
  
However, the ""whoever"" is correct here:  
  
* They fight against us who have the Light, for they fight against whoever hath the Light.  
  
The first preposition governs a pronoun followed by a sub-clause, the second
preposition governs an entire clause headed by ""whoever"". Many folk would
think it's ""whomever.""",886
"@ Ed,  
  
I had thought that the Church, with its popes, church men, and councils, was
the Body of Christ and He was its Head. Was not Honorius receiving absolution
in confession during his papacy? If so, what is the big deal? If Councils and
popes condemned him as a heretic and to harsh punishment what does that mean?
That he goes to Hell?  
  
Why not Purgatory with the meaning of ""harsh"", or whatever words were used,
being indeterminate in absolute meaning? At his death, action would have been
out of the Hands of the Body and beyond Its reach and, as the action of the
infinite God, beyond Its absolute understanding.  
  
Are the matters of this dispute not indeterminate as matters of human
understanding within the Church militant? Does not this indeterminacy within
we who have not yet suffered death mean that as long as we argue about it, it
can never be settled? Is that not why the argument goes on and on?  
  
If so, what is the big deal? Let the issue be settled by the increasing
distance of time. Let the scholars who insist on digging up the corpse of this
affair have their fun with it and let the rest of us forget it. The scholars
cannot settle it and should not be able to settle it. Only time can settle it.

Tom Cohoe  ",1262
"I'm going to push back on another point that you make here, Dr. Feser. I am
not convinced these letters by Honorius are acts of the Magisterium. You make
the case here:  
  
_But it is not true to say (as some have in Honorius’s defense) that he was
merely speaking as a private theologian. He was doing no such thing. Sergius
wrote to him seeking the authoritative advice of the bishop of Rome, and
Honorius responded in that capacity._  
  
Okay, let's look at it like this. When Pope Francis is being asked for quotes
about theological matters, they are not interviewing him because he's a
regular guy. They are interviewing him because he's the Pope. The only reason
they are about his opinion is that he is the Pope. When he gives his response,
it is as the Pope, sometimes on a subject of faith and morals. Is this an
authoritative teaching? If the Pope wrote his response down would it be?",896
"Also,  
  
 _How is it possible to be an consecrated a bishop and then teach but not
teach under the auspices of your being a bishop, i.e. ""teacher""?_  
  
Quite easily, I should imagine. If I am a teacher, and a student asks me a
question outside of class and I answer him in a private email, I am teaching
but not in my official capacity as a teacher. I see no reason being a Bishop
changes this basic concept of official vs. unofficial teaching capacity.",457
" _The fact that it is private is irrelevant to whether he is teaching, and to
whether he intends the recipient to receiving this and be guided by it._  
  
It is certainly very relevant when discussing if anybody should be bound to
this teaching or whether he is writing a simple advice letter.",294
"The central issue though is that if you concede that the Catholic Church held
it possible that a Pope can err outside of his infallible pronouncements, it
becomes less important whether Honorius is an actual example of this
possibility. For even if he were not an example and the council had merely
operated on limited information on his writings and context, it still remains
true that a Pope can err. Perhaps more importantly, it remains true that the
more recent notion that a Pope can never err is foreign to the Catholic faith.
As it happens, the case of Honorius is mostly discussed today in the context
of this matter.  
  
As for your comment on piety, once again, it is of less importance whether the
council actually erred. All one needs to establish is that Catholics held it
possible that a Pope could err.",818
"Now, one point that some readers have made is that the word “heresy” was used
in a more expansive way earlier in Church history than it is today. That is
correct and important, and it is something [I have elsewhere emphasized
myself](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2019/05/popes-heresy-and-papal-
heresy.html). In modern canon law, heresy is “the obstinate denial or
obstinate doubt after the reception of baptism of some truth which is to be
believed by divine and Catholic faith.” Pope Honorius was definitely _not_ a
heretic in that sense, both because there is no evidence of obstinacy on his
part, and because a charitable reading of his problematic statements supports
the judgment that he did not intend to undermine traditional teaching (even if
his words inadvertently had that effect). There are also the related points
that one could be a heretic in the _material_ sense of affirming something
doctrinally erroneous, while not being a _formal_ heretic in the sense of
persisting in the error even after being warned by ecclesiastical authority;
and that whether some doctrine has actually been defined by the Church is
relevant to whether it is “to be believed by divine and Catholic faith.”",1204
"For these reasons, I prefer to use the more general and less potentially
misleading term “error” when discussing the case of Honorius, as I did in the
title of my previous post. All the same, the Sixth Ecumenical Council does
apply the term “heretic” to Honorius, and “heresy” in those days implied at
the very least _positive doctrinal error_ (as opposed, say, to mere negligence
or a _failure to counter_ doctrinal error). In other words, by labeling
Honorius a heretic, the council was accusing him of teaching false doctrine.
The question on the table is whether he can be defended against this charge.",606
"How is it possible to be an consecrated a bishop and then teach but not teach
under the auspices of your being a bishop, i.e. ""teacher""? If you are made a
teacher, and you teach, you are exercising your ""teacher"" role.  
  
But the _bindingness_ of bishops' teachings varies in degree, according to the
manner in which they propose them to us ""to be held"". Some they assert with
great force and definitude, with explicit reference to this being something
taught by the Church from time immemorial. Others they teach less definitely,
but still ""with authority"". Others again they teach very mildly, but still as
something they want us to accept. These are all _teachings_ and therefore they
must be received by us, _in accord with the MANNER in which they were proposed
to be received._ There are infinitely many degrees in which their teachings
require assent from us, as is the infinitely many degrees of the teachings
being taught with an expectation of being received.  
  
It is when a bishop, either by venue, by context, or by clear mention,
indicates that he is merely speculating or indulging in pious but uncertain
considerations, that he is not asking for our assent as such. When he says
things like ""well, _it seems to me_ "", or ""in my personal opinion,"" or ""I feel
that X, but others may feel differently"" he is indicating room for dissent by
others.  
  
But note also that the venue is not WHOLLY determinative: in an encyclical, a
pope might state a new idea that is his own personal view but is still
uncertain, and also re-state a time-honored and universally approved teaching.
The fact that the venue is _capable_ of teaching high and _strongly_
authoritative statements (and is the normal venue for doing so) does not mean
every word in the encyclical bears that degree. Just as not every word of an
ecumenical council consists in an infallible dogmatic decree, even though a
council is capable of that.",1924
" _So you're not infallible when you claim that the Magisterium and Pope are
infallible?_  
  
You lost me here. Of course I am not. Yes, it is true that eventually
fallibility is introduced into the equation. The difference is that *IF* my
claim is right there is then a point when infallibility is introduced, which
is never the case normally.",344

"Second, the reason most of Honorius’s defenders try to defend him is to avoid
having to acknowledge that a pope can teach heresy when not speaking _ex
cathedra_. Now, suppose that the councils did indeed get it wrong when judging
that Honorius, specifically, was a heretic. Since that is a historical rather
than doctrinal matter, such an error is possible. Still, by making this
judgment, the councils also taught by implication that _it is possible for a
pope to teach heresy_ (when not speaking _ex cathedra_ ). And _that is_ a
doctrinal matter. That is enough to refute the larger claim that Honorius’s

"My recent article on [the error and condemnation of Pope
Honorius](http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2022/10/the-error-and-condemnation-
of-pope.html) has gotten a lot of feedback both here and at Twitter (much of
the latter surprisingly civil and constructive for that venue). Because of the
historical and theological complexities of the topic, several issues have
arisen, but the main one I want to address here is the question of whether
Honorius can plausibly be defended from the charge of heresy that the Sixth
Ecumenical Council leveled against him. Keep in mind that what is at issue
here is _not_ whether Honorius taught heresy while issuing a purported _ex
cathedra_ definition. He was certainly not doing that, which is why the case
of Honorius is irrelevant to whether popes are infallible when they _do_ teach
_ex cathedra_ (which is all that the First Vatican Council taught in its
decree on papal infallibility). What is at issue is whether Honorius taught
heresy when _not_ speaking _ex cathedra_ – and, more generally, whether any
pope could in principle do so.",1077
"Needless to say, what Honorius actually said in his letters to Sergius is
relevant to this question. But it is not the only thing that is relevant. The
chief obstacle to acquitting Honorius of the charge of positively teaching
doctrinal error (however inadvertently) is that, as I showed in my previous
article, _two papally-approved councils of the Church explicitly said that he
did_. In particular, the Sixth Ecumenical Council explicitly labeled him a
“heretic.” And the Seventh Ecumenical Council explicitly condemns “ **the
doctrine of one will held by** Sergius, **Honorius** , Cyrus, and Pyrrhus.”",605
"In support of your point, can we say that one essential factor differentiating
magisterial and non-magisterial acts is the manifested will of a bishop to
bind to obedience the faithful under his authority to adhere (at least in some
degree) to a particular teaching?  
  
Vatican II said of the Ordinary Magisterium, 'In matters of faith and morals,
the bishops speak in the name of Christ and the faithful are to accept their
teaching and adhere to it with a religious assent. This religious submission
of mind and will must be shown in a special way to the authentic magisterium
of the Roman Pontiff, even when he is not speaking ex cathedra; that is, it
must be shown in such a way that his supreme magisterium is acknowledged with
reverence, the judgments made by him are sincerely adhered to, according to
his manifest mind and will. His mind and will in the matter may be known
either from the character of the documents, from his frequent repetition of
the same doctrine, or from his manner of speaking.' (Lumen Gentium 25)  
  
As with Vatican I's dogma of papal infallibility, I would think that this is
intended by Vatican II as a description to be also applied retrospectively,
even if in the 7th century they were not yet thinking about it in these
explicit terms.  
  
The 'manifest mind' of a pope refers especially to the doctrinal content of a
document; his 'manifest will' refers especially to his intention to teach and
bind the faithful of the world. Normally he will not express this intention in
so many words, but it can be known 'either from the character of the
documents, from his frequent repetition of the same doctrine, or from his
manner of speaking.'  
  
But as a minimum, the intention to somehow bind the faithful of the world
would require the intention to promulgate the teaching to the faithful of the
world (not just sending a letter to one individual, leaving it to his choice
and initiative to promulgate to the world as he saw fit).  
  
The Holy See these days generally publishes a papal teaching document
(including letters to individuals or groups) in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis if
the pope's intention had been to promulgate that document to all the faithful
- thus confirming that it has at least some level of magisterial authority.  
  
Was it the intention of Pope Honorius that his letters to Patriarch Sergius be
promulgated to the Catholic world as binding (albeit non-definitive) teaching?
It does not appear so, and the condemnations of Honorius by the Ecumenical
Councils do not require us to think this either.  
  
Just as his letters do not fall within Vatican I's description of the papal
Extraordinary Magisterium, neither, apparently, do they fall within Vatican
II's description of the papal Ordinary Magisterium. And therefore, neither do
they provide a precedent showing that a teaching of the papal Ordinary
Magisterium can be not merely in error, but heretical.",2927
"@Laudator Temporis Acti  
  
There is nothing about your objection that logically limits its application to
matters of religion - if it were valid, it would remove the possibility of
objective certainty in any field of knowledge, since any assertion we made
would always require the implicit qualification, 'But since I am fallible, I
could be wrong about this' (even about e.g. 2+2=4).  
  
I'll mention in passing - the objection, thus taken to its logical conclusion,
would therefore appear to be self-refuting, because the objector puts forward
the objection itself as objectively certain truth (not qualifying it as
'merely probable').  
  
But be that as it may, I will try to show that (whether or not its conclusion
is self-refuting) the objection is a logical fallacy.  
  
This is its basic structure:  
  
It is possible for beliefs of mine to be false.  
X is a belief of mine.  
Therefore it is possible that X is false.  
  
Consider the parallel argument:  
  
It is possible for cats to be black.  
Fluffy is a cat.  
Therefore it is possible that Fluffy is black [even though I can see she is
white].  
  
The reason that these arguments fail is that I can be aware of more about
Fluffy than the fact that she is a cat, and I can be aware of more about 'X'
than the fact that it is a belief of mine. If all we knew about Fluffy was
that she was a cat, then it would be reasonable to say that it was possible
that she was black. And if all we knew about X was that it was a belief of my
fallible self, then it would be reasonable to say that X was possibly false.  
  
But in fact, I can know from the evidence of my senses that in Fluffy's case,
the abstract possibility for cats to be black is not fulfilled in her
particular case. And I can know from direct knowledge of conclusive logical or
factual evidence in the particular case of X (e.g. 2+2=4), that the abstract
general possibility of my beliefs being false is not fulfilled in the
particular case of my belief X.  
  
This is why the general fallibility that is ours as humans does not prove the
impossibility of individuals reaching valid objective certainty in particular
cases, where the individual is aware of sufficient evidence for the belief.  
  
So there is no reason in principle why an individual, although fallible, might
not discover sufficient evidence to ground a valid objective certainty
(absolute certainty or reasonable moral certainty as the case may be) that
e.g. '2+2=4', or 'The theory of relativity is true', or 'God has promised to
protect from error a whole class of statements made by the pope in certain
fairly well-defined circumstances'. One would need to examine the purported
evidence in each case, but there is no reason in principle that it could not
exist, despite our fallibility.

"I once had reason to write to my bishop about a matter of faith that needed
clarification. His private, written response, delivered through his staff
theologian, constituted _for me_ an expression of his will to teach me in a
certain way, and his will that I accept his teaching. That it was a private
letter indicated _how broadly_ he intended his instruction to bind people, but
it did not detract from _whether_ he intended that I give his instruction my
assent. I could have _simply ignored_ his instructions ONLY by ignoring the
obligation to give religious submission to the teachings of the successors to
the Apostles, to whom Christ said ""he who hears you hears me"". The _manner_ of
my assent, i.e. the reserved assent proper to ""religious submission"" depends
quite definitely on the _nature of the reservations_ by which it falls short
of UNreserved assent, and this too owes its proper determination to the
_intention of the bishop_ , as to the manner and degree by which he intends to
bind his subordinate(s). And this he conveys in the very same manner as
indicated in the quoted passage from Vatican II below,

most hostile critic, and yet all that he can bring himself to say is that
certain passages are ‘difficult to account for.’” As we’ve just seen, though,
that is far from the truth. Again, in his book Chapman goes so far as to say
that “unquestionably no Catholic has the right to deny that Honorius was a
heretic”; and in his _Catholic Encyclopedia_ article on Honorius, he says that
“it is clear that no Catholic has the right to defend Pope Honorius.  He was a
heretic, not in intention, but in fact.” Oddly, Wright does not quote these

limited infallibility, which is another way of saying fallibility. To put it

certainly condemned as a heretic just as Sergius was, and so on) and then

juridical declarations of councils are not infallible, and thus in theory

need to accept the judgment of a council on the presumption they got it right,
even if we recognize that in principle it could be corrected later by a proper
authority, We could in fact even adduce evidence for why such a later
correction could be justified. BUT, to be safe, I don't think we would want to
take that evidence and determine for ourselves that the judgment was wrong, or
certainly declare such to others. I think we COULD, however, make a case that
we see how such an argument could be made, even if we accept the conclusions

"St. Alphonsus concludes that the only plausible defense of Honorius is to
argue that he was not himself a Monothelite heretic, while nevertheless
conceding that he was justly condemned “as a favourer of heretics, and for his
negligence in repressing error” and for “using ambiguous words to please and
keep on terms with heretics” (p. 187). That is very close to Chapman’s view
that Honorius can justly be accused of heresy given Felix III’s dictum that
“an error which is not resisted is approved; a truth which is not defended is
suppressed” – even if St. Alphonsus himself stops short of that conclusion.",607
"Let’s note also at the outset that the issue here is _not_ whether Catholics
are ordinarily obligated to assent to papal teaching even when it is not put
forward infallibly. The answer is that they _are_ ordinarily obligated. More
precisely, they owe even non-definitive papal teaching what is called
“religious assent,” which is not the unqualified assent owed to teaching put
forward infallibly, but is nevertheless firm. To be even more precise, there
is a very strong _presumption_ in favor of such assent, though the Church, in
documents like _Donum Veritatis_ , has acknowledged that there can be rare
cases in which this presumption is overridden and a faithful Catholic at
liberty respectfully to raise questions about some magisterial statement. The
clearest sort of case would be one where a magisterial statement appears to
conflict with past definitive teaching. I’ve discussed this issue in detail
[elsewhere](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2018/05/the-church-permits-
criticism-of-popes_20.html).",1012
"Second, as noted by John Chapman (whose book on Honorius I discussed in my
previous post), the Church has long held that “an error which is not resisted
is approved; a truth which is not defended is suppressed” (in the words of
Honorius’s predecessor Pope Felix III). It is possible to be guilty of
teaching doctrinal error by implication, when the context demands that a
certain truth needs to be explicitly affirmed and instead one not only fails
to do so but speaks in an ambiguous way that gives the appearance of approving
the error. And that is exactly what Honorius did. The Monothelite error was
being put forward, and he not only did not clearly condemn it but _seemed_ to
be saying that it could be accepted. The suggestion that his words can be
given a more charitable reading (as I agree they can) is relevant to his
personal culpability, but it is not relevant to the question of the doctrinal
soundness of the words themselves, and as Chapman emphasizes, in a context
like this it is the words that matter.",1020
"@Tony  
  
In Benedict XVI's Foreword to his book 'Jesus of Nazareth' published during
his pontificate, he wrote, 'It goes without saying that this book is in no way
an exercise of the magisterium, but is solely an expression of my personal
search for the face of the Lord. Everyone is free, then, to contradict me. I
would only ask my readers for that initial goodwill without which there can be
no understanding.' (It was understood by everyone as being written in his
capacity 'as a private theologian'.)  
  
The book had a certain impact around the world of Catholic thought, as he no
doubt wished - partly caused by his pre-existing reputation as a theologian,
but certainly added to by the simple fact that he was now pope. He wanted to
'teach' people, in a similar way to us wanting to 'teach' each other by
posting on this blog - hopefully our motive is that we want to help one
another on the path to truth. And he wanted to use his new platform as pope to
reach a wider audience.  
  
However, Benedict didn't want Catholics to consider themselves morally bound
to accept what he said, just from the mere fact of who it was that said it. I
don't think that this was particularly because he was tentative or uncertain
about his statements in the book - maybe for some of them he was, others he
wasn't. But rather, he wanted in this case to leave acceptance of what he was
saying simply up to the free consideration of the individual. He didn't wish
to 'bind' anyone.  
  
So, he took off his 'pope' cap and put on his 'private theologian' cap, saying
that his writing was solely an expression of his 'personal search for the face
of the Lord' (despite presumably being motivated by wanting others to learn
from his words and to be influenced by them).  
  
Is that swapping of caps problematic on your view? I'm reading you (maybe) as
saying or implying that the assertions of a pope in faith or morals cannot
fail to be 'binding' on any Catholic to some extent, whether the pope likes it
or not; or maybe that this is so, at least by default. That is (maybe unless
the pope explicitly says otherwise, as with Benedict's book), Catholics should
consider themselves morally bound to adhere (at least to some degree) to a
pope's assertions in faith or morals, merely from the fact of who it is that
is asserting them. This would be whether or not they are published in an
official document, and whether or not they are promulgated to the whole
Church: it is all 'teaching', and by a representative of Christ, and therefore
magisterial.  
  
So on this view, the official but private replies of Pope Honorius to
Patriarch Sergius would be 'binding' to some extent on any Catholic who learnt
of them and their contents.  
  
And the plane interviews of Pope Francis would be to some small degree
magisterial (if they concern faith or morals) - calling for our acceptance of
his statements from the mere fact of who it is that is speaking and
'teaching'.  
  
Am I misreading you?

You may be agreeing with me. Bishops individually can teach heresy; the

"I feel that the key point is the fact, as you mentioned, that even if one
succeeds in defending Honorius, it still remains true that the Church has
always believed it possible that a Pope can err when acting outside of the
boundaries of infallibility. So anyone who wishes to defend Honorius, which
usually tends to be the Sedevecantist or Ultramontanist types, can never
accomplish their goal. If they were to deny that the Church held the teaching,
then they must concede that Popes who tacitly implied/promoted and approved of
the belief that a Pope might err, had actually erred. Thus, their position is
undermined and cannot ever be salvaged.",647

should say is: I feel certain of X, but I could be wrong.  
  
But if he'd said that, his argument collapses. He fails to distinguish between
the subjective feeling of certainty and the objective possession of certainty.
Alas for us humans, all we can ever be sure we have is the first. In my
subjective opinion. And those who disagree with me do not agree with each
other: Catholics are certain about X being true and Y being false, Muslims are
certain about X being false and Y being true, etc. Plus, Catholics disagree

" _1) Yes it was an act of the Magisterium, even from the Pope himself, thus 2)
Therefore the Magisterium is not protected even from heresy in its ordinary
teachings._  
  
What, specifically, makes you phrase the second as ""not protected from
_heresy_?""  
  
We know that the Church's fallible teachings (I.e. those which were not taught
infallibly) are ""not **absolutely** protected"" from ERROR, in that fallible
teachings are reformable and might eventually be reformed because they were
wrong and needed to be corrected.  
  
But one cannot conclude from this that the Church's fallible teachings are
therefore _utterly_ not protected from error, i.e. that there is simply
NOTHING that limits how much error they have. That doesn't follow. As I
understand it, the Church says of these teachings that they, too, are
influenced by the Holy Spirit, in a lesser way, such that the Church will not
fall into such error (on non-infallible teachings) that she _lastingly_ leads
Christians into grave error that endangers their souls. These criteria are
inherently difficult to apply to particular cases, but the basic _idea_ is
that, like situation where the Holy Spirit's action by which He molds the
teachings of the many bishops so that they (without formal collusion) all
teach the same thing so that it becomes an infallible teaching, so also at
other times He molds their teaching so that where one or some are in error,
others are not, or at least not gravely and for long. This is indeed a
protection, afforded to _the Church_ , that does not protect from every error,
rather from an error having a certain scale of effect.  
  
Clearly the Arian heresy running rampant was an error _in the ranks of
bishops_ so that they were teaching error, but it never swallowed the entire
episcopate. Since it is simply the case that the bishops who were Arians were
teaching _wrongly_ by their _officially demanding_ belief in Arianism, and
since the bishops certainly exercise their magisterial office when they teach
in an official capacity in such wise as to insist on and require assent, we
know that ""the Magisterium can teach error"" _in at least that limited sense_ ,
don't we?",2176
"By the way, I'd like to note I am not making an ultramontanist or
sedevacantist argument. My point is not that the Magisterium can never err
doctrinally. My point is that the Magisterium is protected by the Holy Spirit
from moving believers off the path of salvation. This includes all of the
post-Vatican II popes as well as Honorius. Thus while I accept that Honorius
*might* have made a doctrinal error, that error would not lead anyone off the
path of salvation since it was not yet an error on a teaching infallibly
defined by the Church and thus it would not have been sinful at the time to
share the Pope's (possible) opinion.",633
"Well, sure, when you are ""on the clock"" for being paid, you are a teacher, and
when you are ""off the clock"" you can act in other capacities.  
  
I would note three things: (1) if you are writing the email in response to a
question he raises in relation to the very subject you have been hired as a
teacher, and if your answer gives him information relating to the subject
about which you were hired as a teacher, you ARE acting ""as a teacher"". (2) a
bishop is _never_ ""off the clock"". Consequently, (3) if he is writing a
private letter to one of his flock on a matter of faith and morals, and he is
intending that his letter _guide_ that member of his flock, he IS being a
teacher. The fact that it is private is _irrelevant_ to whether he is
teaching, and to whether he _intends_ the recipient to receiving this and be
guided by it.",835
"Let me put my point about the Council's condemnation this way. If a Church
Council condemned him in such a way we should regard it as infallible, what on
earth were Bellarmie, Alphonsus, and Maximos doing defending him? Surely if
they thought it was an infallible teaching of a Council they actually should
have done the opposite! Obviously they did not think it infallibly taught that
Honorius was a heretic and the matter was at least up for debate.",451
"_[I]t is very hard to believe that all the Fathers, not alone of this Council,
but also of the Seventh and Eighth General Councils, who also condemned
Honorius, were in error, in condemning his doctrine_. (p. 186)",213
"Implying that a Pope can teach heresy when not speaking ex cathedra - simply
because Vatican I defined that ex cathedra statements cannot be heretical -
seems a classic logical flaw of making the conclusion broader than the
premises.  
  
The Seventh Oecumenical Council could not evaluate the writings of Pope
Honorius as heretical, not only because they weren’t, but because there was no
discussion of these writings. If it accepted the history that Honorius was a
heretic, it got it wrong.  
  
Vatican I, which left nothing to implication, explained how we ought to
interpret its deliberations. Because it defined that all the Popes had
“unfailing faith”, the expressions contained in the deliberations of the
Seventh Oecumenical Council should be understood as the censure of the
extremely negligent behaviour that it was; the term heretic was not as
specific then as it later would be. The sense of Vatican I in defining Papal
infallibility is obvious; it is prefaced with Christ’s prayer that Peter’s
faith would not fail, not merely that he might speak infallibly one a century.
Rather than put a strict modern theological understanding of the term heresy
into the mouths of prelates in ancient times, we need to apply the modern
Church understanding of the Papacy; there is no getting around this.  
  
Whether or not one can be accused of being a heretic for “not resisting an
error” and “not defending the truth, one is NOT a heretic because of those
things; Pope Felix III, cited in the post, has just explained how to view
quite possible uses (which do not convey the understanding of a heretical Pope
as we discuss it) of the term heretic in his times!  
  
The bottom line is that, even if “the Pope cannot be heretical when not
speaking ex cathedra” were reduced to an opinion that is not probable, this
would not translate into meaning the contrary opinion is probable. Such a view
still needs to be substantiated, something very far from view.  ",1963

"It seems to me that before Vatican I, the Church was well aware of the matter
of teachings that were binding _in some strong sense_ even without a dogmatic
decree by a Council. One of the indicators of this is, expressly, the Church's
willingness to categorize someone as ""a heretic"" (and not just condemn their
teaching) on the basis of not merely that their idea is erroneous, but that
_they should have KNOWN better_ , and thus their holding such ideas is
_morally_ faulty as well as intellectually faulty. Certainly, the fact that
something had been already _taught universally by the Fathers_ was considered
sufficient evidence of its bona fides, without either a council or a papal
declaration, and indeed its unanimous affirmation by the Fathers _was USED by
the Councils_ as the basis for their dogmatic definitions. But at the same
time, there were many other teachings that were neither dogmatically defined,
nor contested / disputed, that were simply _passed along_ from generation to
generation as being ""what had been taught"" and everybody assented to them and
nobody got worked up about whether they were held definitively and
irreformably or just, you know, the ordinary teachings of the Church.  
  
The distinction between teachings that have been affirmed by the Church in a
way that demands assent without reservation, and teachings that have been
affirmed in a way that requires assent that can still be with reservation, has
been _implicitly_ present from the beginning. People had been implicitly using
that implicit distinction all along.",1561

Some have tried to show how Honorius’s words can be read in an orthodox way,
but as Chapman and Butler emphasize, this misses the point that the question
of whether Honorius was a heretic cannot be settled by reference to his
letters alone. The fact that _councils and later_ _popes themselves_ have
denounced him as a heretic is also crucial, for to deny that he was a heretic
is thereby to challenge the judgment of these councils and popes. To show that
Honorius did not err, but at the cost of showing that these later popes and
(papally approved) councils _did_ err, would be a Pyrrhic victory.",824

it's possible that one may get a Pope who is orthodox in all respects except
for the death penalty where he is inspired by NNLT.

"A helpful and informative discussion. I will break up my reflection in
multiple posts, since what I have to say is too long for a single comment.  
  
One point I see consistently unmentioned in various assessments of Honorius I
have read online over the years, though, is the importance of the distinction
between formal and material heresy. I do not know when this distinction came
to be (ahem) formally recognized in Catholic thought, but I suspect it was
after the period of Honorius.  
  
What is significant in this in respect to the later Vatican I's declaration of
papal primacy of jurisdiction is that the Pope himself is the final court of
appeal. Hence, in many cases someone might not be aware of their heresy, and
hold it materially but not formally (insofar as they are not consciously and
obstinately asserting a view contrary to the teaching of the Church, as made
clear to them by the ecclesial authorities). In other words, it is ultimately
up the ecclesial authorities, and ultimately via appeal to the Pope himself,
to declare a view heretical.  
  
It seems that it is only at that point that one who continues to hold the
problematic view can be definitively called a formal heretic (such would apply
earlier, of course, if the person himself acknowledged his view was heretical,
but said he did not care, etc.). But in the case of one who does not consider
his view heretical, it would require ecclesial judgment, and even this could
be overridden by the Pope via appeal. That would be the final say, at least in
that Pope's lifetime (another wrinkle in the case of Honorius, on which i'll
comment more in a moment).

"Many contemporary readers with only a superficial knowledge of the history and
theology of the papacy are bound to find shocking the details of the case of
Honorius as recounted by writers like Chapman and Butler. They might expect to
hear such things only from either theological liberals keen to subvert the
authority of the papacy, or radical traditionalists looking for precedents for
accusing recent popes of heresy. But Chapman and Butler were perfectly
mainstream orthodox Catholic academics of the day, whose work was in no way
considered scandalous.  They were writing long before the debates over
liberalism and traditionalism that arose after Vatican II, so that they cannot
be accused of having any ax to grind in those debates.",740

philosophers/academics (Dr Matthew Levering, Dr Chris Kaczor, Dr Scott Hahn ,
Dr Michael Patrick Barber, Dr Jennifer Frey, Dr Robert P George etc) and
analyse their public statements , you would probably find that Prof Feser has
been the most critical and open about his reservations with regards to this
papacy.  
  
As for negativity, the very reason why there has been an increase of posts on

committing heresy, hence the urgency to show that it is possible for a Pope to

pray that the Holy Spirit grant Pope Francis sound wisdom.

accuse Honorius only of aiding and abetting heresy rather than condemning him

seem to think this absolves Honorius of the charge of heresy. But there are
several problems with this move. First, as Chapman notes, in one respect Leo’s
statement is _harsher_ than the council’s, not less harsh. For Leo goes so far
as to accuse his predecessor of _polluting the purity of the Roman See itself_
, which the council had not done. Second, Leo did confirm the council, and
thereby lent authority to its decrees. And those decrees explicitly condemn
Honorius as a heretic. Third, the later councils, as well as the later papal
oath, reaffirmed Honorius’s anathematization.",816

great foe of modernism and upholder of the authority of the papacy. In fact,

infallibility. And yet for all that, Chapman does not shrink from the judgment
that the historical facts show that “no Catholic has the right to deny that
Honorius was a heretic” (p. 116). The reason he could say this is that the
error Honorius was guilty of did not occur in the context of an _ex cathedra_
definition. And thus Chapman’s judgement is perfectly within the bounds of
what everyone acknowledged to be the orthodox understanding of the papacy even

logical substrate producing all the virtual simulations.  
  
So in tomorrow's representation, when the new subsequence comes into play,
whenever the question of prime or composite concerning 127 or 128 arises, the
subsequence that is the virtual reality program now also runs the sub-sub-
sequence that was missing in the part of the program representing times
heretofore. The new stuff just adds 1 to 128 or 127, calculates whether the
sum is prime or a power of 2 using the old rules, and pops out the new answer
for the numbers before the addition was made.  
  
Voila, 127 is a power of 2 and 128 is a prime number.  
  
Heh-heh-heh!  
  
That's all I have time for today. This gives you time to cook up another
fallibility argument and make more angry and disdainful responses before I

So why believe Chapman over Bellarmine?  
  
Seems the problem is the term ""heresy"" has undergone a development over the
past 2000 years. The Greek term literally means to break off from the whole.
In it's early use simply not following the discipline of the Church made you a
heretic (where as in later times we would call you a mere schismatic). Thought
in later times it is narrowly defined to refer to professing a false &
formally condemned doctrinal proposition.  
  
Allowing heresy to be taught or failing to condemn it can get you labelled a
""heretic"" even if you do not hold to any formal doctrinal or moral errors.  
  
Also I think condemning anybody as a heretic is an act of discipline not faith
and morals. I don't think the Catholic Church has the power to infallibly say
Nestorius was a heretic. But she can infallibly say Nestorianism (the false
view Christ is two persons, one divine and one human attributed to Nestorius)
is heresy.  
  
Which is why you can in theory rehabilitate a heretic. You don't know their
subjective intent with any certainty. But you can know a given doctrinal
proposition is false when the Church has clearly condemned it.  
  
With that in mind Prof Feser I don't think rehabilitating Honorius is a
Pyrrhic victory.  
  
  
  ",1289
"(continued from previous post)  
  
So, in the case of Honorius, we see this distinction between formal and
material heresy is not made, and the question of whether it could have been
formally heretical is challenged by the fact that in his own lifetime (at
least while holding the Chair), Honorius himself would have been the final
court of appeal. Assuredly he would not have taken his own view to be
heretical. So right there there seems to be a strong reason to declare he was
at least not a FORMAL heretic. But this takes us to the question of the
authority of FUTURE councils and Popes. Many questions arise.  
  
First, it seems to me that while current popes have primacy of jurisdiction,
and infallibility in ex cathedra teaching, their juridical judgments are not
infallible (leaving aside the issue of the infallibility of canonizations of
saints). But of course, in their time no one would have the authority to
ignore or override a Pope's juridical judgment. Vatican I makes this much
clear. BUT, could such a person still believe, privately or publicly, that a
current pope's judgment was wrong, even while admitting that neither he (that
person himself) nor anyone other than the Pope could juridically do anything
about this? It seems this would be the case, though it would also be within
the Pope's power to discipline such a person.  
  
So, it does seem possible that a Pope could wrongly judge that someone was not
in heresy, or that the person was heretical, but juridically that judgment
would still have to be honored, since the current Pope would have the final
say in such matters. (to be continued)  
  ",1630
"Whether or not the later popes and councils made an error about the details of
Honorius' actual stance, their behavior demonstrates that THEY thought (and
taught) that a pope could hold error and teach it. And...if _they were WRONG_
in thinking so...that still proves the point.",278
" _And if, in that context, he teaches something contrary to the traditional
teaching of the Church, he will fall into error – and may thereby lead others
into error as well, with catastrophic consequences for the Church. But the
Church will in such a situation nevertheless right herself before long, and
will come to judge harshly any pope who fomented such a crisis._

overall harsh tone of the article especially the ending where in it seems like
some of kind of coping mechanism, which more or less translates to ""The going
is tough boys, but here is something you can look forward to that will
strengthen your faith, the punishment and harsh judgement of those sinners
(Followed by Loud Cheers).""  
  
Why can't we just take a more positive route and pray for the conversion and
change of those who we don't think are on the right path, why must we depend
on looking forward to some fantasized harsh judgement and punishment of those
who have lost their way so that our faith is not shaken.  
  
To quote Pope Benedict XVI from God is With Us from the chapter God’s Yes and
His Love Are Maintained Even in Death  
  
""The very heart of the faith has been lost to anyone who supposes that it is
only worthwhile, if it is, so to say, made worthwhile by the damnation of
others. Such a way of thinking, which finds the punishment of other people
necessary, springs from not having inwardly accepted the faith; from loving
only oneself and not God the Creator, to whom his creatures belong. That way
of thinking would be like the attitude of those people who could not bear the
workers who came last being paid a denarius like the rest; like the attitude
of people who feel properly rewarded only if others have received less. This
would be the attitude of the son who stayed at home, who could not bear the
reconciling kindness of his father. It would be a hardening of our hearts, in
which it would become clear that we were only looking out for ourselves and
not looking for God; in which it would be clear that we did not love our
faith, but merely bore it like a burden.""  
  
End quote  
  
To forestall some usual tired objections, obviously this doesn't deny the
reality of hell or the reality that some human beings will go to hell or the
reality of punishment. These Truths are obvious from Christ's clear words
where he says ""Many will not be Able"". (Although on the question of relative
numbers and percentages, I am inclined to agree with Cardinal Avery Dulles
where he mentioned that God hasn't provided any such stats or figures like
more then 50% etc. Those who interpret the narrow path and wide path in that
way are free to do so but other interpretations such as taking it to be a
practical warning and not as a prediction are legitimate opinions, The
pratical warning interpretation is taken by Pope Benedict XVI in ""God and The
World "" under the question ""Two Roads"". As in the Book of Revelations, John
mentioned he saw an innumerable crowd of people.)  
  
  
The main point I am trying to make here is that, looking forward to people's
punishments isn't healthy and shouldn't be encouraged. You shouldn't comfort
people who is faith has been shaken by ambiguous statements by saying ""don't
worry, those who made those statements will be brutally punishment"".

"A pope is said to speak _ex cathedra_ or “from the chair” when he solemnly
puts forward some teaching in a manner intended to be definitive and
absolutely binding. This is also known as an exercise of the pope’s
_extraordinary magisterium_ , and its point is to settle once and for all
disputed matters concerning faith or morals. The First Vatican Council taught
that such _ex cathedra_ doctrinal definitions are infallible and thus
irreformable. The _ordinary magisterium_ of the Church too (whether in the
person of the pope or some other bishop or body of bishops) can sometimes
teach infallibly, when it simply reiterates some doctrine that has always and
everywhere been taught.",684

""However, the differing accounts of infallibility do PROVE that humans can be

You are hiding behind a funny obsession about infallibility. The joke is that
it amounts to a useless and ridiculous infinite regress. I.e. ""You are not

""But can he create a physical universe containing 127 and 128 in which the
former is not prime and the latter is not a power of 2?""  
  
Yes.  
  
Every created thing is an image of God even though the created thing may not
seem like God at all. We say that the image exists pre-eminently in God. So if
one says a house is like the architect who designed it, we say that the house
exists pre-eminently as an image in the mind of the architect, and he creates
his observable plan drawings from the unobservable image in his mind and the
house is built from these drawings by his agent, the carpenter. So the house
is an image of the architect. This is straight out of Aquinas.  
  
In the same way, I can specify a model, or image, of God. The model exists
pre-eminently in God and is like Him, even though it is just me who specifies
the model. God is not limited by the limitations of the model, but what can be
shown in the model exists pre-eminently in God.  
  
The model, or likeness, is an infinite unbiased binary sequence of 50/50 bits.
All finite subsequences exist within this infinite sequence. If the
consecutive binary digits are each 50/50, then the infinite sequence is a
normal sequence. Even so, any subsequence of specified finite length could be
missing a particular sub-sub-sequence of itself because such a subsequence
itself must appear normally within the infinite sequence. Therefore, discovery
by bitwise examination of a subsequence of finite length, no matter how long,
that misses a particular sub-sub-sequence cannot be a demonstration that the
infinite sequence is not normal.  
  
A description of finite space and time is encoded by a finite subsequence of
the infinite normal sequence. A computer that can run the subsequence as a
program, including memory, could virtually reproduce all that we experience of
reality, given the finite resolution of our senses in time and space. We would
not be able to tell whether a missing sub-sub-sequence would exist further
along in time in which the rules of arithmetic are no longer what they were.
Since the infinite sequence is of random bits, the rules of arithmetic really
are not rules. They have just appeared to be rules by random chance. The
model, as explained, does not specify God or God's will. So we cannot say from
the model whether God could change what appeared to be rules of arithmetic
into completely different rules where 128 is not a power of 2 and 127 is a
composite number.

You write that ""Honorius, unlike Agatho, was capable of erring in his own
letter because he was not there speaking ex cathedra."" I have to say that this
statement is anachronistic. The term ""ex cathedra"" dates from the Middle Ages,
and the modern doctrine of papal infallibility was first proposed by bishop
Guido Terreni in 1332. To be sure, the formula of Hormisdas (519) declares
that ""in the Apostolic See the Catholic religion has always been kept
unsullied,"" but (a) it was written before Honorius became Pope, (b) it refers
to the Apostolic See, not the Roman Pope, and (c) it says nothing about there
being different categories of papal pronouncements (reformable and
irreformable).  
  
You also suggest that in the case of a future Pope who, while not speaking ex
cathedra, nevertheless teaches error, the Church ""will come to judge harshly
any pope who fomented such a crisis."" I'm not so sure. The reason why the
third ecumenical council of Constantinople (680-681) was able to condemn Pope
Honorius was precisely because its bishops had never been handpicked by him,
whereas today, all bishops in the Latin Church are appointed by the Pope, and
typically, most of the Cardinals who will elect the next Pope were handpicked
by the current one. Thus it appears extremely unlikely that the bishops,
speaking in unison, will judge any Pope harshly. Cheers.",1377

"Hi Tom  
  
The sentence in which I used novelty merely emphasized the point of these
posts namely to demonstrate that it is possible for a pope to commit heresy
and it has happened before.  
  
Here's what I said  
  
""hence the urgency to show that it is possible for a Pope to commit heresy so
that it isn't seen as some kind of novelty""  
  
In this very post he mentions  
  
""The lessons of the case of Honorius are clear. When a pope is not speaking ex
cathedra, it is possible for him to fall into error. ""  
  
To quote Prof. Feser from twitter while he was replying to someone who
questioned that the arguments in this post are also used by heretical
catholics (sedes, liberals) to habitually disagree with Papal statements  
  
""But there are also people whose faith is shaken because they think they're
expected to swallow that which contradicts past doctrine. There's a danger in
not addressing that worry by keeping silent about the possibility of
legitimate disagreement merely because some abuse it.""  
  
It doesn't seem that I said anything different, danger implies urgency.  
  
As for what you mentioned about the abuse scandals, personally, I feel it's a
bit uncharitable to lay all of the blame at the feet of Pope Francis, 99% of
the all the abuse took place preceding this papacy and were just revealed
during this papacy, obviously there have been some hush ups which should be
criticised but those same kind of cover ups took place on a very large scale
during Pope St JPII's papacy, And even Pope Benedict was aware of Mccarrick
and had already imposed some sanctions. How Prelates may choose to respond to
some scandal is a matter of Prudence, prudence maybe wrong at times. There has
also been large scale reform though in regards to the issue though, such as
making the reporting process easier, efforts to make the process more
transparent, candidates to priesthood are also scrutinized to a very high
degree, so there has been some positive change.  
  
As for heresy with regards to sexual morality being perpetuated at the highest
level, with regards to same sex marriage and blessings of such couples and the
like, the document by the CDCF which was put out awhile ago was quite firm,
Pope Francis approved it. Is it not better to go by an official statement then
by unconfirmed reports of someone reporting what the Pope allegedly told them.  
  
With regards to Amoris Latetia, Orthodox Theologians like Mathew Levering have
shown that the texts in doubt can be given an orthodox interpretation.
Obviously it would be better if Pope Francis answered the Dubium himself and
we could criticise him for that. But that doesn't entail that this issue is
such that people have cause to question their faith especially when orthodox  
Interpretations have been offered. In the absence of clarification, one ought
to charitably go with the orthodox interpretation while respectfully awaiting
a reply. If you are someone with a high position in Rome you could even
respectfully use your influence to perhaps prompt some response.  
  
  
As for ""leaving heterodox opinion at the highest levels standing without clear
or any correction"", It can even be argued that Pope John Paul II did the same
with Walter Kasper by promoting him who evidently has a heretical postion on
the very issue of divorce. Pope Benedict XVI while obviously and sternly
disagreeing with him on this issue, did appraisingly mention Kasper's book on
Christ in the intro to his final books on the new testament and Christ.

can't I suggest it, whether it's taken or not is irrelevant and doesn't change

"Melkman, you seem to be fusing two different issues: the first is the
difference between material heresy and formal heresy. Material heresy is
believing X when the Church has taught not-X. You can do this by merely NOT
KNOWING that the Church has taught not-X. Formal heresy adds to the material
heresy the necessary spiritual ingredient of holding the proposition X
obstinately, in the face of the Church's teaching, being aware _that the
Church teaches not-X_. This is the sin of heresy in its formal aspect.  
  
Then there is another distinction, having the sin of heresy, versus the
ecclesiastical crime of heresy. If you obstinately hold X, but _never tell or
act on that belief_ , you could not be held guilty in a Church court for the
ecclesiastical crime, because there would be no knowledge of the fact. So your
heresy could become publicly declared. So it would not be ""formally""
determined heresy, by which you mean "" **officially** NAMED 'the sin of
heresy' by the Church"".  
  
And then there is the distinction between holding an X where the Church has
taught not-X, but in which not-X is _not a formally defined dogma to be
affirmed with Catholic faith, or a definitive teaching ""to be held""
unreservedly_ but a lesser position, taught (""merely"") as a firm tradition.
While a Church court might find you guilty of some crime or other in publicly
asserting X, it wouldn't necessarily be that of ""heresy"" as defined in the
canons. For the latter, the teaching of not-X must be a definitive one, a
teaching on which the Church has **definitively** resolved the debate. So, you
could be found obstinately sinful in holding error, but not that of ""
**formally defined** "" error.  
  
Your point seems to be that even if the position stated by Honorius was
actually material heresy, (a) maybe he wasn't guilty of the obstinacy
necessary for the sin, and (b) nobody in the Church could have successfully
carried out an ecclesiastical trial to _determine_ his guilty status so that
it could be OFFICIALLY DECLARED to be ""heresy"" to all. erick below points out
the additional issue that the true answer had not yet been defined.  
  
To all of this, I will submit: the point of this post is not to answer whether
a pope might be _officially declared_ a heretic, or whether a pope might hold
a position that had already been _officially defined_ to be wrong, but to
discuss whether a pope might ever hold (and teach) what is, materially,
erroneous, on faith and morals; and do so when he _should have known better_

"The Monothelite heresy arose as a sequel to the Monophysite heresy. Orthodox
Christology holds that Christ is one Person with two natures, divine and
human. Monophysitism holds that Christ has only _one_ nature, the divine one.
Monothelitism can be understood as an attempt to find a middle ground position
between Monophysitism and orthodoxy. It holds that while there are two natures
in Christ, there is only one _will_. From the point of view of orthodoxy, this
is unacceptable, for one’s will is an integral part of one’s nature. Hence to
deny the reality of two wills in Christ is implicitly to deny that he has two
natures. (I’m aware that the dispute over these heresies is more complicated

"Dr. Ed Feser gives a brief rundown of the “error” and condemnation of Pope
Honorius I (625-638). He draws mostly from the Patristic scholarship of great
Fr. John Chapman who was a remarkable scholar on the early Papacy and the
issues related to the Latin vs Byzantine Churches throughout the first seven
ecumenical Councils. In my own research, I have come to think that Fr.
Chapman’s is perhaps the best sketch and explanation of the events surrounding
Honorius. There can be no question that Pope St. Leo II, the very Pope who
confirmed the decrees of the Council of Constantinople III (681), that is, the
very council which had accused Pope Honorius of heresy, believed that his
predecessor Honorius had committed a heresy. There can be no question that,
including Constantinople III, three more ecumenical synods repeated the
anathema against Honorius for heresy. Moreover, in the Roman Breviary, up
until the 18th century, included a description of Honorius as a “heretic” for
June 28th, the feast of the Pope who executed Honorius’s condemnation (St. Leo
II). There also can be no question that these Councils, Popes, theologians,
canonists, and general Christian thinkers understood Honorius as a heretic.
Though, you have some exceptions.  
  
One thing that Feser does not venture deeply into is the question of what kind
of “heretical crime” was proven at the Council in 681 over Honorius, a man who
had died 42 years prior to its convocation. At best, Honorius can be convicted
of material heresy since the form added to the matter of heresy has to be
proven. Moreover, since the doctrine of two-wills in Christ was not
definitively settled, even a material heresy in this regard (according to
Catholicism’s developed canon law) could not, of itself, situate one into the
canonical crime of heresy nor the status of mortal sin. Otherwise, we would
have to anathematize the person and memory of St Thomas Aquinas for his
rejection of the Immaculate Conception. But that is impossible since Pope
Sixtus condemned anyone who would accuse another for mortal sin or canonical
heresy when the matter had not yet been resolved by the Apostolic See. While
the Council of Constantinople III cannot be said to have worked with these
parameters, those parameters did become standard and acceptable to Catholic
canon law, jurisprudence, and pastoral theory. It is practical today.  
  
What lessons, asks Feser, can be drawn from Honorius for us today? I think the
most that can be drawn is that a Pope can commit a doctrinal error. But that a
Pope could become teach heresy and thereby become a formal heretic is not
illustrated by the Honorius-event. One might argue that the Honorius-event
lends great precedent that such a thing could, in theory, happen. But there is
nothing in the Honorius-event, according to developed Catholic beliefs on the
nature of heresy and its criminality, that illustrates that precedent. Now, if
we revert back to the standards of the Latin and Greek policies during the 7th
century, then it is a foregone conclusion, a Pope can become a formal heretic.
But it seems to me that we cannot ignore the canonical, theological, and
pastoral developments that have taken place since Honorius to the present day.  
  
For a more relevant historical context wherein a Pope committed an error while
in office, coupling form and matter (but perhaps not pertinacity), you would
have to study the Three Chapters controversy under Emperor Justinian regarding
the Constituta of Pope Vigilius.  
  
PS. For the life of me, when I read Honorius’s letters, my own private
judgment does not see him as a true Monothelite. His statements, as
interpreted by his successor Pope John IV and St. Maximus the Confessor, seem
to me to be speaking of something entirely different.",3786
"And as long as I am at it: can we please get people to STOP referring to some
teaching as ""belonging"" to a special class of the "" _ordinary and universal
magisterium_ ,"" when it is taught universally by the bishops around the world.
That's not what the statement in Vatican II on the infallibility that is
possible to the bishops means. Rather: when the bishops in their sees around
the world exercise their ORDINARY office of teacher, teach the same truth as
certain and ""to be held"", and when there is a (moral) unanimity in their so
teaching, THEN that teaching is infallibly held out to the faithful. There
isn't some special class of magisterium that is an ""ordinary and universal""
one. It's when the particular acts of the bishops in their ordinary office as
teacher are universally in union on a teaching.  
  
Each individual bishop, in so teaching, would not (at first) be able to say
""this is proposed as infallible"", because each one alone hasn't that kind of
authority. But _the Holy Spirit_ can cause the teaching to be proposed
infallibly _by the CHURCH_ by causing the bishops around the world to teach
the same thing. Then it is infallibly taught. But each bishop is just
exercising his ordinary role (and authority) as ""teacher"", i.e. ""magister.""",1263
"Hi--I am glad to see someone else makes the distinction between formal and
material. I commented on myself in my series of remarks before your comments
were visible to me. That discussion might be of interest.  
  
My suspicion is that the formal/material distinction was not formally worked
out in Catholic theology yet. In retrospect, it seems practically impossible
for either a current or a deceased Pope to be judged a formal heretic, for
reasons I give. I also comment on the ramifications this might have both for
the Honorius case, as well as possible future cases like it.",581
"The late pope is included by the council in a long list of anathematized
heretics:",82
"To be sure, there have over the centuries nevertheless been those who have
tried to defend Honorius, the most eminent being St. Robert Bellarmine (in
Book 4, Chapter XI of _On the Sovereign Pontiff_ ). But his arguments are
weak, and were rejected by later orthodox Catholic theologians. For example,
Bellarmine proposes that “perhaps” Honorius’s letter to Sergius was faked by
the heretics, though he also argues that if this theory is rejected, the
letter can be given an orthodox reading. But these strategies obviously
conflict with one another. If the problematic parts of the letter were faked
by heretics precisely for the purpose of spreading their heresy, then how can
they plausibly be given an orthodox reading? Or if these parts of the letter
are in fact orthodox, how can it plausibly be maintained that they were faked?
Wouldn’t heretics forging a letter have put into it statements that clearly
supported their position?",935
"Honorius, unlike Agatho, was _capable_ of erring in his own letter because he
was not there speaking _ex cathedra_. And he actually _did_ fall into error in
this case because _he was not teaching in continuity with tradition_. After
all, as the [First Vatican
Council](https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/first-vatican-council-1505)
emphasized when proclaiming papal infallibility, the whole point of
infallibility is not to license the pope to teach novelties, but on the
contrary, to guarantee that he preserves traditional teaching:",540
"On top of that, Chapman adds: “Honorius was mentioned as a heretic in the
lessons of the Roman Breviary for June 28th, the feast of St. Leo II, until
the 18th century” (p. 116).",177
"All concede that a Pope can error in his non-definitive but authoritative
magisterium(i.e. non-infallible). The question is to what extent can he error?
It is also wrong to view such magisterial teaching as not having any more
divine protection than that of any other Catholic, be they theologian or even
Bishop. And the argument is that although error is possible, it is limited and
there is protection against teaching grave errors that could endanger the
souls of the faithful -because hundreds of millions of ordinary catholics
aren't in a position to weigh each non-infallible but authoritative teaching
and ""decide"" if the Pope is somehow contradicting a prior teaching that was
CLEARLY taught definitively under the charism of infallibility - and only then
give their ""religious assent of will and intellect"". Their is limited
permission to dissent to such teaching and that presupposes the knowledge and
capacity to judge such matters - over and against the Holy See who must have
already made such a judgement before issuing the teaching.  
  
As for the Honorius case, you make the best case for your ""side"" but I am not
compelled. Have read these detailed debates for years from both sides and I
side with Bellarmine (other than the ""forgery"" defense) and his successors who
have since made more detailed arguments than his to push back on the points
you and the Catholic Encyclopedia author legitimately raise.",1422
"Thank you for your prayer. I'm attracted to Catholicism partly by the good
example of Catholics such as yourself and Dr Feser, who show me that

little about the head. Catholicism seems to get the balance better.",368
"Dear Tom  
  
Thanks for your kind reply!  
  
I get your point.  
  
Obviously we aren't supposed to have a mission against a brother in Christ or
for that matter any sincere seeker of truth.  
  
I honestly don't have a mission against Prof.Feser, I mean if I did, I
wouldn't post on the blog in the first place, nor would I have complemented
this post as informative if you look to my very first post. I have always
admired Prof. Feser's work and eagerly await all his new work including blog
posts  
  
Also to be fair to myself, I didn't mention Professor Feser by name in my
first post which was related to the article, I only alluded to a certain
section of the article namely the ending which I personally thought may come
off in a certain away. I admit that the initial snide comment (cheers etc) was
in retrospect not required and uncharitable on my part. But in that entire
first post if you look at it, there wasn't any reference to Prof but only my
take on faith and punishment.  
  
In the second post where I did mention Prof Feser by name (negative,
critical), I also mentioned ""justifiably"" and ""understandably"". I even
mentioned justifiably so as to suggest that the frustration and overall bleak
outlook on this papacy can indeed be justified. And can even be the subject of
an interesting and wholesome exchange like the one we had now. Even I become
negative and critical from time to time. It isn't really wrong to be so. Again
I admit the word ""bitter"" was a bit of an overstatement. I think what I was
going for was is, ""exasperated"" with this papacy.  
  
And the overall context of that second post was to point to a hypothetical
scenario where a Pope who was orthodox in every except the death penalty and
ponder on what would be or should be our reactions. I indicated that Prof's
reaction would be more or less similar to what it is now however you may
classify it. And I also indicated that I am unsure of what my reaction would
be in that hypothetical scenario, maybe it could be just like Prof's. I was
namely looking for answers on that, on what should be our reaction, not
passing judgement as such on anyone.",2143
"The Church does not hold, however, that popes _always_ teach infallibly when
not speaking _ex cathedra_. The First Vatican Council deliberately stopped
short of making that claim. One reason for this is that there have been a few
popes (though only a few) who erred when not exercising their extraordinary
magisterium. The most spectacular case is that of Pope Honorius I (pope from
625-638 A.D.), who taught a Christological error that facilitated the spread
of the Monothelite heresy, and was formally condemned for it by several Church
councils and later popes.",564
"I want to pick up on something that Todd said, above:  
  
_authoritative magisterium (i.e. non-infallible)_  
  
I have seen phrases similar to this in many comments (not just blog comments,
but (probably even more) news articles and editorial comments in published
sources. I want to cry 'foul' on the idea of an ""authoritative magisterium"" of
the pope, being somehow a distinct category from his other stuff that he
teaches that is, you know, NOT ""authoritative"" or not ""magisterial"" or not
""authoritatively magisterial"".  
  
**There ain't no sich category"".**  
  
At least, that's what I am inclined to argue, though I am willing to be given
better material to become educated on the issue.  
  
Pope's generally don't go around stating which of their teachings are
""authoritative"" or ""magisterial"". By coming from a bishop, they automatically
_participate_ in the magisterial office of the Church. That's it. All bishops
participate in that office, and they are all _authoritative_ when they
exercise their authority to teach. Period.  
  
The bishops (all of them) _must necessarily_ participate in the magisterial
office of the Church in order to be the agents by which a teaching be
infallibly taught _by the universal magisterium of the bishops around the
world_. If they can do it SOME of the time, then they **have** the role. And
they all have the authority.  
  
Now, there are indeed different _degrees_ by which those teachings enjoy the
protection of the Holy Spirit. THAT's open to ""full"" versus something lesser.
A pope has a heavier hand in that _being protected_ than other bishops, but
his participation in the magisterial office isn't _utterly_ unlike that of the
other bishops. He can still err (as proven), and (more importantly) _just like
the other bishops_ his teachings are capable of DIFFERENT DEGREES of
commanding that respect that comes under ""religious assent"" from the people of
the Church. A pope, just like other bishops, teaches some things mildly, some
things firmly, and some things _very_ firmly, without invoking the
infallibility of an ex cathedra declaration. Similarly, popes (and other
bishops) teach some things _in identical fashion_ as those before him for many
centuries had, for some things, while on other things he sets out with a new
metaphor, or a new explanation for an old doctrine, and _all the degrees in
between_ that carry all the possible degrees of assertiveness.  
  
AND THEY DON'T SIT THERE TELLING US WHERE EACH STATEMENT LANDS on these scales
of firmness, traditionalness, etc. Indeed, if anything, the popes and bishops
are _highly_ reticent to STATE EXPLICITLY anything about how firmly our
obligation of religious assent kicks in for most of the things they say. We
are left discerning that by _various markers_ that are available, including
tradition, tone of 'voice', type of teaching occasion or document, etc. But
(short of a solemn declaration by an ecumenical council) these markers make
such discernment a chore and often only _probable_. Such, I think, is the life
of the educated Catholic.  
  
I would propose that the only teaching stuff that comes from the bishops that
is ""not magisterial"" is the stuff that they themselves SAY is uncertain,
putting in qualifiers like ""I feel that this is right, but I don't insist upon
it"" and ""there is room for disagreement on this"" and so on. Everything else is
""teachings"" and therefore is magisterial. That's what the office of bishop
implies.",3468
"""Mathematics just is not objective, somehow outside of creation. It is what
God wants it to be.""  
  
No, God is not free in that way. He doesn't ""want"" 127 to be a prime and 128

""If He wants it to be possible to square a circle, he can make it so...""  
  
No, He can't, if the attempt to square the circle takes place under the
classic conditions. Nor can He make pi = 3 or 128 into a prime number. I don't
think you understand either God's nature or mathematics.  
  
""If theologians disagree, so what? People disagree. You can't prove anything
important from that.""  
  
Ah, but you can: you can prove either that there is no objective proof or that
something is interfering with people's ability to understand the objective
proof. As I said: they don't disagree in math when there is an adequate and
objective proof. But humans do disagree when there isn't such a proof or when
cultural and psychological factors interfere. That is why they disagree about
infallibility. Everyone claims to have a proof, but it differs from group to
group: Catholics vs Orthodox vs Protestants vs Muslims vs etc. And there are
also disagreements within the separate groups. So who is right? As I said,
it's an absurd situation.",1269
"Son of Ya'Kov, that sounds fair enough. And of course, the strict sense of the
term we have did not apply then. Over last five hundred years the overwhelming
majority of theologians defend Pope Honorius from the charge of being a
heretic for good reason.  
  
Erick, I think the very loose application of the term heretic by Pope Felix
III (cited in the next post) confirms the view that the Councils' declarations
using it do not necessarily have the same meaning they would today. Therefore,
we apply the understanding of Vatican I: ""unfailing faith"" in all Popes.",566
"Dr. Feser, respectfully, you make a clear error here. The council being wrong
about Honorious being a heretic would be an error in a judgment of historical
fact, not a matter of faith and morals. The matter of faith and morals would
be the judgment of monothelitism as heresy, which is entirely true and
accurate; whether or not Honorious was a heretic is a matter of historical
fact and judgment, and the Council is not and never has been stated to be
protected on questions of that kind. You claim that judging Honorious to be a
heretic is a matter of faith and morals, but this is wrong; the matter of
faith and morals is the condemnation of the *teaching* as heresy. If a
judgment of an individual as a heretic was protected infallibly,
excommunications could not be lifted years after someone's death, yet this
happens all the time.  
  
If Honorious was using his authority as the Pope to teach - and I disagree
that writing anything in a private letter rises to such authority, as when the
Pope attempts to teach something to the universal church he addresses the
Church directly - then Honorious cannot teach heresy. The reason is that we
are obliged to give religious assent of will to anything a Pope teaches from
the ordinary magisterium, and the Magisterium cannot bind us to sin.  
  
Honorious was *possibly* a heretic by the standards the Councils were using at
the time but absolutely *not* a heretic by the standards we use to judge
heresy today, as monothelitism had not yet been definitively judged as false
by the Church. If we were to call him a heretic in the way that Vatican I
understands the term, we'd also have to call St. Thomas Aquinas a heretic for
rejecting the Immaculate Conception.  
  
So I disagree with your argument here. The Magisterium cannot teach heresy as
understood by Vatican I's definitions of teach, heresy, and Magisterium, and
Honorious did no such thing.",1904

"Bellarmine even suggests that maybe Leo’s letter, too, was faked! The positing
of so much fakery illustrates just how desperate the arguments of even as fine
a mind as Bellarmine’s have to be in order to try to get Honorius off the
hook. And that is why such arguments were largely abandoned. As another
Catholic historian of the era of Chapman and Butler, Fr. H. K. Mann, stated in
his book _[The Lives of the Popes in the Early Middle Ages , Second edition,
Volume I, Part
I](https://archive.org/details/livesofpopesineav1ptmann/page/n17/mode/2up)_:",551
"Then there is the fact that the Third Council of Constantinople condemned
Honorius. Here too Bellarmine suggests that one strategy to defend Honorius
would be to propose that the relevant passages from the council proceedings
were faked, and inserted by enemies of Rome. But the council proceedings
elsewhere _praise_ Rome and other popes, so what sense would this have made?
Alternatively, Bellarmine suggests, perhaps the council really did condemn
Honorius, but did so under the mistaken assumption that he was a heretic. This
is not a problem, Bellarmine says, because a council can be mistaken about a
historical (as opposed to doctrinal) matter. But even if the council had been
mistaken about Honorius, in condemning him it was teaching that popes can
(when not speaking _ex cathedra_ ) be guilty of heresy, and _that is_ a
doctrinal matter. The larger lesson of the case of Honorius (namely that popes
can err when not teaching _ex cathedra_ ) would remain, whatever one thinks of
Honorius himself.",1006
"Tony, thank you for taking the time to read my posts. I am not clear on what
issues you think I am fusing, but I THINK it is that i did not distinguish
formal heresy from the ecclesiastical crime of heresy.  
  
If I understand you correctly, I would say that my posts presume a case where
a person does not consider his views to be heretical (as I would presume was
the case with Honorius). I understand that a person could admit to knowing his
view was heretical, and hold to it obstinately, and it be formal without ever
being denounced by ecclesial authority.  
  
So I accept that in principle the ecclesiastical crime of heresy and formal
heresy are different. BUT, it seems to me that where a person does not take
his view to be heretical, they basically conflate. The debate then would be
whether a judgment by an authority is needed for us to discern whether or not
they had sufficient basis to know the view was heretical. I THINK this might
be where you and I disagree.  
  
I would certainly acknowledge that one COULD be aware, in reality, that his
view was heretical without such a judgment. But could anyone outside of the
person himself sufficiently discern that? That is the question. My view would
be that the only way we could know this definitively is if a judgment was made
against the person, and he remained in his error.  
  
And I think this then applies to the case of Honorius (BTW, elsewhere I noted
Erick's point that there is the additional issue of no council having declared
on monothelitism yet at the time of Honorius' letter, an additional wrinkle).
I did state in places that I realize Feser was not addressing as such the
distinction between formal and material heresy. I raise it to point out that
in principle one could be anathematized on material heresy alone where that
was not a clear understanding of this distinction, but such an anathema in
retrospect is problematic. So that would prompt a further discussion as to
given that the Church never later teaches anything not already implicitly
supported by the defined deposit of faith, we must presume that those
condemning Honorius would in fact be aware of something like material and
formal heresy distinction, and still condemned him anyway.  
  
My contention would be that we should not take their condemnation as proof
that a pope could be guilty of teaching something sufficiently close to formal
heresy, as I THINK you are suggesting. Rather, I would be inclined to do the
reverse. Given that what the Church herself now implies (as I take it) about
the relationship between formal heresy and the ecclesiastical crime of heresy
(in cases where the person does not consider his view heretical), we can see
that cases such as Honorius' prompted the need to develop the formal/material
distinction more clearly. I think it is also fair to say that over time the
Church has come to be procedurally more rigorous in understanding teachings to
be DEFINITIVE only when formally pronounced in councils or ex catheda, even if
we can contend that there can be infallible doctrine not so explicitly
defined. But the ability to judge a person in relation to what they hold in
such doctrines does in fact seem to differ when certain distinction and
juridical procedures are more defined than they appear to have been in the
time of Honorius' condemnation.",3344
"The trouble for Pope Honorius began when Sergius, patriarch of Constantinople,
wrote to him on the topic of Christ’s will and proposed a compromise that
might appeal to disaffected Monophysites.  In his reply, Honorius affirmed
that it is better to avoid speaking of either “one or two operations” in
Christ, and even affirmed a sense in which there is “one will” in Christ. The
problem is that the first claim seems to leave wiggle room for Monothelitism,
and the second seems positively to affirm it.",502

I have not been criticizing Pope Francis, but ""Amoris Laetitia"" (which you

of guidance from the Pope, and if these criticisms were not well founded, the
plain, simply spoken guidance becomes all the more important. That people feel
the absence of this is a problem. The suffering of people who feel, rightly or
wrongly, that the Church is going off the rails needs urgent attention, not
""official"" statements or abstruse theology from people no one has heard of. It
needs careful shepherding by the person who issued the letter - the Pope.  
  
That its absence is no excuse for loss or destabilization of faith really says
nothing. No one has excuses for their sins, and yet everyone faces attacks
caused by imperfect trust in God precisely because we are human, and that is
why loving pastoral guidance is needed. ""Let God sort them out, I know why
their fears are unjust"" is insufficient. The absence of this guidance is fair
game for criticism. The respectful waiting that you advise justifiably grows

his condemners thought he was sufficiently guilty of BLAMEWORTHY heresy, but
in time the distinction between formal and material, and its relation to
ecclesiastical crime of heresy, needed to be developed in order to assess
cases like Honorius' more effectively, the result being that such a
condmenation today would not be tenable. (Though his teaching could still be
criticized in juridical decisions, etc.). And this would prompt the follow up
issue of whether juridical declarations of councils are subject to later
revision, etc.--I don't have a firm stance on that, though I suspect it would
be possible, at least in terms of adding various clarifications and
disclaimers, etc. in light of more recent developments--i.e. not necessarily

private theologian. He was doing no such thing. Sergius wrote to him seeking
the authoritative advice of the bishop of Rome, and Honorius responded in that
capacity. And the error was extremely grave, for as Chapman notes, the
Monothelite heresy really only gained momentum after Honorius’s response to

its own will. Conventionally we say a rock does not have a will.

A lunatic has a logic somewhat damaged (by convention) but still closer to
normal. He can will himself (usually) to put food into his mouth and even raid
the fridge, and even if his neurons are so destroyed that he can't do that,
his body will digest the food under its own degraded logic. Of course he could
be dying, but that is to be undergoing a change of state to something that is
no longer human (lacking a will).  
  
Mathematics just is not objective, somehow outside of creation. It is what God
wants it to be. Furthermore, God is beyond our understanding. If He wants it
to be possible to square a circle, he can make it so and we have only human
arguments against it using the logic that God willed us to normally have,
rather than another.

"_We affirm that in Christ there be two wills and two operations according to

was the ruler of Rome, as he followed them in these things**_.",367
"To be sure, Mann defends the orthodoxy of the actual content of Honorius’s
letter to Sergius. But he acknowledges that the council and later popes did
indeed condemn Honorius. In response to the suggestion made by some that the
council criticized Honorius only in some weaker manner than it did the
Monothelite heretics, Mann says that “it seems, however, more likely that they
did” condemn him in the same manner, and that “it cannot… be denied that it is
more natural to assume that all those condemned by the council were all
condemned in the same sense” (p. 343). Mann also notes, as Chapman does, that
“after the sixth general council the Popes in their profession of faith were
wont to condemn Sergius, etc., ‘and Honorius, who gave encouragement to their
heresy’” (p. 344).",780
"(continued from previous 2 posts)  
  
With this in mind, take the question now to the issue of future Popes making
judgments about the views of previous popes. As Vatican I notes, we might ask
if a future Pope could override the judgment of a previous Pope as to whether
that previous view was indeed heretical or not. Indeed, this might even hold
to the previous Pope's own views. BUT, it is still hard to see how one could
judge that the previous pope was FORMALLY heretical, since he presumably would
not have taken his own view to be heretical. Could a future pope judge that a
previous pope really did know his view to be heretical, etc.?  
  
This raises some very thorny issues indeed. It seems to me that this could not
occur because as I understand it, part of the process of declaring someone a
formal heretic is that the person is confronted by the authority with a
judgment of heresy, and obstinately persists in his views. Obviously, this
cannot happen for someone who is deceased.  
  
Another difficulty of course is that if we say future popes can override the
judgment of prior popes, then we would also have to hold that an even later
pope could override THAT judgment, and so on. BUT, given that we hold that
Popes are bound by magisterial teaching, one might ask how this could happen.
Or, are popes bound only by magisterial teaching, and not by all previous
magisterial juridical decisions, etc.? If we hold that juridical judgments are
not infallible (even if they are authoritative in their time), then it seems
one could, in theory, later remove the anathemas of Honorius, or whatever. (It
certainly seems in other cases a future pope could override earlier papal
juridical decisions--e.g., we can conceive of a person excommunicated being
reinstated in the church by a future pope, and so on--does this change when
the decisions are concretized in conciliar declarations, etc.? Important
questions--to be continued, one final segment....).

""He doesn't ""want"" 127 to be a prime and 128 to be a power of 2. They are
those things per se.""  
  
They are these things for either one of two reasons.  
  
First, they are so because of a system of axioms with rules of inference that
allows us to prove it as a conclusion of a formal argument. This method of
proof is not necessarily connected with the world we measure and physically
inhabit. For example, without the infinite parallel postulate the axioms can
have added to them an intrinsic curvature in which by locally parallel
transport a circle can be constructed whose area is a rational multiple of its
radius and this circle can definitely be squared.  
  
So much for ""per se"" or human fiat. I don't even have to invoke the God beyond
human understanding to get that.  
  
The second method is by measuring the physical world we inhabit and building
up a finite mathematics which cannot be fudged up by arbitrarily adding axioms
which have not been physically proven themselves.  
  
Well it is just God's choice (will) that the local physics supports your
system. We can examine what God *can* do by examining what a model of God
allows, but we cannot examine what God *cannot* do this way because God is
greater than a model of God (a picture of you can show your hair color but it
can't jump or walk - but you can jump or walk and jump because you are not
limited by what the picture cannot do) . If you conclude from a model that God
cannot do something, you have only proved that it can't be done in the model -
which is not God.  
  
A good physical model of God is a computer with a program. A computer program
exists in which any circle, measured in the program, is exactly 6 times its
radius. This can be illustrated as a virtual reality in which virtual actors
measure virtual circles and always get that result. It can be shown as a
visual animation that can be watched, as in a computer game. This is a model
of God. If it can be made logical (in the measuring sense, the second method
of proof, in which axioms are experimentally determined as described above) on
a computer, then God can make it logical in physical reality, which, of
course, would be a different physical reality then the one we have come to
know and love.  
  
Similarly, God is not limited to creating a physical universe where 127 is
prime and 128 is a power of 2. It just outrages your sense of mathematical
truth as it is known to you from living in this universe, but emotion doesn't
belong in mathematical proofs (in this universe).  
  
It is just an old ""rule"" without ground that mathematics and logic are
independent of God. It is just an assumption.  
  
""So who is right?""  
  
That you cannot, in your mind, know who is right does not mean that there is
no truth or that no one can enunciate it on a particular matter. That 15
people give different accounts of some event does not mean that none of the
accounts are correct. If you drive from Topeka to Billings and two witnesses
disagree on what you had for lunch, that does not mean that neither of them
were correct. You had a tuna and marshmallow sandwich. One witness said you
had a ham and cheese sandwich. The other said you had a tuna and marshmallow
sandwich.  
  
Is this inconceivable?

"Erick, Vatican I explains how those Councils condemning Pope Honorius for his
failings must be interpreted. For the First Vatican Council cites the Fourth
of Constantinople: ""For in the apostolic see the catholic religion has always
been preserved unblemished"", which is hardly consistent with a heretical Pope
not long prior to it. The Vatican Council defines: ""This gift of truth and
never-failing faith was therefore divinely conferred on Peter and his
successors in this see..."". The quality of never-failing faith (not exactly
the same thing as speaking ex cathedra) has to be understood as pertaining to
all Popes, including Honorius. The task of theologians is to interpret the
case of Honorius with this understanding in mind, I would suggest, rather than
have too many hangups about inflammatory language by oriental bishops that
confounded (as we understand it today) formal heresy with aiding and abetting.  
  
I think Fr. Amman's argument above does that well. Vatican I tells us
explicitly what we cannot infer from the Roman breviary, at any time.",1062
"The famous paragraph slipped into the Fourth Council of Constantinople’s
deliberations had more to do with the inflamed politics of the East than the
wrongs of Pope Honorius. The Lateran Council of 649, rejecting Monothelitism,
had blamed the orientals, making no mention of Pope Honorius. Pope Agatho got
his legates to bring to the Council of Constantinople a letter in which he
stated: “From the day when the leaders of the Church of Constantinople tried
to introduce heretical novelties in the immaculate Church of Christ, my
predecessors never ceased to exhort them… that they had to abstain… [from
proclaiming the error concerning the single will etc.]”.  
  
The Council’s machinations contradicted Pope Agatho and resulted in a wording
that was modified by Pope Leo II (upon receiving notice of its deliberations)
when he ratified it. This was the version he then sent to Constantinople and
all the bishops of the West. Pope Leo, in his explanation of the affair to the
bishops of Spain, clearly distinguished between the list of heretics named by
the Council, and Pope Honorius, censured for being negligent.  
  
  
In a long article in the Dictionnaire de theolgie catholique (1931, the DTC
was in another league entirely from the estimable Catholic Encyclopedia), Fr.
E. Amann, professor of theology at Strasbourg, concludes: “For us, the two
letters of Pope Honorius represent a doctrinal intervention of the Roman
pontiff in a debated question: referring to previous decisions, without adding
anything new to them except in manner, the pope teaches the theory of the two
natures, each operating according to what is proper to it, and demands entire
acceptance of this doctrine. Alongside this doctrinal teaching is a very
unfortunate prescription on the silence to be kept relative to the formulas in
dispute, ‘one or two energies’”.  
  
He concludes that “… [Honorius’] thought carries greater weight than the
formulas by which he expresses it, that these formulas themselves can with the
greatest rigor uphold an interpretation which does not deviate too much from
official orthodoxy. But to conclude from this, as many theologians have done,
the perfect orthodoxy of the two letters of Honorius, there is, it seems, some
distance.”  
  
Had the Council made a dangerous mistake? “It would certainly have done so if,
taking the question from an exclusively dogmatic point of view, it had passed
a doctrinal and pointless judgment on the very teaching of Honorius….[because
Honorius was basically orthodox, despite his expressions in these letters] the
assembly set itself up as judge much less of a theology than of a type of
conduct and those who engaged in it”.  
  
The weak arguments made by some theologians mentioned in the post do not
devalue their stronger ones – which don’t get a proper mention; the question
of the Pope losing the faith, the issue of formal heresy dealt with by
Bellarmine, surely deserves some explanation. As far as the history goes, Pope
Honorius was NOT a heretic, and Fr. Chapman’s 100 page work does not establish
it.  
  
I think there is a distinction between ex cathedra infallibility (which
permits no stain of error) and the foibles of Popes at other times which,
however much destruction they cause, does not translate into meaning they can
lose the faith. Obviously we aren’t expected to believe that off the cuff
“magisterium” on planes is not free from tendentiousness to the point of
destructive favouring of whatever error is in fashion. That the man doing this
will not lose the faith, ever, is in line with what Vatican One defined
concerning the Faith of the See of Rome that would not fail until the end of
time. Reducing this to the extraction of ex cathedra statements one a century
from men who could otherwise have no faith, or renounce Christ, seems more
like the speech of Balaam’s ass.  ",3860

dreams the future Church will rehabilitate Archbishop Lefebvre and make him a

am proven wrong in the future then the Church calling Honorius a heretic is a
fallible act of discipline(like it was with calling Lefebvre a schismatic

"Well done. You, and I believe someone else, touch on another point I wanted to
make but already had a four part reply. :) As you say, there had not yet at
the time of Honorious been a formal declaration against monotheletism, so one
could not be accused of knowingly opposing a formally established doctrine of
the faith. At most, one could say he erred in failing to make an allegedly
obvious deduction from Chalcedon (all arguable), but that it seems to me would
still just rise to the level of material heresy, because presumably the
failure to make such a deduction would not in itself evidence obstinancy in
error. And, to be a formal error, there would have to be, I think, a formal
declaration of what is to be believed. So I think we are back to (among other
things) the question of whether it even makes sense to accuse a deceased
person of formal heresy (which Feser has not done I realize), unless perhaps
we can explicitly find a place where this person acknowledged he knew his view
was heretical and did not care, etc.  
  
It is also fair to say, I think, that these current insights would prevent
such declarations against Honorius today. And we might have raise, as i have
previously, where future popes could amend the non doctrinal juridical
condemnations of earlier councils, but I would have to know more about the
status of such statement relative to the establishment of tradition to venture
a confident answer on that point. But I am inclined, very tentatively, to say
since judgments are not infallible (even if they are at least authoritative AT
THE TIME they are given) that they could be corrected later--though of course
those corrections themselves could also be the same measure also be reviewed

"(final segment--see previous 3 posts from me)  
  
So, taking all of these points together, we are left to wonder if anyone can
be declared FORMALLY heretical posthumously (at least in a case where there is
no evidence they were judged heretical and obstinately persisted in their
views). This then raises the question as to whether one can, and/or should, be
anathematized posthumously at all. This has obviously occurred, presumably
also in cases other than that of Honorius, so it certainly can happen. BUT,
what we do not have in Honorius's case is a judgment that he was FORMALLY
heretical (a distinction I suspect was not fully formulated or conceived at
the time of Council condemning him). And once this distinction between formal
and material heresy is made, we must face more squarely whether it is
appropriate, or even possible, to condemn someone who is not formally
heretical (as it seems Honorius could not have been). Prior to this
distinction being made, we can likely forgive such anathemas, but it seems
this distinction now affects how such judgments can be made (and perhaps even
how we assess anathemas given before the material/formal distinction was fully
developed).  
  
In any case, we see that it was only a future pope and council who passed
these judgments about a previous pope. At the very least, this should give
great pause to anyone not in such authority to presume too definitely that
anything a current or previous pope did was heretical. But this is especially
true if one goes down the path of implying formal heresy, as for a current
pope that would ultimately require the judgment of the Pope himself, and would
be questionable if even a current Pope could do that in respect to a previous
Pope (see above). I realize Feser is not arguing otherwise, but I suspect some
who read this might apply what he says to current situations and neglect to
appreciate the limits the points I raise place on such assessments. (And, we
might add, such people could never have it seems even more than an opinion,
though perhaps a well informed one, that a current pope held even a materially
heretical view, since the judgment of heresy would ultimately fall to the Pope
himself).  
  
All this said, to reiterate a previous key point, in respect to Honorius, we
can ask whether the current distinction between formal and material heresy
would preclude anathemas like those against Honorius from taking place today.
And, we may even ask whether the authority of a current pope would permit
qualifying, or perhaps even removing, the judgment against Honorius in later
councils, depending upon the extent to which one determines juridical
declarations of councils (bearing in mind juridical decisions do not seem to
be infallible, even if in their time they are authoritative), are or are not
components of magisterial tradition which oblige agreement with current
judgments, papal or otherwise.

Obviously, bloodthirstiness (of a physical or spiritual nature) is incorrect,
the desire to have punishment where perhaps a lighter sentence would do, but
that is merely one end of the bookends of virtue. Justice may require such
harsh punishments, but it may not necessarily. C.S. Lewis wrote on this in his
book ""Mere Christianity,"" with the example of a man who cheats and lies his
way through life without any consideration for others' welfare, and he
challenges the reader not to have a desire that the flag should be planted in
that rebellious soul, which is just a healthy manifestation of justice. I'm
not trying to equate Honorius to that, only to show that a desire for justice
and retributive punishment isn't in itself a wrong, even if the judgment is
harsh, and I think that you would agree that misleading souls from salvation

Now,  
Suppose a very orthodox Pope is appointed who doesn't make ambiguous
statements, who upholds traditional norms on sexual morality, gender,

But there's a catch, he is very inspired by the works of Prof Robby George,

He comes to formally declare that the death penalty is intrinsically evil,
what should be our reaction ? What would be Prof Feser's reaction ? I think

not evaluated by way of a dispassionate consideration of evidence and logical
strength, but dismissed _a priori_ as stemming from bad motives. Policy
differences are attributed, not to sincere but mistaken opinions about what is
best for the country, but to cynical political calculation. The very idea that
there is a common good transcending partisan disagreements, and shared
standards of rationality by which those disagreements might be discussed in

One other thought: Making a distinction between refuting a position and
harming a person is key in all of this. Materialism is self refuting and such
nonsense is extremely harmful for a society. For that reason, the position
does in fact have to be refuted. If we can does this in a calm way, sincere
folks who are confused by materialism will be won over. There will still be
those who don't care about the truth and ignore the sound and valid arguments
that could lead them to the truth. With such people, we can and should pray
that their bad will--which does not care about the truth--might be changed
into a good will that does. This of course requires grace for which we can
pray for even those who are malicious.

"In such cases, “suspicion denotes a certain amount of vice, and the further it
goes, the more vicious it is.” The sin involved can be venial if a person
merely too rashly _doubts_ the goodness of another. However, “when a man, from
slight indications, esteems another man's wickedness as _certain_ [then] this
is a mortal sin, if it be about a grave matter, since it cannot be without

who are carrying out the evil plans of the cosmic powers.

never judge humans, John has Jesus saying the opposite, and he does so clearly

_Jesus said to them, “I did one miracle, and you are all amazed. Yet, because
Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but
from the patriarchs), you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath. Now if a boy can be
circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are
you angry with me for healing a man’s whole body on the Sabbath? Stop judging

innocence:  
  
 **He who interprets doubtful matters for the best, may happen to be deceived
more often than not; yet it is better to err frequently through thinking well
of a wicked man, than to err less frequently through having an evil opinion of
a good man, because in the latter case an injury is inflicted, but not in the
former.**_  
  
I suggest: _On the contrary:  
  
“Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all
kinds of evil against you because of Me. (Matt 5:13  
  
…and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered,
those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame. (1 Peter
3:16)  
  
If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit
of glory and of God rests on you. (1 Peter 4:14)  
  
No weapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every tongue
that accuses you.  
This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and this is their
vindication from me,” declares the Lord. (Isaiah 54:17)  
  
For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me,  
speaking against me with lying tongues. (Ps. 109:2)  
But thou, O God my Lord,  
deal on my behalf for thy name's sake;  
because thy steadfast love is good, deliver me! (Ps. 109:21)  
Help me. O Lord my God!  
Save me according to thy steadfast love!  
Let them know that this is thy hand;  
thou, O lord, hast done it!  
let them curse, but do thou bless! (Ps. 109:26-28) _  
  
So, arguably, the mere _thought <.i> against a man is not injury to him.  
  
I don't think it is easy to establish the last statement in ""in the latter
case, an injury is inflicted, but not in the former."" Let me suggest the
opposite: As often as you injure an innocent man when you judge him evil, just
as often so also you injure _yourself or others_ when you judge an evil man to
be innocent.  
  
To argue this: Let me distinguish: if you judge a man evil when he isn't, but
you do not ACT on this opinion in any way, you do not _actually_ injure the
man as such. **YOUR** thoughts don’t affect him directly, but only via some
further medium. So, the only actual injury he suffers is when you ACT on that
opinion. Now, perhaps the first action you might take is to declare your
judgment to others and this WOULD be harm to him (in some sense or other,
perhaps), but let's eliminate this: it clearly requires not your mere
judgment, but your ACT to tell others. The next most likely downstream
(harmful) event from that erroneous judgment is that you won't give him some
trust on some matter, and this withholding from trust does actually injure
him. Any actual harm requires a transfer from your _thought_ into some
secondary vehicle that goes outside yourself and impinges on him. UNTIL you
have an occasion (such as this withholding trust) to act on your erroneous
opinion, you have not actually injured him. However, there are high prospects
that there WILL be some such occasion, and so it is _very likely_ that you
will injure him. And perhaps this high likelihood is sufficient to say (as a
loose approximation) that you ""have"" harmed him in making the judgment. _",3511
"@Uncommon Descent  
  
I don't think you have understood the account of charity given in this post.
Charity or love is to will the good of another person. This is the highest
call of the Christian and a fulfilment of the entire law. We are called to
love God above all things and to love our neighbor as ourselves. It is in this
that Christians reflect the image of God who is love itself. It is in this
that we show the Spirit of love dwelling within us as ""the love of God is
poured into [our] hearts through the Holy Spirit who is given to us"" (Rom
5:5). It is this love that causes us to obey Christ's commands as Jesus taught
""If you love me you will keep my commands"" (John 14:15). The significance of
this love for our salvation is that ""Christ is the source of eternal salvation
for those who obey Him"" Hebrews 5:9).  
  
This love is even greater than faith (1 Cor 13). Even with faith to move
mountains, without love we are nothing (1 Cor 13). It is this love that causes
our faith to work as what counts is ""faith working through love"" (Gal 5:6).  
  
Again, this is the entire law: to love God and to love neighbor as oneself.
Such love is reflected in the 10 commandments with the first 3 being about
loving God and the second 7 being about loving neighbor. It is for this reason
that Jesus responded to the rich young ruler's question (""what must I do to be
saved?"") by quoting the commandments and then calling him to an act of love
for the poor. It is for this reason that Jesus will separate the sheep and the
goats based on whether or not they cared for those without clothes, food, and
those imprisoned. We will be judged in the end on whether or not love dwells
within us. As God is love itself and this love it poured into our hearts
through the Holy Spirit, it is this love by which we ""remain in Christ"" as
branches remain in the vine. This occurs when we love even our enemies as
Christ calls us to do.  
  
This does not mean that we never correct our enemies or rebuke them. Rebuking
a sinner to stop sinning is an act of love. It is a work of mercy. So is
instructing those that are ignorant. The key point in the post above is that
we should not easily default into thinking that those who disagree with us are
malicious. Having that as a default approach is neither reasonable nor
charitable and given the centrality of both charity and truth in the Christian
life, such an approach is not a Christian approach to discourse.",2453

than addressing his claims or arguments. There is _guilt by association_ , in
which one attributes view X to a person who believes Y simply because other
people who believe Y have been associated with X. There is the _abusive ad
hominem_ , which involves simply flinging a pejorative label at a person
(“racist,” “fascist,” “communist,” etc.) as if this sufficed to rebut his
claim or argument. And there is what seems to compete with the circumstantial
_ad hominem_ for the status of most popular fallacy on social media – the _tu

It might be framed this way: Under what conditions do we ""instruct the

answer to each of these questions is straight forward. We do the former when
dealing with someone who is ignorant (but not malicious) and that latter when
someone is a sinner (i.e. malicious but not ignorant; they know it is wrong
and don't really care). This entails that we are able to recognize and
distinguish malice and ignorance. I think learning to do this effectively is
critical for being able to effectively win people to the truth. If you rebuke
a sincerely mistaken person for their mistake, this is unnecessary. Such a
person just needs instruction. If you give instruction to a malicious person,
this is uneffective because they don't care at all about the truth. Such a
person doesn't need to be taught, he needs to be rebuked. This lies behind
Aristotle's saying that we should not argue with those who deny manifest

have a bad motive. He says that we should not do so _if_ we lack sufficient
evidence to make a certain judgment about the matter, _if_ our judgment tends
to be clouded by dislike of the person, and so on. But with some people, it is
possible dispassionately and objectively to judge from their patterns of
behavior over time that they are indeed acting from bad motives. There is no
sin in making such a judgment under such circumstances. On the contrary, a
habitual refusal to do so can be a vice. As [I have discussed
elsewhere](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2019/11/against-candy-ass-

excessively angry or insufficiently affable or friendly, so too can one sin by

evil. Dogmatic non-judgmentalism would be a similar moral failing. It is not

"Thank you for this much needed and helpful post.  
  
@Infinite Growth:  
  
St. Paul did not forbid all judgement. If he did, he would not have written in
1 Corinthians 5:3, ""For I, on my part, thought absent in body but present in
spirit have already judged him who has so so committed this, as though I were
present.""  
  
St. Paul is referred to a man who is sleeping with his father's wife whom the
Corinthians have not rebuked out of a disordered tolerance that is so well
described in Feser's post above.  
  
Some of the distinctions in the post that are also found in St. Thomas are
helpful to determine in what conditions a judgement can be made without being
rash. One important distinction is between an exterior act (someone's actions
which we can see) and an interior act (an inward intention which only God can
see). You can judge an act and recognize that it is wrong without attributing
to the person malice. The person may be acting wrongly out of ignorance and
this is significantly less culpable than malice. In that instance, you could
approach someone calmly and explain to them why the exterior act was not
moral. This would be an act of mercy that the Church calls ""Instructing the
ignorant."" Again you can do this without assuming that the person is either
malicious or an imbecile. In fact, to instruct someone actually presumes
goodwill. It presumes that they care about the truth and that if you take the
time to explain the truth, that they will be inclined to follow it.  
  
So, we have to make distinctions about what being judged and this can help us
from making assumptions about intentions which we cannot be sure of without
knowing someone's character and habits. This does not prevent us from judging
the exterior acts of anyone even if we don't know them. Nor does it prevent us
from assessing their assertions even if we don't know them.  
  
It is also important to highlight that we can get to know someone's character
and can make judgement's on that. In this, we just have to be much more
careful and, again, err on the side of charity for their good and ours.
However, if someone habitually steals or commits adultery or lies, we don't
have to pretend that they have a good character when it is obvious that they
don't.

"It seems to me that in terms of ""judgement"", it depends on what exactly is at
stake. A lot of the time, it is merely one's opinion of another, that has no
huge consequences to it. You might simply think someone is wrong on some
issue, and the only consequence is what you might say in order to 'correct'
them. Or, someone might be engaging in behaviour that is objectively wrong,
but there is nothing really you can do to stop them, or it isn't your place to
stop them(many kinds of sexual behaviour, for example). That's different from
situations where the person might take advantage of yourself or other people.
Such as, deciding whether to lend a large amount of money to someone. If you
are the only one potentially affected, you might simply allow them to take
advantage of you to a certain extent(Everyone has their limits). If other
people are potentially harmed, though, then it is as you describe. It would be
wrong to simply let them take advantage of others, so you really have to judge
on what is more likely rather than beyond reasonable doubt, because no matter
what you do, there will be a 'winner' & a 'loser' in that situation.",1145

when people hold to them tenaciously (e.g. the prophet Elijah with the
Prophets of Baal). The very fact that they are holding to them tenaciously is
a reflection of bad will or malice and the act of mocking such positions gives
them the opportunity to reject the absurd position in order that they
themselves might not be absurd. This seems to me more in line with ""rebuking
the sinner"" (presupposing bad will) rather than ""instructing the ignorant""
(presupposing some intellectual error arrived at without malice).",680

is that partisanship has become so rancorous, and electronic media so central
to modern social and political interaction, that many people are unable to see
and judge others as concrete individuals. They form a cartoonish general
conception of the beliefs and motivations of those they disagree with, and
project this conception onto the particular people with whom they engage.
Because they do not deal with these opponents in a personal way, but only with
electronic representations (television sound bites, tweets, blog comments, and
the like), the cartoon is difficult to dislodge. Whatever the other person
says, it is assumed that what he “really” thinks is what the cartoon
represents people like him as thinking. And because he is likely to react to
this sinister caricature with anger and insults of his own, his behavior will
even seem to confirm it.",937
" **But the same sorts of thing occur in reverse,** when you judge and evil man
to be innocent: in respect of the **mere judgment itself** neither harm nor
benefit befalls anyone else, including him. But as soon as you act on the
judgment by according him trust as if he were innocent, when he is guilty, you
harm _whatever project hinged_ on according him that trust. This usually means
harm to yourself (because, usually, you will be a participant in that
project), or it COULD be many other people besides yourself. You therefore are
**JUST AS LIKELY** to harm yourself and others in this way as in the first
case above. The two are entirely analogous.  
  
To look at it from a non-personal perspective: in a court of criminal law,
regarding penalties that the law might impose, the judge (or jury) applies a
standard of ""innocent until proven guilty"" and a standard of needing guilt to
be established ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". But in a civil suit, the judge
applies a DIFFERENT STANDARD: the award of damages or benefits is based on a
mere _preponderance of the evidence""_ , i.e. wherever the stronger argument
lies, there is where the judgment lies. And the judge MUST render a judgment
that will be to the detriment (i.e. ""harm"") one of the two parties. Therefore,
he must harm one and benefit the other on the basis of merely _whichever is
one more probably in the right (has the better argument)_ , he cannot choose
to opt out of judging.  
  
Here's the thing: The ""court of public opinion"" and personal judgments are
similar to each other in this - that they are RIGHTLY not restricted to
bringing conclusions only with evidence showing ""beyond a reasonable doubt"".
They both RIGHTLY make judgments based (at least much closer to) on a mere
_preponderance of the evidence_ , OR EVEN LESS! And this applies to the vast,
vast array of social and civic decisions we must make: I choose not to enter
into a repair contract with this roofing contractor because ""he felt slimy to
me"", and nothing more specific than that, is a **perfectly appropriate**
judgment to make. I don't even have to be judging him to be ""slimy"" as being
""more likely than not"" (i.e. above 50%), it would be sufficient for me to do
it based on a lower scale, like 20% or 30% likelihood, because I can go find
another contractor whom I estimate is far less likely to be slimy, perhaps
""less than 5%"". Thus I ""harm"" the first contractor based on a very modest
basis of evidence, and do so with complete legitimacy.  
  
You might recast this judgment as being not ""he IS slimy"" but rather ""there is
a 30% probability he is slimy"", but that doesn't prevent (a) that you made a
negative judgment and a negative CHOICE affecting him, and (b) your choice
does him harm (in some sense). So recasting it that way still causes the
judgment to fall under St. Thomas's stated opprobrium, even though it is
manifestly a right kind of judging.  
  
The only way to repair the argument Thomas gives is to reframe it as: it is
wrong to make FIRMER judgments (against) someone than the evidence (you have)
allows for. And the certain wrongness here lies **primarily in its defiance to
the virtues of truth** , and not ""harm to the person.” The virtues of truth
(e.g. prudence) would have you make DUE judgments that the evidence allows
for, and WITHHOLD from firmer opinions than the evidence allows, and when you
violate that, you _harm yourself_ first, before harming some other. Due
judgments may well rely on less-than-solid evidence, if they are less-than-
solid _judgments_ (i.e. when they are held as opinions). Withholding from
making judgments on incomplete evidence is ALSO a failure of prudence, when a
judgment is needed regardless of the state of the evidence. Commanders in
battle must often make judgments of the enemies tactical object when the
evidence is far from solid, they cannot just wait until they have proof or
even something close to it.",3929

"@Infinite Growth (continued)  
  
The area that we have to be most careful in is in judging particular
intentions associated with a particular act. It is here that judgements are
most unsure. Now, we also have to be careful not to completely de-link
intentions from the exterior act. (This is a problem that occurred in 20th
century Catholic theology. On this point, see Matthew Levering's recent book
The Abuse of Conscience). The act is intended by the person and if the act is
bad then the intention is bad in some way. However, the person again may be
acting from ignorance or confusion or trying to achieve some real good and yet
be going about it in the wrong way. In this instance, you can again explain
moral principles and why a particular act is not good and this should help to
guide their intentions in the future as they realize, for example, that a good
end does not justify a bad means. etc.  
  
However some people are in fact habitually bad. That is, they have bad
character. In this instance another work of mercy is called for: Rebuking the
sinner.  
  
Regarding your suggestion that our only enemy is the principalities, this also
is based on a partial reading of St. Paul. St. Paul also identifies the flesh
as our enemy in Galatians 5:19ff, ""Now the deeds of the flesh (Greek: sarx)
are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery,
enmities, strife, jealousy, etc..."" He warns that those who practice these
things will not inherit the kingdom of God. Flesh is used in multiple and
analogous ways in the NT and can be used to simply refer to the body, but here
it refers to sinful desires, intentions and acts. So the flesh, in this sense,
is also an enemy of the Christian according to Paul.  
  
If we take a broader focus on the New Testament, we also find that ""the world""
(Greek: kosmos) is also an enemy of the Christian and this is reflected in the
writings of St. John. Kosmos is also used in multiple senses in the NT so this
does not entail that each use refers to something bad. However, a worldly
spirit that says ""Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die"" (i.e. ""this
world is all there is""; hence worldliness) is contrary to authentic faith and
is another enemy of the Christian.  
  
It is for this reason that the council of Trent identified three enemies of
the Catholic viator: Satan, the world, and the flesh. So, the suggestion that
we have only one enemy is based on a partial consideration of the New
Testament at the exclusion of other parts.",2520

without any support through argumentation or appeal to Scripture (not even a
proof text). If your assertion were true, we would all be required to

our lives to converting them (which would entail that everyone neglected real

"Now, I sympathize with Chomsky’s view that the so-called hard problem of
consciousness is a pseudo-problem. As I said in my exchange with Goff, I would
say that the problem arises only if we follow Galileo and his early modern
successors in holding that color, odor, sound, heat, cold, and other
“secondary qualities” do not really exist in matter in the way common sense
supposes them to, but instead exist only in the mind (as the qualia of
conscious experience) and are projected by us onto external reality. If you
take this position, you are stuck with a conception of matter that makes it
impossible to regard consciousness as material. The solution, I would say, is
simply not to go along with this assumption in the first place, but to return
to the Aristotelian-Scholastic view the early moderns reacted against, and
which is compatible with the commonsense view of matter. The so-called hard
problem of consciousness then dissolves. As Chomsky’s remarks later in the
discussion make clear, he would be sympathetic with part of this story (though
not, I’m sure, with the neo-Aristotelian bit).",1102

What Coyne is hinting at is that some biological features get actualized

others remain **hidden as potentialities/ ""byproducts"").** Once those
potentialities are exposed to a different set of environmental conditions

Honest question. When it comes to that general point that Chomsky, Nozick, or

features as X"" what can we say? I tried to formulate something along the same
lines as you said in that conversation with Ben Shapiro long ago, that Natural
Selection can't explain why we have the 'features' like the mind because
Natural Selection works blindly - and I give it a read on my TLS copy on that
topic about functions when you're discussing Ruth Milikan's position.  
  
And I'm asking that because it can create a lot of confusion with other issues

Immanent Causality could be a product of Natural Selection when in fact
something could have nothing to do with the other [but the point is not so
easy to grasp like in the case of mind for a non-philosopher like myself]. How
can we disentangle these two? And since I couldn't solve or find by myself

"In the history of physics after Newton, Chomsky says, the prevailing attitude
came to be that anything was acceptable if it could be given a precise
mathematical expression. The predictive success of such mathematical theories
is what mattered, and the metaphysical question about explaining _why_ things
worked in the way the mathematics described receded into the background. For
practical purposes, “matter” came to be treated as just whatever accepted
physical theories happen to say about it. But, Chomsky notes, as early
twentieth-century thinkers like Bertrand Russell and Arthur Eddington pointed
out, physical theory actually tells us very little about what matter is
actually like. It gives us only mathematical structure and is silent about
what fleshes out that structure.",784
"Listening to Goff's discussion makes one realize that this is about how
language does not access certain brain functions. The older version of brain
science as ""thinking meat"" (Harris), moist robots (Dennett), neural correlates

or the ""source and summit model"" (John Paul II) or the brain is a system of
reentrant thalamcortical loops. Hence the conscious functions occur deeper in
the brain or areas for which the scientific language has not been developed.

"Moreover, Dreyfus points out, this computationalist model is an inheritance
from the post-Cartesian approach to scientific explanation, according to which
explaining a physical event involves identifying the laws by which it follows
of necessity from antecedent events, in a manner that might be modeled by a
machine. But this mechanistic model only works when we abstract out of it
anything that smacks of the psychological – consciousness, intentionality, and
so on. (This is precisely why Descartes had to relocate consciousness out of
the material world and in a separate _res cogitans_ , as Chomsky himself
emphasizes later in the discussion with Goff and Frankish.) Hence an approach
that appeals to computational rules, given its essentially mechanistic
character, precisely _leaves out_ what is distinctive of the mental, and thus
cannot coherently claim to _account for_ the mental.",891
"Where the study of consciousness is concerned, recent philosophy of mind has
followed David Chalmers in distinguishing between “easy problems” and the
“hard problem.” Identifying the neural correlates of various kinds of
conscious awareness would be examples of an easy problem. By characterizing
such a problem as “easy,” Chalmers doesn’t mean that it is trivial, or even
easy in every respect. He just means that it is the sort of problem the
solution to which seems clearly attainable using existing methods and standard
scientific and philosophical assumptions. The “hard problem” is explaining why
any of the neural processes in question are associated with conscious
awareness, given that it seems at least prima facie possible that they could
do what neuroscience describes them as doing in the complete absence of
consciousness. (This is alleged to be shown by arguments like Chalmers’
[“zombie argument,”](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2013/12/zombies-
shoppers-guide.html) along with other influential arguments like Frank
Jackson’s [“knowledge
argument”](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2010/07/when-frank-jilted-

"Goff replies by saying that this objection of Chomsky’s presupposes that we
know more about matter than one would otherwise expect Chomsky to think we do,
given his endorsement of Russell’s and Eddington’s point about how little
physics tells us. But Chomsky responds by noting that Goff overstates things
when he suggests that science tells us _nothing_ about the nature of matter.
It doesn’t tell us nothing, just much less than many people suppose. And we
can have evidence for thinking that some theories tell us more about it than
others do. In particular, Chomsky repeats, neuroscience gives us grounds for
concluding that while we are conscious, tables and the like are not.",681
"Yet these pseudo-questions seem, to Chomsky, to be the kinds that the
discussion of the so-called hard problem focuses on. He doesn’t mention Nagel,
but he seems clearly to have in mind questions like “What is it like to be a
bat?” and the idea that neuroscientific research and the like cannot answer
it. The reason there is such difficulty answering it, Chomsky thinks, is that
interrogative sentences like these don’t convey genuine questions. What are
labeled “easy questions” and “hard questions” concerning consciousness pretty
much correspond, in Chomsky’s view, to genuine questions and pseudo-questions.",612
"Indeed, as Hubert Dreyfus has argued (under the influence of this
phenomenological tradition) it is a mistake to think of the unconscious on the
model of rules (such as Chomskian rules of universal grammar). For rules
always have an explicit content that must be understood before one can apply
them. And to appeal to further rules in order to determine the interpretation
of the first set just raises the problem again at a higher level, which
threatens a vicious regress. (See e.g. the discussion of rule-following

"Hey Ed you should check out that new paper published by Brian Cutter and
Dustin Crummet. They argue for theism through the phenomenon of ""psycho-
physical harmony.""  
  
On first glance it seems like it presumes some sort of Cartesian division of
matter and the mental. Would love to see your thoughts on it in maybe a future
post.

"Hey, Tom!  
  
Thanks for answering me!  
  
""Even if you want to suggest that evolution is a good explanation for why we
have such a feature, that itself is a pretty bad explanation for the feature
itself.""  
  
I don't want to suggest that evolution is a good explanation for the
phenomena, I just asked what can we say in response to that - on a
philosophical level. Because these guys I quoted use some energy trying to
explain features, functions, etc. based on evolution and I wish to know how to
prove on philosophical grounds why appealing to that is wrong.  
  
In what follows, I will try to give some background.  
  
""In other words, how do you know that natural selection is blind, other than
by assuming it, in which case there is nothing that you can say? But there is
a lot of randomness in the environment in which natural selection operates.""  
  
I'm not advocating that it's blind or not. I was quoting Ed - if I get him
right anyway - on his answer to Ben Shapiro in this video
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FvYwpyFbIQ). You can see the specific
question that Ben is formulating at 39:57 and Ed's response in the following
minutes (but I would suggest that you watch the whole video).  
  
Now, back to Ed's response - again, if I get him correctly - he's not arguing
against Natural Selection blindness, he's saying Natural Selection could not
explain why the human mind is directed at truth (it is really important to
note that he's talking about TRUTH directness, not just any other feature in
the present case) and I agree with him (because just like he said, natural
selection explains fitness and passing genes). And it's important to note too
the fact that he was presupposing that it was true when he formulated the
argument - not because he may agree with it or not - but because its trueness
or not had nothing to do to the point that he was making (again, he said that
natural selection explains fitness, etc. and that's not related with the mind
directedness for truth per see).  
  
So, now that I made this background to avoid any misunderstandings what I'm
trying to ask is: could we make a similar answer disentangling body unity and
evolution or natural selection claims?  
  
I do not have any problem with evolution at all. I was just trying to say that
someone could conflate two problems (evolution on one side and unity and
substantial form on the other).  
  
For example: if someone says that our unity is caused by ""an evolutionary
process that co-opted our cells to do what they do now'' someone, plausibly,
may think that our unity is just an accidental one.  
  
Personally, I don't think that's true - I think that's insane - but some
people believe this. But I can't just say that that's insane - that would beg
the question. Instead, I would have to argue philosophically to show that. And
that's what I'm trying to say: these two problems i.e the unity substance's
(or we can think of its organs functions related to each other as one
indivisible unity) and natural selection or evolution could have nothing to do
with it each other - but they might seem at least to be related and someone
might argue something like the example I presented. That's why I'm asking Ed
if we could (or how to) disentangle the two (like in the same way when he was
explaining why truth per se has nothing to do with natural selection).",3372
"Now, Chomsky proposes that though a sentence like “What was it like to see the
sunset last night?” asks a genuine question, the sentence “What is it like to
see a sunset?” does not. Similarly, he says, “What is it like to see this red
spot?” is a real question, but “What is it like to see red?” is not. There
are, he says, ways we might go about explaining what seeing last night’s
sunset was like or what seeing this red spot is like. By contrast, he claims,
there is no way to go about answering questions about what it is like to see a
sunset full stop, or what it is like to see red full stop. Hence these are
pseudo-questions.",632

"Chomsky’s own criticism of Goff is that he thinks that panpsychism does not in
fact sit well with the whole range of empirical evidence. In particular, he
says that when we take account of the neural phenomena associated with
conscious experience, we have reason to conclude that while human beings are
conscious, tables, say (which have nothing like the complexity of our nervous
systems), are not. There are also intermediate cases, such as fish, where it
is not entirely clear what we should say. But what we don’t have is any basis
for concluding that consciousness exists _all across_ nature, from human
beings to ordinary inanimate objects to fundamental particles. (Goff, as I
noted in my exchange with him, is massively overgeneralizing from a handful of
cases.)",770
"As a linguistics undergraduate in the 1960s, Chomsky revolutionised my
thinking. I have been fascinated by his thinking, both linguistic and
philosophical, ever since.",167
"It might seem that, as with Goff, Chomsky thinks that Frankish takes too far
an insight that they have in common. But Frankish suggests that in fact he and
Chomsky are basically in agreement apart from some terminological issues.  In
any case, here too I am sympathetic with Chomsky’s remarks, though I imagine
that I have a more conservative view than he and Frankish do about how far
science might revise our commonsense perceptual representation of the world.
(The interested reader is directed to what I have to say about the primary
versus secondary quality distinction at pp. 340-51 of _Aristotle’s Revenge_ ;
about representationalist theories of perception at pp. 106-13; and about
neuroscientific evidence vis-à-vis introspection and perception at pp.
442-56.)",769
"Chomsky’s response is that he is partially sympathetic to this, but that he
would be opposed to throwing out of the picture the _psychological_ reactions
we have to the world that people have in mind when they talk about
consciousness. He thinks that the fact that these are genuine phenomena is
evidenced by our ability to theorize about them. (He says that Nelson
Goodman’s book _The Structure of Appearance_ is a good example of how one can
develop a substantive analysis of the way things seem to us in conscious
awareness, whether or not Goodman’s account is ultimately successful.) Chomsky
is also sympathetic to Russell’s view that consciousness is in fact what we
know best.",682
"It doesn’t seem to me, though, that Chomsky’s specific way of making the point
about pseudo-questions is likely to convince someone who doesn’t already agree
that the so-called “hard problem” is a pseudo-problem. The reason is that
questions like “What is it like to see a sunset?,” and “What is it like to see
red?” seem to me interpretable in ways that _are_ susceptible of an answer.
For example, if you had never seen the color red, you might naturally ask
precisely a question like the second one. And if someone then showed you a red
object, you would surely think that your question had been answered. Or, if
someone said “Well, it’s sort of like seeing dark orange, though not quite.
But very different from seeing pale blue,” then you might judge this answer to
be at least somewhat illuminating.",805
"Frankish replies by suggesting that the neural processes underlying
introspection can distort things just as much as those underlying perception
do. But as Chomsky goes on to point out, while _what consciousness tells us_
about this or that object or event is certainly fallible, it doesn’t follow
that the reality of consciousness _itself_ is an illusion. (Here’s an analogy
– mine, not Chomsky’s. Suppose I find that a certain person, Fred, is a
chronic liar. This gives me good reason to doubt the things Fred tells me. But
it hardly by itself gives me any reason to think that Fred _himself_ doesn’t
exist.)",611
"This is indeed a very important point, and Chomsky notes that it fits in with
his well-known work in linguistics, which posits unconscious mechanisms and
rules that underlie linguistic competence. But in my view it is a point that
has been developed in a more penetrating way by thinkers in the
phenomenological tradition (such as Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty) than by the
broadly functionalist or computationalist approach in analytic philosophy of
mind that Chomsky’s work is closer to.",487

We can't see the big picture through scientific study, and so through
scientific study we cannot determine whether or not natural selection is
blind. ""Actual"" randomness versus ""apparent"" randomness expresses this

"Hey, Uncommon.  
  
If you have some time, check this
(https://naturalhistory.si.edu/education/teaching-resources/life-
science/early-life-earth-animal-origins). Now, this is an example of what I
have been trying to say.  
  
Leaving aside the fact that the text tried to implicitly assert the
plausibility of the mitochondria theory as a 'known fact' or true without
arguing - when it's in fact just a theory among others. Look what they say
about animals - especially multicellular ones. And besides the fact of the
'magical' conjoining of diverse cells or microorganisms inside microorganisms,
they are doing exactly as I said in the example.  
  
As I said, this sounds insane. But based on your comments and @Tom Cohoe - and
some things I read of Ed's work - I think we can say something about this.
First, even though this is all true and or cells and etc. we're co-opted by
'who knows why' to work together, the history is very different now than it
was long ago. Our ACTUAL existence is not like it was long ago. They say in
the text that the microorganisms that formed the mitochondria were separable
in principle - at least they suppose it is that way. In our actual existence,
we can't separate our parts and expect them to work ALONE or in the same way,
as it was long ago (again, supposing that they were right) because they are
organs - parts of substances - not substances in their own right.  
  
But one of the major problems I think that all of this has (and I'm basing
myself on somewhat the same analysis that Ed does when discussing atomism in
his Scholastic Metaphysics book) is when it comes to the first organism
because the first organism on earth necessarily had parts that work together -
and work for him. So, even if they say that our unity is an accidental one
(like atomists say), they can't get rid of substance (and prime matter) in the
first place (like atomists).  
  
What do you guys think? This argument could work?",1953
"Russell himself did not take this in a panpsychist direction, but later
thinkers, such as Galen Strawson and Goff, have done so.  Goff argues for
panpsychism by way of an appeal to simplicity or parsimony. I have explained,
in my exchange with Goff linked to above, why I think this argument fails.",298
"This is a longstanding theme in Chomsky’s work, which [I’ve discussed
before](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2010/06/chomsky-on-mind-body-
problem.html). As my longtime readers know, I am entirely sympathetic to it,
and regard it as the key to understanding the intractability of the mind-body
problem. The mechanical-cum-mathematical model of nature presupposed by modern
materialism itself _generates_ the hard problem of consciousness. Materialism
thus cannot in principle _solve_ that problem. Thinkers like Nagel have been
making this point for decades, and are often wrongly thought to be carrying
water for some variation on Cartesian dualism. But as Chomsky’s example shows,
by no means does one have to be any kind of dualist to see the point.",754
"What does Chomsky mean by this? He notes that the mechanical conception of
nature that was put at the center of modern science and philosophy by Galileo
and his successors conceived of matter on the model of machines. The idea was
that the various phenomena studied by the sciences (solar systems, organisms,
or whatever) could be understood as operating according to the same principles
as mechanical artifacts (watches and the like being a favorite paradigm). This
approach to explanation was adopted by all the major early modern thinkers.",542
"Chomsky also engages with Frankish’s illusionism. Frankish is skeptical of the
idea that, in addition to one’s awareness of (say) the taste of the coffee he
is drinking, he is aware via introspection of some inner and radically private
_quale_ of the taste of the coffee. The reality is that, in consciousness, we
are aware of features of the world and of our reactions to them. We are not,
over and above that, aware of some inner Cartesian realm of qualia.",458
"Now, with Newton, Chomsky notes, modern physics abandoned a strictly
mechanical model. What he means is that the early mechanists thought that the
simple push-pull kind of causation that one sees in watches and the like could
provide a model for how the physical world in general works, but Newton
posited forces that did not operate in this way, and indeed the operation of
which he did not explain or claim to explain at all. Gravitation seemed as
“occult” as anything the medieval Aristotelians talked about. Newton’s work
was nevertheless accepted because of the tremendous predictive success
afforded by its mathematical representation of nature. Newtonian physics did
not truly _explain_ the phenomena with which it dealt, but carried the day
because it _described_ them so well.",785
"This brings us to some further important points raised by Chomsky concerning
the origins of the modern mind-body problem. Gilbert Ryle famously
characterized Descartes’ dualism as the theory of the “ghost in the machine.”
It is often supposed that modern philosophy and science after Descartes
preserved his mechanical model of matter while getting rid of the “ghost” of
the Cartesian mind. But as Goff points out, Chomsky’s view is that the truth
is closer to the opposite of this, and in particular that with Newton, modern
thought essentially “exorcised the machine while leaving the ghost intact.”",601
"While I hold a lot of skepticism about McGinn's use of mysterianism on the
hard problem of conscious thought, as a Cathlolic I also would tend to be
very, very cautious about castigating mysterianism _altogether_. After all, we
Catholics are in the position of positing that without the grace of faith, we
**could not know** that God is a trinity of persons, and further that we
cannot really _understand_ (fully) the Trinity in our present state (behind
the veil, through a glass darkly).  
  
Suffice it to say: we cannot invoke mysterianism _merely_ because it is a hard
problem. There must be a properly accounted reason that _explains_ our
inability to access the thoughts needed. In the case of God, we are limited
intelligences, and he is unlimited intelligence, and so our minds are not of a
nature capable (on their own) of encompassing the whole of God. But that
account doesn't work for our own minds: presumably, the nature and workings of
our minds are correlative to _our minds_.  
  
However, it may be possible to argue that we cannot _in principle_ access the
way our minds work **directly** , because when we are thinking an immaterial
thought (say, about pi), we cannot ALSO be thinking second-layer thinking
_about_ that thought, (at least, without the danger of disturbing and ending
the thought about pi in order to think the thought ABOUT the thought about pi.
So, (arguably) we could only ever, at best, draw the conclusions about
consciousness in terms of _indirect_ considerations, rather than via direct
access / observation. That doesn't (quite) get you to the mysterian ""we can't
know"", but it may _limit_ what can be said with certainty.",1667
"Tom:  
  
 **In other words, how do you know that natural selection is blind, other than

a lot of randomness in the environment in which natural selection operates.
How do you know that God has not set up this randomness through a process

I don't think that really works conceptually. It's certainly true that God
sets up ""randomness"" to achieve His ends in ways above human understanding.
The events leading to the crucifixion of Christ are an obvious example
specifically identified in Scripture, for instance.  
  
But in that case, the events aren't actually random in the relevant sense, but
only _apparently_ random. But once we see the big picture, we realize they
weren't really random after all.  
  
If God orchestrated evolution to bring about humans, then it wouldn't actually
be natural selection that did it. It would be a situation more analogous to
human breeding, what Darwin called ""artificial selection,"" but far more
elaborate.  
  
When it comes to breeding, we don't say that natural selection isn't blind,
but rather that *actual* selection is occurring. The same would apply here.
Natural selection would arguably still be occurring as well (as it is in
human-bred animals), but it would not be the explanation for why things turned
out as they did.  
  
One implication would be that if you were to seed life an another habitable
planet, one where God was NOT orchestrating the creation of human beings, not
much would happen evolutionarily, because natural selection in and of itself
doesn't explain function.",1720

I cannot speak for Ed, but I was not arguing for or against natural selection
per se. I disentangle truth and natural selection, as science, through my idea
that, since a random sequence is a valid image of God, and since we know
through quantum mechanics that there is such a thing as a random sequence, a
random sequence, being without rules, is a very simple image of God, who also
is without rules.  
  
But God is greater than this or any other image, and is in no way limited by
this image. So questions about consciousness do not restrict this image. What
it is useful for, to we humans, is to show that we cannot calculate, with our
mathematical science, what God's acts will be or are, since we cannot
calculate a number (a sequence) whose digits are without a rule (are random),
and, since God is truth, this separates truth from natural selection. In
short, it is beyond our understanding (at least for me) to know whether
natural selection is actual science, although as a theory of science, as Ed
said in the video, (""natural selection favors fitness"") it explains adaption
to the environment of survivors.  
  
I can't see how your question can give a different answer without assumption,

1\. You're right. Historical science is highly speculative. Lots of these

years ago and which have left a very weak trace. It's very difficult for us
humans to do forensic science with things in the present and there's always
room for (sometimes) grave mistakes. So reconstruing things that happened this
long ago is an almost impossible task. Some evolutionary ""science"" consists
for example in people who find a tooth and then make a ""reconstruction"" of the
whole body plan of the animal, its environment and behavior. It's funny

"To illustrate this general point, he offers as an example the interrogative
sentence “Why do things happen?” There is, he says, no possible answer to
this, and so it is not a genuine question. Now, I don’t think this is actually
a good example, because it seems to me that there is a plausible
interpretation of this interrogative sentence on which it amounts to a real
question susceptible of an answer. For example, it might be interpreted as
asking why the world is such that _change_ occurs in it, rather than being
static in the way Parmenides and Zeno took it to be. And an answer would be
Aristotle’s view that substances have _potentialities_ as well as actualities,
and that change occurs because these potentials are sometimes actualized.",748
"Goff’s and Frankish’s conversation with Chomsky ends with a brief discussion
of matters of politics and economics. Chomsky says that the excesses of 1920s

eventually to a somewhat more humane form of capitalism by the 50s and 60s.
Then, he thinks, Reagan and Thatcher turned the world back in the direction of
something like the 1920s kind of capitalism. But, he suggests, something like

it to the hard problem of consciousness, arguing that solving it is probably
beyond our cognitive capacities.",421
"Another problem he has with the recent literature, he says, is that he thinks
that conscious and unconscious mental phenomena are so deeply intermingled
that he doubts that we can extract the former out and still be left with a
coherent picture. He gives the example of uttering a certain sentence in the
course of a conversation. Obviously a person who does this is conscious, but
the decision to utter the sentence is not _itself_ conscious in the same way
that, say, a runner might consciously decide to start running when he hears
the starting pistol. (The example is mine, not Chomsky’s.) The runner might
have the explicit thought “Time to go!” but the speaker doesn’t think “Time to

I'm sorry if the topic/questions that I put on the table were repetitive or

they're a bunch of commies and half-baked intellectuals when it comes to
anything that detours from politics that they ''know a lot''. In short, I
don't have anyone to talk about that kind of thing. There are a lot of other
questions that I can't even find materials to work with (all I have is some of
Ed's books and the articles that David Oderberg gives for free on his website,
and still there are a lot of things that I just can't understand right because
it's hard to grasp). So I just want to say that I appreciate a lot of you guys
time and effort - that means a lot to me.  
  
The topic of natural selection and evolution generally opens up a lot of other
questions - questions that mere biologists, say, can't answer in principle.
The examples that I brought up about counting cells as individuals it's
something that was really puzzling me. Of course, as I said I think that's
insane. If cells we're conjoined to survive in the first place why do a lot of
them have to die every day for the sake of others if the 'plan' was just for
the single cell to survive in the first place? Why do we have apoptosis and
the like? Or worse, like I said some comments ago replying to Tom, why do the
'true individuals' (the cells) come to form up 'the illusion' of a single
individual? It means that the dog we see every day that 'seems' to rely on and
works in unity with his own parts as a single thing to chase down the bikers
across the street is just an aggregate of individual cells. That's not just
disturbing I think that it's evil to think something like that.  
  
As you guys can see I'm not a pro in biology. That's why I rely so much on the
''armchair'' philosophy. I can see that it is problematic to say that cells
are individuals but I don't have a 'biological argument' (whatever that means)
to affirm that. But the point is what is the motivation behind that 'science

Naturalists say that when brains reach a certain level of ""complexity"", they
become conscious (something ""emerges""). And what does that mean? That's just
the process of **eduction of the substantial form from the potentialities of
prime matter,** described by Aquinas 700+ years ago.  
  
That means that the forms (ADN) are in the potency of prime matter (chemicals)
and are then drawn out into act through the agency of the efficient cause (the
powers existing in the environment). Once you reach the ""threshold of
complexity"", the form appears and so do the new properties and powers, like
being self-conscious and being capable of abstract thinking.  
  
So naturalists have reached the same conclusion that St. Thomas did. But St.
Thomas had a coherent, hyper-extense, detailed up to the point of exhaustion

""Evolution"" is the apparition of the immense variety of life forms on Earth.  
  
""Natural Selection"" is the **attempted** ""scientific"" explanation as to why
some things (""forms"") prosper and others do not (for example Fodor's pigs
without wings, or why unicorns or whales with wheels do not exist). ""Natural
Selection"" is the culler of the infinite potentialities existing in chemicals
(matter). ADN would be the forms (species, ""you are allowed to exist and you
are not allowed""). So ""Natural Selection"" is nothing more, nothing less than
Plato's Demiurge or Avicennas's Giver of Forms. Or Aquinas's Pure Actuality
(""whose only bidding matter obeys"").  
  
Which means that ""Natural Selection"" is a god-like entity. So of course they
smuggle powers to it. ""Natural Selection"" is their idol with feet of clay,
which they want to make sound as ""scientific"". But a god by another name a god
is. ""Natural Selection"" is unfalsifiable and therefore reducible to pseudo-
science. The tape of evolution is never going to be replayed.

It's very telling that no matter how much reductionists obsess about, it seems
that life can not be assimilated to non-life. That's why no biologist speaks
of atoms as the basic units of life. It's always the ""cell"" what biologists
speak about. As if the Book of Nature were telling us that we are confronting
two different, irreducible phenomena. That's why we have books about chemistry
and books about ""biochemistry"". As if it were impossible to bridge the gulf
between them in physicalist, step-by-step, gradualistic terms.*  
  
There's this paper that I believe can solve a lot of your doubts regarding the
issue (individuality, wholeness, aggregates, the irreducibility of life...)

*Gradualists have half the story right btw. Progressive, gradual accumulation of accidental changes in prime matter can bring about substantial change. But you need the substantial form. And once the new substantial form is educed, something totally new appears (""emerges"") and quantity becomes now quality (a difference in kind). And after that point, there's no going back. But that jump is something that **can only be grasped by the immaterial intellect,** not by the physical senses alone. That's why we empiricists and dualists can not agree. That's why we fight and obsess about the fossil record. That's why we're at war :)  ",1857

""That something was God. Believe it, Tadeo, God's purpose, ""before the

Yes! I do believe in God. Perhaps, believe is not a good word for what I have
in mind - but something more certain than that i.e I know that GOD IS!  
  
But what I had in mind when formulating the thoughts of my earlier comments is
the fact that I don't think that we need to put God into that question -
that's why I didn't use His name till now. And I think that because it seems
there is something murkier lurking in the way evolution and natural selection
are said to be (not evolution per see but the way the naturalists and co. say
they are).  
  
So, I think that it is possible to make an Aristotelian-fashioned claim
against that based on the facts that we already know. Because I think there
must be something wrong with what they say and that on Aristotelian grounds we
can prove that. But again, I'm not a philosopher, I'm just a 24-year-old
Brazilian so I'm not in any position to affirm that - I just think that it's
possible.  
  
That's why I thought of bringing up that question and seeing what Ed or other

fundamental to learn about.

"Labeleing something a ""pseudo-problem"" to be resolved by language seems to be
a classic move by those trying to preserve a place for pure armchair
philosophy without risking trespassing upon the sacred realm of science.
Basically, it means they don't have a solution and they can't think of
anything that resembles a solution, so obviously the ""pseudo-problem"" must be
to blame, and not their philosophical preconceptions.  
  
Mysterianism is, of course, intellectual suicide. If we accept that some area
of knowledge exists where our reasoning faculties would simply come up short,
we have no reason to believe that we have not already arrived at that point.

"Interestingly, Chomsky himself does not take that view. Indeed, in his
exchange with Goff and Frankish, he suggests that the so-called hard problem
is really a pseudo-problem. He points out that the fact that we can form an
interrogative sentence does not by itself entail that it expresses a genuine
question. With some interrogatives, there may be no possible way to answer
them, and in that case, he says, we’re not dealing with a genuine question.",451
"Perhaps Chomsky would take all of this too to be suspect, but it would be
better to have a less tendentious example to illustrate his general point. And
that’s not hard to find. We could, altering another example famously given by
Chomsky, consider the interrogative sentence “Why do colorless green ideas
sleep furiously?” _That_ clearly is something to which there is no possible
answer, and it suffices to support Chomsky’s point that not every
interrogative corresponds to a genuine question.",496

Aristotle, who already had a concept of God, although incomplete, and end up
at the scholastics and Aquinas, who definitely posits God as the unmoved mover

you may successfully avoid mentioning God in this seeking after an answer, but
I cannot help but think that your answer, all the same, will be shot through

Frankish of illusionism, where Goff characterizes these, respectively, as the
view that consciousness is everywhere and the view that consciousness is
nowhere. (This might be a bit of an overstatement in the case of Frankish’s

I believe that our existence was purposely orchestrated by God and that
science cannot prove or disprove it, because randomness is far simpler than

prima facie discrete data, but the simplification into statements is as far as
it can go. A statement obviously has a specific order. It is not random and
cannot be further compressed and retain intelligibility. A random process
could have come up with the statement or, far more likely, gibberish.  
  
This is not in any way anti-scientific.  
  
To put it in terms, not of statements, but of the actual result in the
physical environment, the theory based on random mutation and natural
selection does not have in it a pointer to which of the almost unimaginably
large number of results today that it could have led to.

"Feser writes: ""Now, I sympathize with Chomsky’s view that the so-called hard
problem of consciousness is a pseudo-problem. As I said in my exchange with
Goff, I would say that the problem arises only if we follow Galileo and his
early modern successors in holding that color, odor, sound, heat, cold, and
other “secondary qualities” do not really exist in matter in the way common
sense supposes them to, but instead exist only in the mind (as the qualia of
conscious experience) and are projected by us onto external reality. If you
take this position, you are stuck with a conception of matter that makes it
impossible to regard consciousness as material. The solution, I would say, is
simply not to go along with this assumption in the first place, but to return
to the Aristotelian-Scholastic view the early moderns reacted against, and
which is compatible with the commonsense view of matter. The so-called hard
problem of consciousness then dissolves.""  
  
But per Chalmers: ""The “hard problem” is explaining why any of the neural
processes in question are associated with conscious awareness, given that it
seems at least prima facie possible that they could do what neuroscience
describes them as doing in the complete absence of consciousness.""  
  
I have to cast my lot with Chalmers: that's a real hard problem! How does that
neural activity have any-intelligible-thing to do with consciousness? (And
also, how does the lack of any relevant explanatory bridge theory have
anything to do with Galileo??)",1515
"Now, Russell argued that what we know best is consciousness itself, and that
everything else we know, including physics, is derivative from this. He also
held, again, that physics tells us about the abstract mathematical structure
of matter, but not about its intrinsic nature. But if we suppose that
consciousness is identical to properties of the brain, then it would follow
that introspection gives us knowledge about the intrinsic nature of at least
one material object, namely the brain itself. And this might give us a basis
for extrapolating about the intrinsic nature of the material world in general.",609

 _They say in the text that the microorganisms that formed the mitochondria
were separable in principle - at least they suppose it is that way._  
  
Granting the premise that the theory of endosymbiosis is true, it does nothing
to invalidate A-T metaphysics and a lot to support it. I'll go for this: those
microorganismos were substances at first ( _per se subsistens_ ), capable of
""independent"" life and then merged. A new organism (substantial form) emerged
(new species). The mitochondria would remain there virtually, until through
accidental changes it could no longer re-gain (in a natural manner) its
independence, becoming an obligate intracellular organelle. (But maybe it
could in a laboratory in presence of human beings with adequate technology).  
  
2 questions for the darwinian: what does the environment in which a
mitochondrion lived prior to the fusion had to do with the intracellular
environment in which it found itself after the fusion?? If organisms adapt to
their niches, the extracellular life of the mitochondrial organism would have
had very little in common with the metabolic machinery of the cytoplasm of the
host. Of course these people can elaborate an unfalsifiable nice just-so sory
about how it did happen and the ""powers"" of Natural Selection,* but that's
garbage science and should not be tolerated.  
  
For the A-T proponent, the prime matter had ""silent"" potentialities that got
activated under the circumstances of the fusion (for example metabolical
accomodation that did not disrupt the life of any of the symbionts).  
  
*If they try the ""but there were lots of trial-error attempts and then one worked"", then they are admitting that there is (was) a tendency, for certain types of microorganisms, to co-join so new environments can be tried after that. And not a ""single point mutation or error in the DNA replication machinery"" or any other of the silly non-sense these people claim. An tendencies = natures = teleology = Aristotle.

intrinsic nature. But at the same time, the Cartesian idea of the mind as the
repository of qualities that cannot be given a mechanical or mathematical
analysis remains. Hence, Chomsky concludes, what contemporary philosophy and

of the standard assumption, after Ryle, that modern science leaves us with the
machine and has exorcised the ghost.",727

selection argument here] in different periods of times and because they are
made of cells - that really 'work' as individuals - are co-opted to do what
they do. So, in fact, what they are saying is that we are just an aggregate!
And that sounds odd.  
  
And when we come to measure all this (presupposing again all of this is right)

opted' to form a leg, say, or an organ - that is, to serve a bigger purpose.

sophisticated mathematics.  
  
So much, then, as well for the importance of the idea that all truth can be

so expressed. But then how would mathematics illuminate the difference … as ""A
