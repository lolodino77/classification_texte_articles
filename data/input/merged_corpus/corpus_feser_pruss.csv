4011,"Hi toni. Your comment seems to support mine. You say that, if there is disagreement among the bishops, the only practical infallible organ is a General Council confirmed by the Pope or an ex cathedra statement. However, as I mentioned, such declarations do not merely amount to infallible statements concerning the history of the ordinary magisterium of the bishops. They do rely on tradition, of course, but the cruncher in any infallible declaration is that it is part of the faith revealed by God, as Pius IX and Pius XII said, immediately prefacing their dogmatic defini-tions. Tradition is the keeping of the faith whose revelation ended with the death of the last Apostle. Obviously the Church cannot lose the faith, but the final arbiter of what that faith is, is the Papacy and General Councils con-firmed by it.

3810,"@ Victor Torley,      We are speaking at opposed purposes, not cross-purposes.      :-)      ""the intrinsic properties of elementary particles (such as quarks and electrons) [...] do not change when particles are bound in a structure""      In quantum mechanics the properties and existence of a particle is known only through observed interactions with other particles and these interactions are certainly different when the particle is bound then it is when it is free, so it is merely semantics whether you call it the same particle or a different particle that is found by probing. It definitely has different properties. ""Intrinsic properties"" are properties with reference to ""self"" and are not directly accessible but are inferred by extrinsic measurement, which changes, as I said, when the probe is into a bound system versus into relatively free particles. A free particle is _potentially_ a bound particle if it can be taken up into the bound system (see that word root ""potential"" there and think of Aquinas when you do).      Another difficulty with your view is explaining how unique particles, like red blood cells (they are not identical), to which quantum mechanics also must apply, could be probed experimentally at all for fit with the laws of quantum mechanics. Red blood cells also exist in superpositions of states, but since each RBC is unique, there is no way to test its interactions for interference.      I spoke of a golf ball being in a different state after being knocked from a tee. Note that the state, when it is flying, is one which it is only potentially in before it is hit. It certainly has different properties which it only potentially had before being sent flying. Get in the way of the flying ball. It hurts, but the ball sitting on the tee doesn't.      Your propositional distributive law is not about intrinsic properties either. Particles behave. They do not do logic calculations with propositions. Your propositional distributive law is something that exists in our minds, not in particles.

4281,"@ Walter Van den Acker,      ""Obviously God only had to obey your logic.""      That is nothing like what I said.      ""I don't avoid challenge,, but real challenge requires real arguments, and I don't see any from you.""      You do avoid challenge and you avoid mine because you can't answer it.      You would first have to understand the consequences of the bitwise XOR operation between a bitwise random sequence and an intelligible sequence. I will start with finite sequences and we can think of them as displayed on a computer screen under some standard protocol that displays sequences of bits as words on a computer screen, or at least it does if the sequence of bits are not such that what is displayed is nonsense. Now I can get a random sequence with 50/50 bits by a physical process. It could actually display as something intelligible but it is not likely.      Let us call this random sequence A. Let us call B an actually intelligible sequence. It consists of meaningful words converted into a sequence of bits so that they will display as the meaningful words when displayed under the standard protocol being used.      It can easily be shown that when a third sequence, C, is created by doing the operation A XOR B -> C, that C is as random as A and is as unlikely as A to display as anything meaningful.      Now, the beginning of a system:      It can also easily be shown that A, B, and C, together, have the property such that any two of them produce the third sequence when the bitwise XOR operation is performed on the other two. Thus:      A XOR B -> C,   B XOR C -> A, and   C XOR A -> B.      As stated above as easily demonstrated, if A is random, then so is C. But we began with a random A and then chose B to be intelligible, so if we XOR the two random sequences (""disordered"" is a better word here than ""random"", but for now I stick with ""random""), we get the intelligible sequence that we purposely chose. Now here is the crux of the beginning of the system:      The random sequence A that we began with cannot, by itself, give us the chosen sequence B. A is random after all. It could have been any similarly random sequence, so if any random sequence could be decoded into the chosen sequence, how could it be decoded into a different chosen sequence had a different one been chosen? If there was some process dependent upon the chosen sequence by which any random sequence could be decoded into the particular chosen sequence, then the chosen sequence would already have to be known before the correct process that works could be used. So the random sequence A cannot have, intrinsic to itself, the information thatispecifies the chosen sequence. Furthermore, since the second random sequence was produced using the XOR operation with the chosen sequence and the chosen sequence could have been _any_ intelligible sequence, we have that a second random sequence C exists for any initial random A and chosen B. For random A there exists a random C that gives B, the intelligible sequence, no matter what intelligible sequence Biwas chosen.      By just guessing at what C happens to be, A XOR C is most likely nonsense, but if it results in an intelligible B, it is very unlikely to be the pre-chosen B. It is in fact as likely as correctly guessing the pre-chosen B from all possible intelligible sequences (this is slightly simplified for clarity).      This is the beginning of a system based on simplicity that will show that God does not have to be ruled by the logic that you, Walter, futilely use to try to impose your own ideas as limits on God.

3286,"Dr. Ed Feser gives a brief rundown of the “error” and condemnation of Pope Honorius I (625-638). He draws mostly from the Patristic scholarship of great Fr. John Chapman who was a remarkable scholar on the early Papacy and the issues related to the Latin vs Byzantine Churches throughout the first seven ecumenical Councils. In my own research, I have come to think that Fr. Chapman’s is perhaps the best sketch and explanation of the events surrounding Honorius. There can be no question that Pope St. Leo II, the very Pope who confirmed the decrees of the Council of Constantinople III (681), that is, the very council which had accused Pope Honorius of heresy, believed that his predecessor Honorius had committed a heresy. There can be no question that, including Constantinople III, three more ecumenical synods repeated the anathema against Honorius for heresy. Moreover, in the Roman Breviary, up until the 18th century, included a description of Honorius as a “heretic” for June 28th, the feast of the Pope who executed Honorius’s condemnation (St. Leo II). There also can be no question that these Councils, Popes, theologians, canonists, and general Christian thinkers understood Honorius as a heretic. Though, you have some exceptions.      One thing that Feser does not venture deeply into is the question of what kind of “heretical crime” was proven at the Council in 681 over Honorius, a man who had died 42 years prior to its convocation. At best, Honorius can be convicted of material heresy since the form added to the matter of heresy has to be proven. Moreover, since the doctrine of two-wills in Christ was not definitively settled, even a material heresy in this regard (according to Catholicism’s developed canon law) could not, of itself, situate one into the canonical crime of heresy nor the status of mortal sin. Otherwise, we would have to anathematize the person and memory of St Thomas Aquinas for his rejection of the Immaculate Conception. But that is impossible since Pope Sixtus condemned anyone who would accuse another for mortal sin or canonical heresy when the matter had not yet been resolved by the Apostolic See. While the Council of Constantinople III cannot be said to have worked with these parameters, those parameters did become standard and acceptable to Catholic canon law, jurisprudence, and pastoral theory. It is practical today.      What lessons, asks Feser, can be drawn from Honorius for us today? I think the most that can be drawn is that a Pope can commit a doctrinal error. But that a Pope could become teach heresy and thereby become a formal heretic is not illustrated by the Honorius-event. One might argue that the Honorius-event lends great precedent that such a thing could, in theory, happen. But there is nothing in the Honorius-event, according to developed Catholic beliefs on the nature of heresy and its criminality, that illustrates that precedent. Now, if we revert back to the standards of the Latin and Greek policies during the 7th century, then it is a foregone conclusion, a Pope can become a formal heretic. But it seems to me that we cannot ignore the canonical, theological, and pastoral developments that have taken place since Honorius to the present day.      For a more relevant historical context wherein a Pope committed an error while in office, coupling form and matter (but perhaps not pertinacity), you would have to study the Three Chapters controversy under Emperor Justinian regarding the Constituta of Pope Vigilius.      PS. For the life of me, when I read Honorius’s letters, my own private judgment does not see him as a true Monothelite.

Here too Bellarmine suggests that one strategy to defend Honorius would be to propose that the relevant passages from the council proceedings were faked, and inserted by enemies of Rome.

Alternatively, Bellarmine suggests, perhaps the council really did condemn Honorius, but did so under the mistaken assumption that he was a heretic. This is not a problem, Bellarmine says, because a council can be mistaken about a historical (as opposed to doctrinal) matter. But even if the council had been mistaken about Honorius, in condemning him it was teaching that popes can (when not speaking _ex cathedra_ ) be guilty of heresy, and _that is_ a doctrinal matter.

So if one says a house is like the architect who designed it, we say that the house exists pre-eminently as an image in the mind of the architect, and he creates his observable plan drawings from the unobservable image in his mind and the house is built from these drawings by his agent, the carpenter. So the house is an image of the architect. This is straight out of Aquinas.      In the same way, I can specify a model, or image, of God. The model exists pre-eminently in God and is like Him, even though it is just me who specifies the model. God is not limited by the limitations of the model, but what can be shown in the model exists pre-eminently in God.      The model, or likeness, is an infinite unbiased binary sequence of 50/50 bits. All finite subsequences exist within this infinite sequence. If the consecutive binary digits are each 50/50, then the infinite sequence is a normal sequence. Even so, any subsequence of specified finite length could be missing a particular sub-sub-sequence of itself because such a subsequence itself must appear normally within the infinite sequence. Therefore, discovery by bitwise examination of a subsequence of finite length, no matter how long, that misses a particular sub-sub-sequence cannot be a demonstration that the infinite sequence is not normal.      A description of finite space and time is encoded by a finite subsequence of the infinite normal sequence. A computer that can run the subsequence as a program, including memory, could virtually reproduce all that we experience of reality, given the finite resolution of our senses in time and space. We would not be able to tell whether a missing sub-sub-sequence would exist further along in time in which the rules of arithmetic are no longer what they were. Since the infinite sequence is of random bits, the rules of arithmetic really are not rules. They have just appeared to be rules by random chance. The model, as explained, does not specify God or God's will. So we cannot say from the model whether God could change what appeared to be rules of arithmetic into completely different rules where 128 is not a power of 2 and 127 is a composite number.

3324,"(continued from previous 2 posts)      With this in mind, take the question now to the issue of future Popes making judgments about the views of previous popes. As Vatican I notes, we might ask if a future Pope could override the judgment of a previous Pope as to whether that previous view was indeed heretical or not. Indeed, this might even hold to the previous Pope's own views. BUT, it is still hard to see how one could judge that the previous pope was FORMALLY heretical, since he presumably would not have taken his own view to be heretical. Could a future pope judge that a previous pope really did know his view to be heretical, etc.?      This raises some very thorny issues indeed. It seems to me that this could not occur because as I understand it, part of the process of declaring someone a formal heretic is that the person is confronted by the authority with a judgment of heresy, and obstinately persists in his views. Obviously, this cannot happen for someone who is deceased.      Another difficulty of course is that if we say future popes can override the judgment of prior popes, then we would also have to hold that an even later pope could override THAT judgment, and so on. BUT, given that we hold that Popes are bound by magisterial teaching, one might ask how this could happen. Or, are popes bound only by magisterial teaching, and not by all previous magisterial juridical decisions, etc.? If we hold that juridical judgments are not infallible (even if they are authoritative in their time), then it seems one could, in theory, later remove the anathemas of Honorius, or whatever. (It certainly seems in other cases a future pope could override earlier papal juridical decisions--e.g., we can conceive of a person excommunicated being reinstated in the church by a future pope, and so on--does this change when the decisions are concretized in conciliar declarations, etc.? Important questions--to be continued, one final segment....).

4040,"The Church was deliberate at Vatican I. It did not extend infallibility further than it did; nor did it make its definition exclusive. That the Pope’s table talk can never have the same weight as his ex cathedra statements is obvious. Ex cathedra statements and General Councils are about letting us know what we must assent to. Traditionally-minded Catholics generally distinguish when this assent is required, and when the Pope is being foolish.      The assertion that Popes can therefore err on faith and morals when not speaking ex cathedra being possible in principle is not Church teaching but a matter of opinion, the likelihood of which could be argued about in terms of probabilities, not certitudes. The mechanical repetition of this opinion makes things simpler for some, but it is not Church teaching.      Ott’s manual had this to say about one historical issue: “On the Honorius question, let it be remarked that Pope Honorius I was personally orthodox. However, through his prohibition against speaking of two modes of operation, he unwittingly favoured the Monothelite error. The Sixth General Council wrongly condemned him as a heretic. Pope Leo II confirmed the anathematisation but did not adopt the ground given by the Council. He did not reproach him with heresy but with negligence in the suppression of error” (Christology. Para. 13). The Church can infallibly indicate what propositions are heretical and where they are textually located. The council condemning Pope Honorius did not indicate where his “heresy” was located. Its mistake on historical fact was not confirmed by the Pope. No council without the Pope is infallible.      What Pope Innocent III affirmed (“Peter’s successors will never at any time deviate from the Catholic faith…) has stood the test of time. The other statement referring to sinning against the faith and being judged for it is not the same thing as leaving the faith, in the sense that Pope Innocent and Vatican I meant by that.      This issue can’t be separated from Vatican I and its affirmation that the Roman See cannot fail in the faith. It’s not a straw man. Obviously, through ex cathedra infallibility, the Church has a guarantee of a rule of faith. But the notion that, apart from this, the Pope could be a kind of Calvin (albeit an invincibly ignorant one) or even a real Calvin, stretches the limits of credibility. We’re back to Balaam’s talking ass.      There haven’t been any heretical Popes in the past (material or formal), and there aren’t any now, strictly speaking – the only manner that counts. That Popes have, in a practical way, and through negligence, weakness and tendentiousness caused massive amounts of damage would amount to Pope Innocent’s idea of sinning against the faith, justifying an angry reaction from the Church. I think that, with the clear movement by some conservatives to leave the Church on the pretext that the papacy has abandoned the faith (this blog has alluded to bishops who are “flirting with schism”), we ought to emphasise how wrong their hypothesis is. Countering it with the notion of a Church, and a promise of Christ, not fundamentally overturned by a potentially heretical Papacy, because it’s only bound to be infallible occasionally, will not convince such people.   I don’t say this is your view of the Church, Dr. Feser, but I think that every time we talk about the limits of papal infallibility we ought to remind people that all Popes have a personal promise that they will not renounce the faith, and that this promise has been honoured.

881,"@Walter   An agent has a range of actions that can be actualized for some given scenario (which provides the common intelligibility for the range of these actions). Since the range considered in itself is indeterminate (and the scenario is indifferent towards any one such action) the agent particularizes out of that range to get an actual action. The particularization itself is sui generis and only exists with some volition itself.      To answer your question more directly, action A and action B are analogous to each other with respect to the scenario in question. If the scenario is for instance that one needs to survive, then the actions ""drink water"" and ""eat food"" can both be said to ensure survival, but in different ways. Since neither of these has commanding power until they are realized, the agent is really open to both.      As such, if you were somehow able to run simulations of this, you would see the agent sometimes ""drink water"", other times ""eat food"".      @RunDec   I think it does, though I will get to what I think is a more core issue that I think you are getting at.      Volitional causation is not univocal. Because it is not univocal, you can have different actions with no intrinsic difference across the agent (until after the action is done). Moreover, ""X"" and ""Y"" do not have any actual individual reality until actually caused.

Everyone's intent for the game is to (eventually) have the truth come out. I would call this a global intent **for** the truth. And everyone AGREES to the method of the game, which is to tell untruths about specific elements, but NOT to tell untruths about whether X is or is not according to the rules - so it's not an unlimited writ to lie.

1010,"Walter      This awe and fear of being in God’s presence is not something he inspires, it’s His infinite greatness perceived by a finite creature. It’s the shock of reality unveiled. From behind the veil, at times He spills over such that we can experience a diluted form of His presence where words like gentle, tender, love, peace etc are used. For now we only see dimly, our perception is naturally tuned to dim reality, and so it’s in this diluted form that most of us can distinguish anything other than infinite ‘brightness’.      In general you take a position that conflicts with everything revealed in scripture. So where do you get your information on what God is, what God could do and couldn’t do? If it’s just reason, then what makes you think you can understand the timeless and the infinite? We can’t even think without time. If you ignore revelation, what makes you think humans are able to understand such things any more than ants can understand Special Relativity?      When Jesus Bar Joseph was convicted, Pilate gave the people the option to choose between him and Jesus Barabbas (“son of the father”). Two messianic figures representing two different human perspectives, one human, one divine. Peter originally saw Jesus as the human version, and Jesus responded with “Get thee behind me Satan”.      This is made clearer by the three temptations that Jesus was given in the desert. Satan did not ask for worship, as he is more sly than that. He presented different versions of this human perspective, which relate to suffering, power, and image (being liked or admired). Satan even quotes scripture, the master theologian using scripture to sell the human perspective.      This is what spiritual discernment is all about. You can use Ignatian exercises to help with this, you can go on silent retreat (even into the desert). You can go to weekly mass and a weekly holy hour in silence.

2238,"Walter      ""Of course there is a difference in my intrinsic properties between w1 and w2. Otherwise there is no reason why I choose X over ~X.   The cause of my choosing X in w1 is me with my intention to choose X, which is an intrinsic property.   You are describing a random process instead of a choice.""      No, Walter, there is no intrinsic difference if LFW is true, and this is precisely how there can be a libertarian free choice. Otherwise the presence of you + the intention would determine the resulting action and we would no longer have libertarian freedom. If the cause were you and the intention, then in order to preserve libertarian freedom you would have to cause your intention. But then to cause your intention you would end up in an infinite regress, unless you accept that you at t in state S can cause Intention (what it does in w1) or not cause it (what it does in w2). In other words: there is no difference in intrinsic properties in the agent in worlds 1 and 2, and yet the agent can cause X or ~X. See? That's my point.      There is literally no difference between humans and God when it comes to this weird aspect of libertarian freedom. For determinism to be avoided, it must be the case that someone at t in state S can cause both X or ~X. For our libertarian choice of X, there is a time t which is the earliest time with the property that after t it is no longer causally possible for us to choose ~X instead. How else do you think libertarian freedom could work, without determinism? If the choice follows a difference in intrinsic properties, then the choice would be determined by such a difference and thus would no longer be libertarian, lest we cause the difference in properties (the intention, say), but then the same problem would reappear.      You say that this is ""random"". That is a common accusation by those who *reject* libertarian freedom. I do not accept that it is random; I believe libertarian choice is a sui generis category that is neither random nor deterministic, but that is beside the point. My response was that the ""problem"" Vincent was pointing out doesn't just affect Divine Simplicity, but also libertarian freedom for humans. It is THE SAME THING for us. The issue there doesn't lie with classical theism, but LFW; LFW by itself requires that an agent can be able to (non-randomly) bring about different effects without there being any change in the intrinsic properties of the agent when it is choosing.      So if you have a problem with God choosing to cause different things without requiring any difference in intrinsic properties as a condition for that, you should also have a problem with libertarian freedom for humans. Which you probably do (you probably do not accept LFW). Vincent however does presumably accept LFW, so he has to choose between rejecting LFW altogether or dropping that objection.      The only difference between us and God in this case is you could argue that our intrinsic properties change *after* we have CHOSEN (not when we are choosING). But so what? It is not even clear to me that we must change intrinsically after we have chosen; why insist that this must happen universally, even with God? It would still be the case that for a libertarian free choice to be made, the cause need not incur in change, since the cause can indeed, under the same exact intrinsic properties, bring about different effects.

This hermeneutic even led him gently to criticize the direction the hierarchy had taken the Church in recent decades. Though very much a man of Vatican II, he thought _Gaudium et Spes_ too optimistic about the modern world. He had reservations about Pope John Paul II’s interreligious prayer meeting in Assisi in 1986.

3181,"I am glad we agree on the subject of heresy, and retract my comment that you were incorrect on that point.      But your point about the Council still does not stand. They were in fact making a *historical* claim in judging Honorius guilty of heresy. Councils can be incorrect about historical claims. You say this:       _First, the reason a council condemns someone as a heretic is because of his teaching. Hence it is, first and foremost, Honorius’s teaching that was condemned. That means that the teaching was judged heretical. But whether a teaching is heretical is a doctrinal matter, and not a mere historical matter. Now, given that a papally-approved council cannot err on doctrinal matters, it follows that the councils in question infallibly judged that Honorius’s teaching was heretical (whatever his intentions). But since anyone who teaches heresy is a heretic, it follows (at least given that Honorius really did write the letters that got him into trouble, as most of his defenders concede) that these councils did after all infallibly judge that Honorius was a heretic._      This does not follow. The councils judged that *monotheilitism was a heresy*, which is completely true. They then made the historical claim that *Honorius was a heretic*, which is not protected by any infallible charism whatsoever. The key point protected by infallibility is not that Honorius was a heretic; it's that monothelitism is a heresy. Whether or not Honorius actually taught monthelitism cannot be established merely by the council's say-so. That simply is not a doctrinal claim.      You then say this:       _Second, the reason most of Honorius’s defenders try to defend him is to avoid having to acknowledge that a pope can teach heresy when not speaking ex cathedra. Now, suppose that the councils did indeed get it wrong when judging that Honorius, specifically, was a heretic. Since that is a historical rather than doctrinal matter, such an error is possible. Still, by making this judgment, the councils also taught by implication that it is possible for a pope to teach heresy (when not speaking ex cathedra). And that is a doctrinal matter. That is enough to refute the larger claim that Honorius’s defenders are trying to uphold by defending him._      A Pope can speak heresy, potentially; a Pope cannot teach heresy in the capacity of utilizing his magisterial authority to bind the faithful to religious assent of will, because then the Magisterium would be leading the faithful off the path of salvation. And as you happily acknowledge, what the councils were condemning as heresy is not the understanding that Vatican I used and is in fact not sinful, because monothelitism had yet to be condemned directly in a Church council or by an authoritative papal teaching.      Also, I am supremely unconvinced that a private letter can ever be an act of Magisterial teaching in any case, and not simply the private opinion of the man who happened to be Pope.      Also you say this:       _Wright neglects to mention the opinion of St. Francis de Sales, who, when addressing papal authority in The Catholic Controversy, says that “we do not say that the Pope cannot err in his private opinions, as did John XXII, or be altogether a heretic, as perhaps Honorius was” (p. 225)._      Wright ""neglected to mention"" him because St. Francis De Sales is clearly not condemning Honorius, merely mentioning in passing that he PERHAPS was a heretic.

Now this leaves me with some questions. Now keep in mind that if you try to communicate back, I will not understand as I have not seen your Truman show. However, since you have seen mine, I know that you will understand the points I am driving at by my questions. This will give you some food for thought while you are in your cage.      The first question is: could you tell us what study has identified the three movements of the intellect (understanding, judgement, syllogism) with particular elements on the periodic table? And, which elements are associated with which movement? And if not elements, perhaps compounds? If so, which compounds are associated with which movements? And is it that the compound has to be located in the person, or in the brain, or in a particular place in the brain at a particular time to have a particular thought? And if the compound present in one person when they think that thought, how do you know that this compound is *causing* the thought? Or are you identifying it with the thought? And how do you know it does not merely correspond with the thought rather than causing it or being identified with it? And if it were causing the thought or identified with it in *this person* how do you know that the same occurs in all people? If a certain element, compound, or process is associated with a thought in person A, how do you know that this occurs in all people in the world? And if it does not occur with all people in the world, how can you reduce understanding of some concept or some judgement with a particular element, compound or process?      These are just a few questions for you to chem on in your cage. Given how important evidence is to you, I am sure that you have evidential answers to all of these questions. If not, that would again show you to be a complete hypocrite and from your posts and our interaction, I know that this cannot be so....      Or perhaps you would tell us that you know none of the answers to these questions and that we just need to trust you that you are correct anyways. Well, given your omniscience about the upbringing of everyone on here that you interact with, that makes all the sense in the world.

A essencial part of this christian theodicy* is that God has a relation with morality totally diferent than our own, see for instance the fact that He can judge people, can kill people, can pester people until they want to do His thing(see Jonah) etc. The Book of Job lets this clear when God finally appears, for Job is trying to tread God as a equal the whole time, who needs to explain His actions to him and all that, and when He finally appears He makes very clear that Job treatment of Him as how we would do a normal person is completely ridiculous.      So the idea that God is good yes but on a more analogical than univocal way is not a clever apologetical invention but is there on the religions of the book since the beginning. It just sounds bizarre to me to see someone argue otherwise, specially when the ""the names Scripture uses to talk of God should not be understood as exactly what they mean in us"" is a thing since the church fathers.

2436,"Walter      “ No, suffering is not a necessary part of our creation unless your claim is that the fall was necessary.   The point of the Fall is that man and not God is responsible for the Fall, but nobody can be responsible for a necessary truth. that would be like saying you are responsible for why 1 + 1 = 2.”      Again, I think this is treating spiritual truth a bit like Newton’s laws of motion. The fall is a spiritual fall, it’s when spiritual death first appeared. Death can be seen as disintegration, but the modern, protestant, literalist mind always assumes this to be physical. Do you really think no creatures died before Adam and Eve ate the fruit?      Remember also that Lucifer fell from heaven before Adams fall. There is a far larger canvas here than just Adam and Eve eating something. Creating free, rational beings seems to inevitably result in at least some of them failing in terms if pride, and therefore obedience. If it’s not inevitable, it’s at least the case in Gods perfect plan for creation.      I do however also think that the fall was necessary at some point. We are each created unique. Some of us are like the prodigal son, and some more like his brother. There are lessons the Father wants both types to learn as part of the process of our creation that is this life. Without the ‘fall’ of the prodigal son, there is no opportunity for either brother to make the right choice to align with the father. Just as the creation of our bodies was via a process of ongoing refinement through suffering, our reconciliation with God is a partaking in the redemptive suffering of God as son of man. It’s of course true that man caused our fall. But God’s plan, from a perspective we can’t even imagine yet, is perfect. Nothing has gone wrong. Bizarre as that may seem to us at times in the middle of it, I believe this to be true.

2669,"You want full message, fine here.   -I read your ""The experience of God"" book twice and I have some questions regarding it.   First is a minor nitpick (And I mean no offence for saying this) but I feel you have a tendency to use too many $10 words. Case in point; you use the word ""quotidian"" at least 5 times that I can remember, when that word is almost never better than its friendly companions ""daily"", ""everyday"", ""ordinary"", and ""commonplace"". Now having a large vocabulary isn't a bad thing, but a flagrant use of obscure words made it very difficult to understand your point.   My second problem is your concept of God and how you define it. Your definition of God is that in trying to elevate Him to the loftiest heights, heights truly befitting the magnificence of God, I feel you have reduced Him to empty concepts/platitudes, both completely meaningless and as uninspiring as mathematical axioms. What could it mean to say God is existence, or consciousness, or bliss, or any of the other abstract concepts that one often hears thrown about by other religious believers: love, truth, the alpha and the omega, and so on? One might as well argue that God is electricity, gravity, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Of course, this would be ludicrous. Who would seek ecstatic union with the weak nuclear force, or pray to electricity, or find solace in the presence of gravity? But slap a poetic, inspirational-sounding abstraction on God (being, truth, beauty, etc.), and suddenly the whole thing gains a veneer of credibility it hasn't earned.   The meaninglessness of your idea of God culminates in your assertion that God must be simple, unable to “possess distinct parts, or even distinct properties” (p.128), and, as eternal, He can’t be subject to change either (time being a measure of change – not to mention the fact that change indicates a movement from potentiality to actuality, whereas God is pure actuality (another meaningless concept)). What can possibly be left over after one has removed distinct parts/properties and the ability to change?   Lastly you defend all of this by claiming that any other way of thinking about God is guilty of anthropomorphism; the tendency to re-make God in our own image and likeness. The charge of anthropomorphism is undeniably valid when people try to convince us that a being even the tiniest bit like what you describe, God cares about what you do in the privacy of your own bedroom, or desires human worship, or takes sides favouring one equally petty, narrow- minded tribe over another, but it is far from obvious that the claim that God isn’t subject to change or lacks distinguishing properties fares any better. The problem here is to explain how this God can be as transcendent as you claim and yet not dissolve into meaningless abstractions. Unfortunately, to the extent that you attempt this impossible task, all you do is appeal to even more meaninglessness propositions. If God can’t change, He must therefore be unfeeling and unable to be aware of contingent truths, you argue?   Hart: It’s just that “his knowledge or bliss or love does not involve any metaphysical change in him” (p.137). God therefore can’t act in the world, nor can He be free, you say?   Hart: God’s “creative intention… can be understood as an eternal act that involves no temporal change within him. His freedom… [consists in] the infinite liberty with which he manifests himself in the creation he wills from everlasting.” (p.139)  ",want full message fine -i read experience god book twice question regarding first minor nitpick mean offence saying feel tendency use many word case point use word quotidian least time remember word almost never better friendly companion daily everyday ordinary commonplace large vocabulary bad thing flagrant use obscure word made difficult understand point second problem concept god define definition god trying elevate loftiest height height truly befitting magnificence god feel reduced empty conceptsplatitudes completely meaningless uninspiring mathematical axiom could mean say god existence consciousness bliss abstract concept one often hears thrown religious believer love truth alpha omega one might well argue god electricity gravity strong weak nuclear force course would ludicrous would seek ecstatic union weak nuclear force pray electricity find solace presence gravity slap poetic inspirational-sounding abstraction god truth beauty etc suddenly whole thing gain veneer credibility earned meaninglessness idea god culminates assertion god must simple unable “ posse distinct part even distinct property ” p eternal subject change either time measure change – mention fact change indicates movement potentiality actuality whereas god pure actuality another meaningless concept possibly left one removed distinct partsproperties ability change lastly defend claiming way thinking god guilty anthropomorphism tendency re-make god image likeness charge anthropomorphism undeniably valid people try convince u even tiniest bit like describe god care privacy bedroom desire human worship take side favouring one equally petty narrow- minded tribe another far obvious claim god subject change lack distinguishing property fare better problem explain god transcendent claim yet dissolve meaningless abstraction unfortunately extent attempt impossible task appeal even meaninglessness proposition god change must therefore unfeeling unable aware contingent truth argue hart “ knowledge bliss love involve metaphysical change ” p god therefore act world free say hart “ creative intention… understood eternal act involves temporal change within freedom… consists infinite liberty manifest creation will everlasting ” p,feser,3487,0

2566,"Splendid! Finally an actual argument.      Let’s recap: your initial claim is that the logical problem of evil provides good philosophical reasons not to believe in the God of classical theism because it shows there is no way to reconcile the bad things that happen to people with “Omni” attributes we want to affirm about God.      A response to this claim was then given that one possible “out” that can preserve these divine attributes by hypothesizing that God could make restitution to the wronged parties in the next life.      You then made a bunch of irrelevant remarks about how everyone who disagrees with you on this topic is stupid, and most people probably gave up on the conversation. But now we actually have a non-trivial and non-circular response! An immortal soul cannot exist that survives after death because we don’t know how a soul interacts with the brain, so it is therefore impossible for God to offer restitution to a person after death.      Now that we have that all our of the way, ready for the philosophy? You sure? Ok here it is:      I reject your premise.

If you take this position, you are stuck with a conception of matter that makes it impossible to regard consciousness as material.

2241,"Hey, can someone explain to me the relation between how Classical Theism God - Our Father - is Omniscient and our free will? Because there is a lot of discussion on that, people who argue about that - at least the ones I saw - are not Classical Theists so it's difficult to find answers about that in their worldview.      I ask that because (some) interpretations of it may turn the world and its residents in an occasionalist manner i.e if God knows what I do and knows that I couldn't do otherwise. I think that sounds odd because somewhat implies a difficulty for freedom - and we can't forget the fact that we are contingent and not necessary beings. But at the same time, if God knows necessarily contingent truths how can they be otherwise? How can we have the freedom to change our minds and somewhat our 'destiny' (pardon for the expression) between doing good or bad if God already knows *ahead* of us? (p.s not that I personally believe that that's the case, it is just how I see people arguing and I found these points legitimate questions, at least).

2497,"(Cont)      Of course, you can argue that the Christian God is evil either according to Christianity own view of goodness or a diferent view of goodness that is taken to be objective.      I'am taking care of arguing against the view that God can be seen as evil on the christian own standards but i admit that this is not much because you clearly take a diferent view on goodness, seeing your argumentation and being a vegetarian, so you could aways reply ""yea, this god is not evil if we accept a wrong definition of good"". I suppose that this is why you say that apologists are changing the definition if goodness.      On the christian view, God can be said to do good to us not only in giving us the chance of Heaven but even in creating we as imperfect as we are. Even existing badly is better that not existing for being is intrinsically good. Now, the zoo example and your vegetarianism* show that you disagree with this, i suppose that being is not good to you on every situation or case and, living on a world were suffering is so prevalescent, i can see were this come from, it is a judgment impossible to never make at least for a moment while living under the sun.      So i think that i see the source of the disagreement here: you and the christian tradition have diferent views on goodness that change the perception of this world and the judgment of Goodness Itself making it. To agree with the christian message you would need a radical change on value that the christian tradition(at least on your view) need way more evidence to justify.      Anyway, i hope that at least i could make the christian response i'am defending appear less ad hoc, for i do see it as being internally coherent.

3262,"@ Laudator Temporis Acti,      (continuation)      The following is just a sample of the part of the random subsequence that describes physical reality as we sense it in which, tomorrow, say, 128 ceases to be a power of 2 and 127 becomes composite. It is klutzy because it is just my idea. The klutziness of my idea and the subsequence describing the future are just of me and the model. They therefore do not limit God to a klutzy technique for causing this cchange. In God, the situation where 128 is prime and 127 is prime, is beautiful. And remember, this is a simulation as a computer program. It is logical because the computer is a logic machine with a logical substrate producing all the virtual simulations.      So in tomorrow's representation, when the new subsequence comes into play, whenever the question of prime or composite concerning 127 or 128 arises, the subsequence that is the virtual reality program now also runs the sub-sub- sequence that was missing in the part of the program representing times heretofore. The new stuff just adds 1 to 128 or 127, calculates whether the sum is prime or a power of 2 using the old rules, and pops out the new answer for the numbers before the addition was made.      Voila, 127 is a power of 2 and 128 is a prime number.      Heh-heh-heh!      That's all I have time for today.

2028,"Thank you for this much needed and helpful post.      @Infinite Growth:      St. Paul did not forbid all judgement. If he did, he would not have written in 1 Corinthians 5:3, ""For I, on my part, thought absent in body but present in spirit have already judged him who has so so committed this, as though I were present.""      St. Paul is referred to a man who is sleeping with his father's wife whom the Corinthians have not rebuked out of a disordered tolerance that is so well described in Feser's post above.      Some of the distinctions in the post that are also found in St. Thomas are helpful to determine in what conditions a judgement can be made without being rash. One important distinction is between an exterior act (someone's actions which we can see) and an interior act (an inward intention which only God can see). You can judge an act and recognize that it is wrong without attributing to the person malice. The person may be acting wrongly out of ignorance and this is significantly less culpable than malice. In that instance, you could approach someone calmly and explain to them why the exterior act was not moral. This would be an act of mercy that the Church calls ""Instructing the ignorant."" Again you can do this without assuming that the person is either malicious or an imbecile. In fact, to instruct someone actually presumes goodwill. It presumes that they care about the truth and that if you take the time to explain the truth, that they will be inclined to follow it.      So, we have to make distinctions about what being judged and this can help us from making assumptions about intentions which we cannot be sure of without knowing someone's character and habits. This does not prevent us from judging the exterior acts of anyone even if we don't know them. Nor does it prevent us from assessing their assertions even if we don't know them.      It is also important to highlight that we can get to know someone's character and can make judgement's on that. In this, we just have to be much more careful and, again, err on the side of charity for their good and ours. However, if someone habitually steals or commits adultery or lies, we don't have to pretend that they have a good character when it is obvious that they don't.

2262,"""one would have to show that there is something either internal to God’s nature or external to him that compels him to create. But given that the divine nature is as classical theists, on independent grounds, argue it to be (pure actuality, perfect, omnipotent, etc.) there can be no need in God for anything distinct from him, so that nothing in his nature can compel him to create. And since, the classical theist also argues (and again on independent grounds) there is nothing apart from God that God did not create, there can be nothing distinct from him that compels him to create""      I don't see how that works.      1- if it's being argued that the act is free simply because it isn't being compelled by anything external to God, nevertheless it could still be compelled by God's nature - that is, what is internal to God, not external. If this is free, it is not *libertarian* free however, and entails that creation is necessary: necessitated by God's nature;      2- if it is argued that there is nothing internal to God that could compel him, because he is pure actuality, it's not clear that the argument works. For all we know, an internal necessity need not be construed as some kind of ""lack"", in the sense that ""humans need food to survive"". God didn't need creation to not be lonely or any other nonsense. But it could be a ""need"" in the sense of a necessary manifestation of the divine nature/goodness. Just like how it's true that ""God needs to not create a world of horrendous pointless torture"" (it is necessary from his nature), it could be that God's nature compels him to create - as, for example, Leibniz believed (leibnizian optimism); the neoplatonists believed (emanation); or Pseudo-Dionysius (perhaps) believed - that it is the nature of the Good to be self-diffusive.

1001,"@ Walter Van den Acker,      ""it is possible to inevitably choose something?""      Yes Walter. In the temporal paradise nothing would end it except a voluntary exit (freely choosing to turn away from the presence of God). So an infinitude of time was available, unmarred by fear, aging, or death.      Now let us look at the simple model of human free will in time (in the temporal paradise) - an infinite sequence of unbiased bits, in which lies all possible intelligible choices encoded one way or other (you, Walter, can choose any encoding method subject to finite computation).      To be unbiased, the infinite sequence would have to contain, as a subsequence, the choice to turn away from God (exit paradise). If the infinite sequence did not contain the choice as a subsequence, the infinite sequence would not be an unbiased random sequence and it would not be simple but would be complex.      So the free choice to turn from God, given endless time, is inevitable.      ""I suppose that makes sense to someone who treats logic (and God) as contingent.""

1564,"Dear @Talmid and @Michael Copas      I don't even know how to start this without sounding strange (to say the least) but based on what I was saying in the latter post about my OCD and depression, and the friendly incentive from Michael to talk about this in some way... so I am here trying to expose the arguments that I try to make my OCD go away with this topic off buddhism.      To understand the buddhist position I make an extreme amount of effort (due to how I felt every time I came in contact with it and due to the fact that I'm just a normal guy) and based myself on some works but most specifically: Jay L. Garfield ""engaging buddhism: why it matters to philosophy"" and Mark Siderits ""how things are: an introduction to buddhist metaphysics""      Things to notice about buddhism, in general, is the thesis that they subscribe to mereological nihilism, momentariness (nothing exists more than an instant), nominalism (or conceptualism depending on the 'school'), and what they call ""anti-substancehood"".      If someone is a philosopher (a true philosopher, not a continental one) I do recommend reading the Mark Siderits one since it is a defense of buddhist metaphysics positions in all its aspects (the book cover even says that it is ''buddhist philosophy for philosophers"", so let's commit the fallacy of authority here). So a literate philosopher (not some random guy like me) could see the full picture i.e how far can the arguments go in a necessary way and if they were to be coherent at all at the end of the day. Btw, Ed, I hope that you're reading this.      So, the major differences between their position and ours are that:      1 - they collapse the distinction of act and potency (e.g for something to exist is for it to ""keep producing"" its effects in some way continuously, they use the example of a sprout saying that if the sprout is permanent and not momentary it should keep producing its effect continuously).      2 - they take universals to be ""abstract"" and ""causally ineffective"". Their idea of causality resembles a lot a proto-humean one (like its some kind of idea of the mind conjoining things together).      3 - they do not even address the Aristotelian sense of substance at all and collapse its position with bare substrata.

1093,"Dr. Feser, thank you for a solid post on suffering.      A few of the comments above have brought up the problem of ""animal pain."" While I understand the standard response to that to be something along the lines of ""necessity justified in view of the perfection of creation,"" I'm wondering if there is not a richer answer hidden in the back of our tradition. Specificly, I'm wondering about the role of angels in all this.      Think of something like Tolkien's cosmology - physical evil and disorder entered into creation when the principalities and powers of the world (The Valar and Maiar) entered into conflict with each other, one desiring to fullfill the creators plan to make a habitation for the ""children of illuvitar"" (rational life), and others, out to make a dominion for themselves. As proper ""sub-creators,"" God, in his secondary causality, had given spiritual beings the duties of care and creation in the physical world, and the flaws, imperfections, and downright violence of creation were due to the infidelity of some of the powers intrusted to their care. If we hold the standard line that fallen angels fell in the first instant of their creation, and, further, that they had been, nevertheless, been given dominion over certain parts or aspects of creation, then Johanine language about the ""lord of this world,"" and Pauline language about the ""princes of the powers of the air,"" makes a lot more sense, and can even be joined to an evolutionary cosmology.      The universe is an odd place, and the creation of the conditions for life, let alone rational life, in an odd, (physically fallen?) cosmos could be seen as the fruit of angelic conquest over malign forces. Furthermore, evolution itself might be seen as being helped along or guided by forces trying to bring about God's will in creation.      This sounds fantasic, even as I write it, but I'm wondering if anyone else has explored this train of thought.",dr feser thank solid post suffering comment brought problem animal pain understand standard response something along line necessity justified view perfection creation wondering richer answer hidden back tradition specificly wondering role angel think something like cosmology - physical evil disorder entered creation principality power world valar maiar entered conflict one desiring fullfill creator plan make habitation child illuvitar rational life others make dominion proper sub-creators god secondary causality given spiritual being duty care creation physical world flaw imperfection downright violence creation due infidelity power intrusted care hold standard line fallen angel fell first instant creation nevertheless given dominion certain part aspect creation johanine language lord world pauline language prince power air make lot sense even joined evolutionary cosmology universe odd place creation condition life let alone rational life odd physically fallen cosmos could seen fruit angelic conquest malign force furthermore evolution might seen helped along guided force trying bring creation sound fantasic even write wondering anyone else explored train thought,feser,1937,0

Just go with the slowly moving procession around the Cathedral, which ended in the very sacristy of the alleged deed. Click your stopwatch off. You can do this. Or at least you could when I did it a few years back. Tell me how it was physically possible for the Archbishop, on the first Sunday after his enthronement, to excuse himself from the parishioners at the West door, get round to the cathedral sacristy, be surprised to find two young choir boys there (one of whom, before he sadly died, denied to his mum that he was ever sexually abused by any priest) swigging altar wine, think ""Great! I'll rape these two young lads"" and do both deeds which the complainant said took a couple of minutes (!!), and cover up the fact - getting the boys (one of whom denied this ever happened, it needs to be reiterated) out of there and zipping up, as it were - before the liturgical procession arrived in the very same room.      The timing shows up the flimsiness of the accusation. We are asked to believe that with a bevy of people about to descend on the room in a time unknown to me in the moment, but possibly just seconds away, I can rape two boys (one of whom denied to his mother that he was ever sexually abused, I need to repeat this) dispatch them, zip myself up and get away with it.

Ex- priest and no fan of Pell Paul Bongiorno admitted on national radio that he lived with then Fr Pell and the serial sex offender Fr Ridsdale, but that he had no idea what this creep (but also himself abused, mind you, which shows up the perpetuating nature of this evil) was doing on a regular basis.

3734,"Tom,   Material interactions are net lossless.      When 2 blobs of putty splat their motion seems to be lost. That is a core misunderstanding of Aristotle that makes the argument from motion, the First Way, unsound.      I left it to the reader to understand the generalized sense of the word ""motion"" in this context, but I see that was not to be. More specifically, the kinetic energy of the blobs of putty is not lost, only transformed. For example, one of the simplest transformations to realize is that the kinetic energy of motion of the blobs of putty, considered as whole objects, is transformed into the kinetic energy of molecular motion, what we call heat.      The same holds true for any observable process that seems to require a continual input of energy to keep it going. What appears to be what we now know as frictional losses are not actually net losses at all. You can get a sense of this by simply rubbing your hands together, whereby the energy needed to move your hands against an apparent resistance is transformed into heat, which is the energy of molecular motion.      Aristotle had the mistaken notion that objects would slow and stop and their motion would be lost, and this leads to an argument for a first mover. While it is true that the obvious movement of an object will stop absent an external mover to keep it going, what Aristotle failed to realize is that the energy of the motion of the observed object was in fact transformed into other forms of energy in a net lossless transformation.      Because there is no net loss of material, that is matter/energy that are equivalent, there is no necessity for a first mover to sustain our world of observed motions.      ""...completely CONSISTENT with it.""   The First Way is not an argument for CONSISTENCEY, rather, the First Way is an argument for NECESSITY.      One can concoct an unbounded number of unevidenced speculations that are CONSISTENT with modern physics, no prizes for such fanciful prattle.      ""Therefore it is necessary to arrive at a first mover"" is what Aquinas claimed. That claim is unsound because the First Way employs multiple false premises as an argument for the NESESSITY of a first mover, and is logically invalid as an argument for the existence of god.

As a matter of empirical fact, we must remember things like:      1\. The Polish state never collaborated with the Nazis. Compare that with other European governments. This refusal to collaborate, and the formation of Europe's largest resistance, happened at enormous cost. This, in addition to Nazi crimes against the populace.   2\. Even the number of only those Poles recognized by Yad Vashem outstrips the combined number of people recognized from all other nations combined. Proportion and scale matter.   3\. The penalties for aiding Jews were uniquely and incomparably severe in Poland (involving the execution of the person aiding, his family, maybe neighbors, etc). And yet, point (2).   4\. Poland was home to something like 80% of world Jewry at the time of the war and the majority of the world's Jews for centuries. Any occurrence of antipathy (and don't forget Jewish bigotry, which did exist) at the time of the war was driven by economic, but also cultural, political, social, and historical factors, not racial hatred. That is, there was no impulse to exterminate any group and any crimes committed were isolated incidents of criminal opportunism taken during the chaos of wartime, not systematic programs of liquidation or some broad expression of national hatred. There were also incidents where Poles were forced under threat of death to participate in Nazi operations, incidents that some Jewish authors have grotesquely misrepresented either maliciously or through incompetence (e.g., Jan Gross).

2298,"Finally, Davies emphasizes that “to speak of God as simple is not to attribute a property to God but to deny certain things when it comes to God” (p. 179). Here, as he has in other work, Davies emphasizes the idea that the ascription of attributes to God should be understood as an exercise in _negative_ or _apophatic_ theology. The main arguments for classical theism, he points out, emphasize both that the world is contingent or conditioned in various respects, and that an ultimate explanation of the world must be _un_ conditioned and _non_ -contingent in those respects. (Though, just in case he wouldn’t himself use it, I should note that the language of “conditioned” and “unconditioned” in this context is mine, not Davies’.) In particular, God must _not_ be changeable, must _not_ have properties that are distinct from each other or from him, and so on. This is what it means to characterize him as simple. But by the same token, he must _not_ be compelled to create by anything either internal to his nature or outside of him.

Indeed, social media exchanges and political discourse sometimes seem to consist in little more than rash judgment as Aquinas characterizes it – that is, judgment about “the inward intention, or other uncertain things” about another person, which “proceeds not from benevolence but from bitterness of heart.” Opponents are routinely demonized, condemned as wicked rather than merely wrong. Their claims and arguments are not evaluated by way of a dispassionate consideration of evidence and logical strength, but dismissed _a priori_ as stemming from bad motives. Policy differences are attributed, not to sincere but mistaken opinions about what is best for the country, but to cynical political calculation.

1145,"""I think it would be closer to say that you completely misunderstand, since almost all of what you say is tangential, not contradictory, to what I said""      Well, it seemed to me that you had reduced relevant moral norms to customs and a ""framework of human practices and institutions"", and I strongly disagree with that. That human suffering is (ceteris paribus, to avoid soul-building considerations) something lamentable is a necessary truth, for example.      ""But you are evidently fatally deceived as to the meaning of that term, since you believe (apparently?!) that creatures ""come to possess"" these same eminent perfections when they are perfected""      They do not come to possess the same exact thing univocally (which in God would only be one perfection), but whatever they actuality come to possess must be pre-contained within God in at least the same degree or in a greater way. As such, every actuality in our ""moral agency"" must be present in God, and *not* in an inferior way. Every actuality, not every limitation. If God possessed our perfection of Intellect in a way that made him unable to know things, that would be absurd. It would be inferior. If God possessed our perfection of moral agency in such a way that he could not know moral truths (""rape is wrong"", ""human suffering is ceteris paribus bad and to be avoided"", etc) and could not act in accordance with moral truths or practical judgment, then it would be an inferior actuality. Which would be absurd.      So you are turning the discussion into something else - I never said anything that was incompatible with analogy, for instance; I was even quite explicit in saying that God's formal possession of our perfections (again, see Garrigou- Lagrange for example) does not deny analogy. And you are missing the point that if moral agency is a pure perfection (like wisdom is), then it is also proper to say God is a moral agent. Except if you wanna reject that God is wise, perhaps.      But if God did not know you existed or that you and I were having this conversation, this would certainly be a problem and he would not be ""God"" in the way that believers take him to be. And not in the sense that believers might have mistaken views of God (thinking he has real parts for instance, or is changing or whatever), but in a sense that would make most of them conclude that God would (absurdly) be seriously defective, and not worthy of worship at all.      It's not that hard, actually. If God is indifferent to (e.g.) a child being tortured to the point where he could simply not bother to do anything to stop or prevent it, when it is in his power to do so, then God would be seriously defective, unimpressive and unworthy of love and worship.      In which case he would not be God, as God is supposed to be.      But then God cannot be indifferent to that kind of stuff, i.e. prima facie, if God exists, he should be stopping or preventing these evils, unless he has morally sufficient reasons for not doing so (and then we're back to standard theodicy, skeptical theism, etc. Which us theists cannot avoid.)",think would closer say completely misunderstand since almost say tangential contradictory said well seemed reduced relevant moral norm custom framework human practice institution strongly disagree human suffering ceteris paribus avoid soul-building consideration something lamentable necessary truth example evidently fatally deceived meaning term since believe apparently creature come posse eminent perfection perfected come posse exact thing univocally god would one perfection whatever actuality come posse must pre-contained within god least degree greater way every actuality moral agency must present god inferior way every actuality every limitation god possessed perfection intellect way made unable know thing would absurd would inferior god possessed perfection moral agency way could know moral truth rape wrong human suffering ceteris paribus bad avoided etc could act accordance moral truth practical judgment would inferior actuality would absurd turning discussion something else - never said anything incompatible analogy instance even quite explicit saying formal possession perfection see garrigou- lagrange example deny analogy missing point moral agency pure perfection like wisdom also proper say god moral agent except wan na reject god wise perhaps god know existed conversation would certainly problem would god way believer take sense believer might mistaken view god thinking real part instance changing whatever sense would make conclude god would absurdly seriously defective worthy worship hard actually god indifferent eg child tortured point could simply bother anything stop prevent power god would seriously defective unimpressive unworthy love worship case would god god supposed god indifferent kind stuff ie prima facie god exists stopping preventing evil unless morally sufficient reason back standard theodicy skeptical theism etc u theist avoid,feser,3096,0

But I doubt that sanctifying grace makes a non-Catholic a member of the Church.      I doubt that Pope Pius XII and Msgr. Joseph Clifford Fenton tell us the difference between being a member of the Church and being in the Church as a nonmember of it.      Pius XII and Fenton say that only Catholics are members of the Church since each member of it must meet four requirements. He must wear the baptismal mark on his soul, profess Catholicism, be willing to submit to the pope and to the Church's other legitimate hierarchy, and not be under full excommunication. By those standards, a Protestant in sanctifying grace is in the Church as a nonmember of it.      But the dogma that there's salvation in only the Catholic Church is still true because people can be in the Church as nonmembers of it.      See Mystici Corporis Christi and Msgr. Joseph Clifford Fenton's book ""The Catholic Church and Salvation.""      A non-Catholic is in the Church if there's sanctifying grace in his soul. So he'll die in her if he's in that grace when he does. But his sect doesn't get him to heaven. If he reaches it, he does that despite that sect, not because of it.      That's why Blessed Pope Pius IX writes:   ""Our Predecessor, Gregory XVI, an “insanity,”2 viz., that “liberty of conscience and worship is each man’s personal right, which ought to be legally proclaimed and asserted in every rightly constituted society; and that a right resides in the citizens to an absolute liberty, which should be restrained by no authority whether ecclesiastical or civil, whereby they may be able openly and publicly to manifest and declare any of their ideas whatever, either by word of mouth, by the press, or in any other way.” But, while they rashly affirm this, they do not think and consider that they are preaching “liberty of perdition;”3 and that “if human arguments are always allowed free room for discussion, there will never be wanting men who will dare to resist truth, and to trust in the flowing speech of human wisdom; whereas we know, from the very teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ, how carefully Christian faith and wisdom should avoid this most injurious babbling.”4""      From what you're telling me, I must have misinterpreted John Paul's quotation from Redemptor Hominis. But his Assisi meetings and Vatican II's religious liberty may make some non-Catholics likely to die outside the Church.

1465,"Right: it is Good's delight to spread good, not solely when and because it is ""owed"", but even where good is not owed. Thus, God's act of creation is spreading good where no good is owed - no thing _deserves_ to be granted existence, so for every thing, its existence is a gift to it.      And just as a good person can give goods to others where they are not owed, out of kindness, generosity, or mercy: so also a person can _relieve debt_ as a kind of gift to the person who owes. To show this more easily: if John owes me $100, and Bill kindly pays John's debt to me, I am paid off, and John no longer owes me. If Bill does this as a gift, nobody is HURT and my debt is satisfied.      Similarly, if I decide to ""pay off"" John's debt to me by considering it paid, I make a gift to John like Bill does above. Gifts are not **contrary** to justice, they are BESIDE it. It's just that I am both the giver and the one whose receivable is ""paid off"" by my gift.      For moral wrongs, we cannot forgive the part of the wrong that lies in the _sin against God_ , because that is a debt owed toward God, not us. But we can forgive the part that is owed to us.      Broadly speaking, it may be either prudent or imprudent to easily forgive some debts against us: too easily forgiving money debts could cause some people to become spendthrifts and wastrels. Similarly, too readily forgiving _offenses_ against us might have a similar result. But aside from that measure of prudence, Christ tells us to be willing to forgive any and all offenses against ourselves, and indeed the examples of both Christ and the saints shows them forgiving persecutors right in the midst of those acts of persecution - where clearly no remorse exists.      Perhaps someone can clarify distinctions about granting forgiveness of the _offense_ (qua guilt) while not relieving the debt of some kind of restitution? That, it seems, is part of what Oktavian is raising.",right delight spread good solely owed even good owed thus act creation spreading good good owed - thing deserves granted existence every thing existence gift good person give good others owed kindness generosity mercy also person relieve debt kind gift person owes show easily john owes bill kindly pay debt paid john longer owes bill gift nobody hurt debt satisfied similarly decide pay debt considering paid make gift john like bill gift contrary justice beside giver one whose receivable paid gift moral wrong forgive part wrong lie sin god debt owed toward god u forgive part owed u broadly speaking may either prudent imprudent easily forgive debt u easily forgiving money debt could cause people become spendthrift wastrel similarly readily forgiving offense u might similar result aside measure prudence christ tell u willing forgive offense indeed example christ saint show forgiving persecutor right midst act persecution - clearly remorse exists perhaps someone clarify distinction granting forgiveness offense qua guilt relieving debt kind restitution seems part oktavian raising,feser,1940,0
1075,"@ Walter Van den Acker,      Original sin was the fall of creation and suffering was the consequence of this fall. We are all in this fallen creation. No one is being ""punished"", not even Adam and Eve. They just inevitably chose sin given free will and time. Human free will can also be modelled by an infinite unbiased random binary sequence so all choices exist in it somewhere (as simple a model as you are likely to find). Adam and Eve, in time, chose to leave temporal paradise and enter the fallen creation. Knowledge of good and evil meant a return to temporal paradise was gone without the intervention of God to bring them to the new creation, the eternal (outside of time) paradise with God.      This is where we are, all of us, people, babies, good people, bad people, dogs, ticks, mosquitos, and viruses. There is only one creation (simplicity again). We are all in it together. God did not cause multiple worlds for each to choose, and by the choice define right and wrong (for you are the one claiming to redefine things, not me). As a human with an infinite component to your mind, since you are free, you can always choose your own way to stay separate from God. In eternity (outside of time), when the new creation replaces this one, choosing will no longer be possible, so if you have elected to be separate from God, you will stay separate from God.      The world we live in is not so by necessity. It could have been anything (modelled by the random sequence). It could have been a world in which 1+ 1 is 3 and the rules of logic could have been anything. But the world we live in is the way it is because of love. Love, not necessity. Love is why after inevitably (given endless time) exiting temporal paradise, there is still Salvation if you freely choose it.

Suppose that Alice and Bob are not fully utilitarian, but they incorporate into their ethics (which they follow perfectly) an anti-conventionalist element (and that's also a part of their shared knowledge). Thus, they think that the fact that one has promised p is a fairly weak reason, of degree epsilon, against performing p. Then, if epsilon>0, then it seems that by their lights Alice and Bob should lift their left hands rather than their right, if they promised to lift their right, since their behavioral bias is anti-promissory, and each knows the other to have such a bias. Very well. Now take the limit as epsilon (the strength of the reason they think favors breaking promises) to zero. For every epsilon>0, they should lift their left hands rather than their right. It seems to be a reasonable continuity conclusion that for epsilon=0, they should either be neutral between lifting their left hands rather than their right or should still prefer the left, but definitely should not prefer their right.

It is the inevitable concomitant of the persecution Christians must face for preaching the Gospel and condemning the world’s wickedness. It is an inescapable punishment for sin, which we must embrace in a penitential spirit. By way of suffering we pay both our own temporal debt and that of others for whom we might offer up our suffering. By way of it we most closely unite ourselves to Christ’s Passion.

If external flourishing were aggregated summatively, then it would have been better if Russia rather than Poland produced Copernicus, because there are more Russians than Poles, and so there would have been more people with the external good of “being a citizen of a country that produced Copernicus.” But that’s a mistake: it is a good that each Pole has, but the good doesn’t multiply with the number of Poles.

2102,"Hey, Uncommon.      If you have some time, check this (https://naturalhistory.si.edu/education/teaching-resources/life- science/early-life-earth-animal-origins). Now, this is an example of what I have been trying to say.      Leaving aside the fact that the text tried to implicitly assert the plausibility of the mitochondria theory as a 'known fact' or true without arguing - when it's in fact just a theory among others. Look what they say about animals - especially multicellular ones. And besides the fact of the 'magical' conjoining of diverse cells or microorganisms inside microorganisms, they are doing exactly as I said in the example.      As I said, this sounds insane. But based on your comments and @Tom Cohoe - and some things I read of Ed's work - I think we can say something about this. First, even though this is all true and or cells and etc. we're co-opted by 'who knows why' to work together, the history is very different now than it was long ago. Our ACTUAL existence is not like it was long ago. They say in the text that the microorganisms that formed the mitochondria were separable in principle - at least they suppose it is that way. In our actual existence, we can't separate our parts and expect them to work ALONE or in the same way, as it was long ago (again, supposing that they were right) because they are organs - parts of substances - not substances in their own right.      But one of the major problems I think that all of this has (and I'm basing myself on somewhat the same analysis that Ed does when discussing atomism in his Scholastic Metaphysics book) is when it comes to the first organism because the first organism on earth necessarily had parts that work together - and work for him. So, even if they say that our unity is an accidental one (like atomists say), they can't get rid of substance (and prime matter) in the first place (like atomists).      What do you guys think?

3018,"@Tanner   Your second DBH quote is bunk. Turn to the first option he attacks, and ask what it means for a potential to be “beyond” the divine nature. I think his second prong suggests he is using “beyond” to mean “distinct from”. For, to reach his conclusion, this internal, unrealized potency must mean something that truly is part of God, thus undermining several essential attributes.   If I’m interpreting him correctly, I can’t help but wonder, what’s the problem? It shouldn’t be that God is realizing what could be called an objective potency. I see three possibilities for how that might threaten God’s claims to divinity:   1\. It undermines his aseity   2\. It threatens his immutability   3\. It does away with his simplicity   But it’s far from clear that realizing an objective potency does any of those things. There’s no reason to suppose that making a choice involves any kind of change on the choosing agent’s part, for example.   And we can already see why divine aseity goes on unscathed. An “objective potency”, as I’ve dubbed it here, takes it for granted that the possible thing doesn’t actually exist. It’s merely a possibility, for something that isn’t self-existing.

4050,"As long as I have been following the issue of papal fallibility regarding non- ex-cathedra statements, and the allied question of how to understand the obligation of ""religious submission"" to the non-infallible teachings of the magisterium, I have been hearing of that side-bar comment about the Holy Spirit protecting the pope from teaching _error which is destructive to souls._      And as long as I have heard it, I have wondered at its validity, or even its _meaning_ in the Catholic context. First of all, we ONLY talking about papal teaching on _faith and morals_ , and not on science, the weather, sports teams, and the best cologne. And once you have limited it to matters of faith and morals, **on what basis could you EVER prove a matter is NOT a matter that could, (if error were thought true) lead to destruction of souls**? The whole point of what God revealed to us through the Bible and Tradition is that _this is what we need for salvation_. God did not reveal everything, and in some parts more or less expressly said ""I'm not telling you that, you don't need to know"". But ""need to know"" includes, if anything, what we need for salvation. So, if it's something that the Church CAN testify to as being revealed through Scripture and Tradition, then (arguably), it is or may be needed for salvation, and it's covered by protection from ""error which is destructive to souls.""      I am not at all sure the qualifier does, or is even meant to, narrow the sense of papal teachings that receive protection from error to some lesser subset than ""on faith and morals"" so that popes might (in theory) err on some matter but that's OK but an error in that matter is ""not destructive of souls"".

2146,"The ""God Hypothesis"" is just another Ultimate Why question, which Paul Edwards addressed many years ago in a Intro to Phil textbook      ""Regarding our second issue, cosmic why questions, Edwards begins by considering what he calls “the theological why.” The theological answer to the theological why posits that a god answers the question of meaning. Major difficulties here include how we could say anything intelligible about such disembodied minds, as well as all of the other difficulties involved with justifying such beliefs. Edwards focuses particularly on whether the theological answer really answers the question, mentioning a number of philosophers in this regard: “Schopenhauer referred to all such attempts to reach a final resting place in the series of causes as treating the causal principle like a ‘hired cab’ which one dismisses when one has reached one’s destination. Bertrand Russell objects that such writers work with an obscure and objectionable notion of explanation: to explain something, we are not at all required to introduce a “self-sufficient” entity, whatever that may be…Nagel insists that it is perfectly legitimate to inquire into the reasons for the existence of the alleged absolute Being…”[ii] Thus, the theological answer appears to be one of convenience that does not fully answer our query; rather, it stops the inquiry by asking no more why questions.      Edwards differentiates the theological why question—are there gods and do they provide the ultimate explanation?—from what he calls the “super-ultimate why.” A person posing this latter question regards the theological answer as not going far enough because it does not answer questions such as “Why are there gods at all?” or “Why is there anything at all?” or “Why does everything that is, exist?” The theological answer simply puts an end to why questions arbitrarily; it stops short of pushing the question to its ultimate end. One might respond that it is obsessive to continually ask why questions, but most reflective persons do ask “Why does anything or everything exist?” suggesting that the question is basic to thoughtful persons. Of course, it may be that we just don’t know the answer to this ultimate mystery—all we can say is that the existence of anything is a mystery, its ultimate explanation remaining always beyond us.      According to Edwards, while some philosophers take the ultimate why question seriously many others argue that it is meaningless. The reason for this is that if a question cannot in principle be answered, as so many philosophers claim about this super ultimate why question, then that question is meaningless. Critics of this view agree that the question is radically different from all others but disagree that it is meaningless. They respond that ordinarily, questions must in principle be capable of being answered to be meaningful, but not in the case of this ultimate question. Yet if a question really cannot be answered, and if all possible answers have been ruled out a priori, is that not the very definition of a meaningless question?      Another way of arriving at the conclusion that the question “why does everything exist?” is meaningless, is to consider how when we ordinarily ask “why x?” we assume the answer is something other than x. But in the case of “why anything at all?” it is not possible to find something outside of everything to explain everything. So meaningful why questions are those which are about anything in the set of all things, but if our why question is about something other than everything, then why has lost its meaning because it is logically impossible to have an answer.""

Even platonists argue that.      Well, the christian does have the example of the saints, whose suffering and hardships make their lifes noble and interesting* not only to us but even to themselves. To a christian, suffering is supposed to be seen not as a crappy thing, but as a way of uniting with Christ and climbing the latter to being similar to Him.      Not only on they but on normal people, perhaps even on your case, you can see people who look at terrible times they had and see their better situation as enobled or even justified by the bad times. This even on totally secular contexts, not considering the beatific vision(who would turn everything acceptable to the receiver).      This actually seems probably a very alien thinking to a modern unbeliever, except that Nietzsche did get there, so read eventually the start of the City of God, the part that Dr. Feser is quoting, slowly and trying to see things like St. Augustine. Perhaps it help. Likely not, for it is quite a jump.      And remember: this is not a way to us to see this world as justified, but a way to trying to see how God could see things that way.

Human behavior is controlled, one way or another, by what we arrive at through thinking and what we think can be confused and incorrect, especially when others are trying to confuse for their own purposes. A person given a false argument that convinces him that he can drive up a ramp at a certain speed and leap his car over a big rock might try it and consequently hurt himself based on the false idea that the argument was correct, and this would be a mistake or confusion of his intellect, not of his feelings.

It was a lot hard to write all these comments - since I am struggling with myself to even conclude a thought. There were a lot more - and a lot more detailed criticism - that I want to write but I simply can't (especially a topic at 4.5 that's the most important part of all it but I don't have the necessary strength and a point that I tried to make à-la Aristotelian retortion in the sense that they must presuppose permanence and can't get rid of it in making their arguments in the same way that Alex Rosenberg can't get rid of intentionality when trying to 'naturalize intentionality').      And for those of you who think: ""why buddhism bothers you that much?"" The answer should be self-evident by now (and for reasons that make simple materialism looks like a weekend at the beach): look at the consequences of all that. There would be no persons, no things, and in some way just suffering. Life would be just horrible. There would be illusions all around us. All persons would be substances per accident - and that's just awful and I can't believe that there are people who find this idea pleasing. And the other reason is OCD. Looks like nothing that I could present by myself is ever sufficient to disprove them. Looks like my arguments are never enough - and since I'm just illiterate in philosophy there is a wall I could never cross.      Unfortunately, I came across buddhism by chance when I was fixated on the experiment of Benjamin Libet on free will (at least his sense of ""free will"") and stumbled across the work of Sam Harris arguing that since there was no free will there is the illusion of the self. Since I have OCD things don't 'go out' of my head that easily (like in the case of normal people). Since the idea per se is insane I tried to understand why people think that it's plausible in the first place. And by their paradoxical 'reductio' way of arguing and the abuse of science that they always propose (bearing in mind that I didn't know that there is such a thing as A-T Meta at the time) that stuck in my head and only got worse through the years.

All commentators agree that there are different levels of authoritativeness to different kinds of papal documents, from Apostolic Constitutions through encyclicals and such, down to other actions. And all agree that the pope can emphasize his teaching with different levels of formality and different levels of insistence.

It doesn't suffice that every being has ""some"" good, no, being ""is"" good.   Hence, there cannot be anything bad. And that's the crux of the problem and that's why the Classical Theism isn't consistent.   To say that even bad things should exist is simply logically impossible ""if"" being is good. That's a straightforward contradiction.      Sure, if an infinite multiverse exists, then somewhere, Quark the Ferengi exists. That may not be an insane idea, but it is not the standard Christian view, which is that God could have chosen not to create anything at all.   Your claim about qualitative and quantitative maximization is interesting here, because it contradicts what you claimed before, namely that ""being is intrinsically good"". if being is intrinsically good, then not being is intrinsically bad, so Quark the Ferengi not existing would be intrinsically bad.

So, as a matter of positive international law, it seems a difficult question.

(Quote)   ""The error which I am here trying to correct is one of the most sincere and respectable errors in the world; I have sympathy enough with it to feel shocked at the language I have been driven to use in stating the opposite view, which I believe to be the true one. To say that God ‘is a particular Thing’ does seem to obliterate the immeasurable difference not only between what He is and what all other things are but between the very mode of His existence and theirs. I must at once restore the balance by insisting that derivative things, from atoms to archangels, hardly attain to existence at all in comparison with their Creator. Their principle of existence is not in themselves. You can distinguish what they are from the fact that they are. The definition of them can be understood and a clear idea of them formed without even knowing whether they are. Existence is an ‘opaque’ addition to the idea of them. But with God it is not so: if we fully understood what God is we should see that there is no question whether He is. It would always have been impossible that He should not exist. He is the opaque centre of all existences, the thing that simply and entirely is, the fountain of facthood"".   (End quote)         The last quote is from Lewis's commentary on the nature psalms in the O.T.   All of the Scripture references in the beginning of the quote are from the Psalms.      (Reflections on the Psalms, Chapter 8 ""Nature"")   (Quote)   ""But of course the (Jewish) doctrine of Creation leaves Nature full of manifestations which show the presence of God, and created energies which serve Him. The light is His garment, the thing we partially see Him through (104:2), the thunder can be His voice (29:3–5). He dwells in the dark thundercloud (18:11), the eruption of a volcano comes in answer to His touch (104:32). The world is full of his emissaries and executors. He makes winds His messengers and flames His servants (104:4), rides upon cherubim (18:10), commands the army of angels.   All this is of course in one way very close to Paganism. Thor and Zeus also spoke in the thunder; Hermes or Iris was the messenger of the gods. But the difference, though subtle, is momentous, between hearing in the thunder the voice of God or the voice of a god. As we have seen, even in the creation- myths, gods have beginnings. Most of them have fathers and mothers; often we know their birthplaces. There is no question of self-existence or the timeless. Being is imposed upon them, as upon us, by preceding causes. They are, like us, creatures or products; though they are luckier than we in being stronger, more beautiful, and exempt from death. They are, like us, actors in the cosmic drama, not its authors. Plato fully understood this. His God creates the gods and preserves them from death by His own power; they have no inherent immortality. In other words, the difference between believing in God and in many gods is not one of arithmetic. As someone has said ‘gods’ is not really the plural of God; God has no plural. Thus, when you hear in the thunder the voice of a god, you are stopping short, for the voice of a god is not really a voice from beyond the world, from the uncreated. By taking the god’s voice away—or envisaging the god as an angel, a servant of that Other—you go further. The thunder becomes not less divine but more. By emptying Nature of divinity—or, let us say, of divinities—you may fill her with Deity, for she is now the bearer of messages.""

3264,"(continued from previous post)      So, in the case of Honorius, we see this distinction between formal and material heresy is not made, and the question of whether it could have been formally heretical is challenged by the fact that in his own lifetime (at least while holding the Chair), Honorius himself would have been the final court of appeal. Assuredly he would not have taken his own view to be heretical. So right there there seems to be a strong reason to declare he was at least not a FORMAL heretic. But this takes us to the question of the authority of FUTURE councils and Popes. Many questions arise.      First, it seems to me that while current popes have primacy of jurisdiction, and infallibility in ex cathedra teaching, their juridical judgments are not infallible (leaving aside the issue of the infallibility of canonizations of saints). But of course, in their time no one would have the authority to ignore or override a Pope's juridical judgment. Vatican I makes this much clear. BUT, could such a person still believe, privately or publicly, that a current pope's judgment was wrong, even while admitting that neither he (that person himself) nor anyone other than the Pope could juridically do anything about this? It seems this would be the case, though it would also be within the Pope's power to discipline such a person.      So, it does seem possible that a Pope could wrongly judge that someone was not in heresy, or that the person was heretical, but juridically that judgment would still have to be honored, since the current Pope would have the final say in such matters.

3671,"@ StardustyPsyche      In Newtonian mechanics, energy is proportional to the square of momentum. Energy is a far more complicated notion then momentum and the conservation of energy as a principle came long after Newton. It must be constantly revised to account for new findings. Leibniz understood the conservation of kinetic and potential mechanical energy but that was only the beginning and he didn't call it energy. Meanwhile, Aristotle had said the equivalent of ""Energy is a condition that describes the capacity to do work"". That's not bad for someone the Aristotle denouncers always misunderstand and denounce as an illogical step on their illogical denunciation of Aquinas.      There was no speed limit in Newtonian mechanics and Aristotle's supposed worry that a prime mover acting forever on an object could move it to a speed that in the infinite limit was infinite is in no way inconsistent with Newtonian mechanics.      If you would understand what I've tried twice already using the discovery that neutrinos have mass, you would also understand that the speed of light as an absolute speed limit is also not inconsistent with this so-called worry of Aristotle's. Perhaps it would have been simpler to point out that in Einstein's relativity, space intervals in the direction of motion grow smaller proper to the object in relative motion and become 0 in the infinite limit so that an object with 0 rest mass covers any space interval in 0 proper time, corresponding to infinite speed in spacetime events separated by finite time and space in a frame in which objects with non zero rest mass (that's you and me) are at rest. The 0 space limit that an object acted upon by the prime mover forever would measure in its tangent bundle spacetime manifold (inertial reference frame in curved spacetime) is completely consistent with Aristotle's supposed ""worry"".      I have pointed out that Aristotle did not forecast modern relativity, but that this supposed worry is completely CONSISTENT with it. This is the same as that understanding that a ball dropped from a building will fall to the ground is not the modern science of gravity but is completely CONSISTENT with it.      What happens with an individual object is not what happens with a manifold of spacetime events in Einstein's relativity. The development in time of such a manifold is not predicted by relativity because position and momentum (or time and energy) are not precisely definable at any single spacetime event, so the whole manifold of spacetime events is not predicted, uncertainty growing in the time coordinate from any defined manifold of spacetime events at a particular time (events separated by 0 interval) on that manifold.      This you do not seem to understand or want to understand.      ""Russell found that scarcely a sentence [that Aristotle and the ancient philosophers] wrote was correct.""      Ha-ha. Why if Russell said it, it has to be the truth, huh.

4219,"Vincent,      You mention souls having to be branded by their bodies - nevertheless, once the soul loses the body, it CONTINUES TO EXIST. Which would be sufficient to refute the idea that existence is the same as material exemplifications. That seems obvious to me. If you wanna say things exist because they have matter, you cannot say that a disembodied soul can exist or continue to exist; at most you can say that such a soul has existed before, but no longer exists, if it no longer has matter.   Saying angels also have prime matter is okay but that'd just be another cost for a position that seems implausible and frankly doesn't seem to accomplish much.      ""As for God, His essence and existence are commonly held to be identical, anyway.""      But God is not material. So it just seems bizarre to suggest that existence comes from prime matter.      And overall, I cannot quite make sense of what you are suggesting except if we are just calling ""Existence"" ""Matter"". In that case, the form will be the Essence and Matter will be ""Existence"" and you have only a semantic difference.      The whole point of the Essence x Existence distinction, in a nutshell, is that there is a real actuality that is the ""oomph"" of things existing. When you consider a unicorn, you can understand what it is without knowing whether it actually exists or not. This is so because its existence is not the same as its essence. Sure, the unicorn's existence qua unicorn involves material exemplification, but there might be things which exist without matter (as the examples I gave), and in any case we are just trying to maintain a principle of actuality/reality here. You seem to just be turning that principle into matter. One could make more objections from the nature of prime matter and how it can be changed etc., but it's not even clear to me what you're trying to accomplish with that, and how you would avoid the arguments for a real distinction (if you really are trying to abandon it).      ""What I insist is that God's Mind or Essence has multiple thoughts and intentions which are contingent accidents - e.g. God's concept of this universe, and His intention to make it.""      But where do these accidents come from? They could only be caused by the divine essence, but then God would just be the simple essence anyway. And it seems impossible for the accidents to come about, since they would have to actualize God somehow (in the way accidents actualize the subjects), but God as pure actuality (the simple essence as you admitted) would not be able to be actualized by accidents. To put it differently: I worry that God could only cause himself parts if he already had parts in the first place (a potential to receive the actuality of the accidents/be modified by the accidents), so it would be viciously circular.   Another worry I have is that the First Cause would already prepossess in itself the actualities of the accidents it would cause, but then, what's the point? And it would be the case of a something actualizing itself, which is impossible.      ""an agent's choice to do something must be (at least logically, even if not temporally) preceded by a plan or intention to do it. ""      If intentions do not determine the choice, then it seems you are treating intentions as if they were non-determining motives or predispositions. But then the classical theist can agree that God DOES have these intentions. I certainly believe that, at least. To me, God created this universe because he was impressed by reasons R, and his being impressed by reasons R is not a contingent fact, but a necessary one. God is impressed by R in every world.      So what's the issue? Classical theists need not deny that God has intentions to act. If you accept the fact that God can create different things in different worlds without there having to be any differences in intrinsic properties in God between these worlds as he chooses what to create (something you should accept if you accept LFW) then what is the problem?

THToD:      Like you and Alston, I am inclined to agree that ""belief"" is at best an awkward way to describe God's cognition. However, I think a major part of the reason why God doesn't fundamentally have beliefs is that there is no room for a gap in God between cognition and reality.

But it also insists that he was nevertheless able not to create this particular world, or indeed any world at all.

At the same time, more than any previous official teaching document, it makes clear that there can be cases in which non-infallible magisterial acts can be deficient, and in which a faithful theologian can, accordingly, respectfully raise criticisms. Given the ambiguities of several magisterial statements of recent years, the timing of _Donum Veritatis_ seems providential. In any event, and [as I have discussed elsewhere](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2016/12/how-pope-benedict-xvi- dealt-with.html), as head of CDF and as pope, Ratzinger was in reality the opposite of the “Panzer Cardinal” of self-serving liberal myth.

3942,"As I see it, Ovidiu is correct in saying      _Or, put differently, the essential idea here is an anthropological one: the teleology of man is to be united with God (to become god through grace)._      Yes. Theosis was not part of God's plan _as a result_ of the Fall. And therefore fc rightly observes      _It was always G-d's intention to offer theosis._      And Anonymous rightly says      _As fc stated before, the Incarnation must have been foreseen before Time,_      But it **does not follow** from this that God DECIDED upon the Incarnation _because_ he foreknew about the Fall. This makes God's action to be _**caused by**_ Adam's action, which is wrong. So, we need to be more circumspect in how we describe it:      God intended theosis in the very formation of human nature;   He knew from all eternity that Adam would Fall;   He intended from all eternity to rescue man from the Fall;   He intended from all eternity to accomplish that rescue by the Incarnation.      _In a certain sense_ God's intending the Incarnation ""hinged upon"" Adam's sin, and it is in this sense that we refer to that sin as ""O Happy Fault!"". But of course every sin (and certainly that first human sin) is wrong, and ought to be repudiated; Adam (as Tradition has it, saved in the long run) would have had to have remorse for said sin, and remorse _just is_ an internal position of repudiation of the sin in terms of its wrongness and its guiltiness. But any sinner can regret the _wrongness_ of the sin while being grateful to God for some _goodness_ which God brings out of the sin through his power.      And since God wills _primarily_ the goodness **of the ENTIRE ORDER of the created providential order rather than the goodness of any one element thereof, (in willing Creation), He wills most especially the unifying principle of goodness of that created order - which (the saints tell us) is the Incarnation, in that the Son's union of divinity with a created nature ennobles the entire created order, as well as making possible (due to sin) the theosis of the highest natural beings, which is _their_ proper end, and thus the highest good of the highest natural beings.

But it's important though that for buddhists things have no motion since motion would imply substances or something that survives. And that's where I collapse because I'm not so good in A-T meta to explain all the problems with the argument that Siderits sets out in the book. Unfortunately - but sincerely - I can only feel that something is very wrong (and I'm not proud of not pointing out what is it). But I can at least think that is by making seriously controversial claims like ""things produce their effects and them go out of existence"" that the argument supposedly has some weight. But even if that's so, it's not clear that that could not be interpreted as an ephemeral substance (the ones that Ed exemplifies when talking about when explaining prime matter in Scholastic's Meta) for example.      But one thing that puzzles me a lot about buddhism - without even mentioning their purported attempt to show that they are ""not eliminativists"" about persons, but that persons just are ""useful fictions"". Is how they square to the fact from impermanence of all phenomena with things like semantics, language, or words. After all, they wrote a book arguing that people do not exist (or exist just conventionally because nothing lasts for more than a moment) exactly in a language that exist (with modifications, of course) since the 5th century i.e English. And that's what makes me puto ('pissed') with it because the evidence against their position it seems to be everywhere but they never want to look at it. And to say that since all phenomena are impermanent, so language and semantics are just conventionally true but not ultimately true just raises the question of how it is even possible in principle for something that is impermanent and shouldn't last for more than a moment gives the impression of permanence in the first place? To put it simply how could impermanent and momentary things could even in principle brought up the illusion of permanence if they are impermanent? Because if they want to salvage their position they would necessarily argue that the idea of permanence in the conscience, memory, and objects from everyday life are just illusions.

Those who make these calumnious accusations will answer to the judge of the living and the dead whether or not they believe in the final judgement.

Instruments are important but without philosophical ideas to guide their use (such as the platonic understanding of the role of mathematics in the study of nature), those instruments (and not all of them, because other important instruments came to be as a conseguence of this process) would have no use whatsoever in the formation of different paradigms, but just pratical uses, like many exemples in history.

But what he _cannot_ reasonably do is dismiss considerations of orthodoxy and heresy _tout court_. Again, by virtue of calling himself a Christian, he is committed to staying within the bounds of the revelation, and thus avoiding heresy.

2422,"@jmchugh:      ""There is no way that you could argue that the actual existence of Satan is a positive good.""      I would argue that the existence of Satan, qua *being* is a positive good, because being is good -- this is Thomism 101. God did not create Satan as Satan; Asking why permit or allow Satan qua Satan, is asking the wrong question. Satan does not exist alone in a vacuum but as an element within the created order. The created order is good (not even Satan wants to destroy it to the point of non-existence which is what you are arguing entails, rather he wants to pervert it to his *own* perverted ends); could there be some created order that is better in some aspect or other, say, without Satan as Satan? Maybe; and? At any rate, we have no way of ascertaining such things.      ""Now, as to us mortals you set-up a false dichotomy. You suggest that either we accept the traditional notion of the fall and its consequences, or that we accept the non-existence of man.""

""But there are more options than that. For we could accept for example universal salvation, annihilationism, or reincarnation.""      These are ""options"" to what? Certainly not to the fall. There is no need of salvation if there is no fall. Both anihilationism and reincarnation have fatal philosophical and theological (speaking as a Catholic) problems. Option to hell?

3587,"Mister Geocon, the problem is that this quote (like many others) is not taken out of context. It comes from the first section of Presbyterorum Ordinis, dealing with priests as ministers of the Eucharist. The section does not mention transubstantiation or the Mass as Christ's propitiatory sacrifice. Instead, in relation to religious buildings: ""...where is worshipped the presence of the Son of God our Saviour, offered for us on the sacrificial altar for the help and consolation of the faithful"". This is where the decree provided a summary of Catholic doctrine on the Mass. Yet essential chunks are avoided. Is this just the Church playing nice guy because it felt like it for the first time in its history when central doctrines are questioned, rather than proclaiming them all the louder, or something else? It's ""something else"" of course.      Of course this is not a denial of Catholic doctrine, but the absence of clarity when clarity was urgent, and measly, world-appeasing word choices like ""presence"", rather than real presence, is grubby. In a time when the real presence and the most important meanings of the Mass are denied or marginalised, to minimise such truths is to feed the sheep to the wolves. Can you see the difference between this and Trent (13th and 22nd sessions)?

3080,"I have read Hart's ""That All Shall Be Saved"" and as far as I remember nothing in his argument required necessitarianism of any kind.      Yes, he did argue that it is IMPOSSIBLE for human beings to be damned. And yes, in a way he did argue that it was IMPOSSIBLE for God not to save all the people he had made, given God's moral perfection. But again, both of these propositions are fully compatible with God deciding to not create anything at all, or deciding to create a universe with no people. The only thing that follows from the impossibility of eternal damnation is the impossibility of eternal damnation, not that God absolutely had to create our universe and save everyone, or even had to create (and save) any people.      Whether Hart actually defends necessitarianism in other works might very well be possible. But it is completely irrelevant for universalism as well as his specific argument.      Fr. Rooney says ""If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something makes it so..."" but again, when universalists say that it is necessary that God will save everyone, they are speaking of a conditional necessity, I.e. GIVEN that God has created people, it is impossible that he would then fail to save all of them. The universalist is not saying that it is necessary for God to CREATE any world or a specific world and then save everyone; he is just saying it is impossible for God to create people and then have them be lost forever to eternal damnation or annihilation.

2709,"I don't think people most people actually understand the accusation if pantheism they're making. An identification of God with Existence or, to use more platonic language, The One (The Good), cannot in principle be a pantheistic conception, since the world is obviously a complex and changing object. Panentheism may fit better, but even here outside of emanating from a singular object, due to the absolute simplicity of the absolute, it's impossible for the world to be a part of it, it lacks the parts with which anything outside of it could ever truly be related to it. Arguably, the platonist conception of the absolute is even simpler than Aristotle's unmoved mover, for the reason that Plotinus argues against Aristotle's idea of it being Thinking thinking about thoughts. Whether it's correct or not, Plotinus argues that every kind of knowledge involves minimal composition. In that sense, the One cannot be an intellect, which doesn't mean though that it's wholly unmental.      It may be easier for me than for others here since, even though I'd call myself Christian, I have zero emotional investment in the religion and would be indifferent to dropping it, but the accusation that a lofty conception of God removes any kind of personal relation, for me, just shows that we too heavily rely on a, frankly, infantile conception of the supreme being, instead of following the intellectual route of letting ourselves be led into complete apophaticism, in the footsteps of Plotinus and Pseudo-Dionysius. What would knowledge be if it doesn't change? Well, not the knowledge of truths we know it, but acts that *produce* these truths. The convergence with existence and the ultimate dependency of everything on it entails that at the grass roots of knowledge, power or morality, these concepts are entailed by existence/goodness. This is just the logical consequence, something O'Conner hinted at in his book on the contingency argument. Furthermore in regards to knowledge I'd once again reference Barry Miller who quotes Patrick Grim, the idea of omniscience as propositional knowledge (P is true, God knows that P), is not a conception that can be applied to God, this just leads to contradictions. But it also means that his mode of knowledge would be as much comparable to ours as Aquinas' pure esse would be to Frege's existential quantifier",think people people actually understand accusation pantheism making identification god existence use platonic language one good principle pantheistic conception since world obviously complex changing object panentheism may fit better even outside emanating singular object due absolute simplicity absolute impossible world part lack part anything outside could ever truly related arguably platonist conception absolute even simpler unmoved mover reason plotinus argues idea thinking thinking thought whether correct plotinus argues every kind knowledge involves minimal composition sense one intellect mean though wholly unmental may easier others since even though call christian zero emotional investment religion would indifferent dropping accusation lofty conception god remove kind personal relation show heavily rely frankly infantile conception supreme instead following intellectual route letting led complete apophaticism footstep plotinus pseudo-dionysius would knowledge change well knowledge truth know act produce truth convergence existence ultimate dependency everything entail grass root knowledge power morality concept entailed existencegoodness logical consequence something conner hinted book contingency argument furthermore regard knowledge reference barry miller quote patrick grim idea omniscience propositional knowledge p true god know p conception applied god lead contradiction also mean mode knowledge would much comparable pure esse would existential quantifier,feser,2354,0

The idea is, first, that a hypothesis is a tentative explanation of some empirical event that will occur _under certain conditions_. Hence, suppose some effect _E_ occurs under certain conditions of type _T_. We might hypothesize that a cause of type _C_ is responsible, and then go on to test this by bringing about an instance of _C_ under conditions of type _T_ and seeing whether an instance of _E_ follows. If it does not, we might form some new hypothesis, to the effect that it is another sort of cause (of type _D_ , say) that is responsible. But even if our prediction is confirmed, it is possible in principle that it is nevertheless not really _C_ that is producing _E_ , but some other causal factor that is merely correlated with _C_. So we’d need to do further testing to rule that possibility out.

2840,"(Continuation)      So not just it's unfair and wrong to say that ""this usage is common to Aristotle"" but one thing that I noticed in the book of both authors is the somewhat intentional sidestep or ""shell game"" of problems - like they were trying intentionally guide the book in a way to evade potential questions to their points. To be fair, Siderits tried to address some points of that (I do recommend the reading of the Chapter 4 since the most relevant discussion of points that could be related to our philosophy concentrates there). But his position simply gives me the impression that he tries to misplace the substance into its parts (like a shell game) and then comes to the conclusion that the substance could not exist. In responding to how accidents are always found in the substances (he does not use the term accidents, I'm using it to simplify) if they do not exist, he says:      ""Consider the water atom as an allegedly indivisible substance in which inhere the qualities of color, shape, wetness and mass. Resistance to the notion that these qualities may be thought of as its parts comes from the intuition that qualities do not simply float freely in the air, that they must be tethered to something that then explains their occurrence together with other qualities. Bundle theorists are typically asked to provide the principle of qualitative unity that would explain the co- occurrence of many qualities in the absence of a substance in which they inhere. The Buddhist bundle theorist says this is the wrong question to be asking. Instead we should ask why, in the absence of empirical evidence for the existence of substances as distinct from their properties, we nonetheless have the intuition that substances are required to explain qualitative unity."" (pp. 59)      To say that ""in the absence of empirical evidence"" is just to beg the question. but he goes on to say:      ""By hypothesis, color, shape, wetness, and mass tropes are compresent at a certain spatio- temporal location. This much both sides can agree on. Here is a possible explanation of the fact that we commonly take these to all be properties of a single thing, the water atom. When we wish to specify the location of this mass trope, it is easier to indicate it by using the term “water atom” than by indicating each of the three other tropes present at that location. This makes the communication process more efficient. It also relieves us of the burden of ascertaining just which other tropes are present at that location, given that we know from past experience that mass tropes are generally accompanied by other tropes in a certain range. “Water atom” functions as a convenient designator for a certain bundle of tropes (TS 832– 34; TSP ad TS 581– 83). That they make up a bundle has as much to do with us and our interests and cognitive limitations as it does with how things are in the   world. The world as it is anyway contributes the fact of their compresence. The rest— their being unified by their joint inherence in a substance— is our doing. The Buddhist doctrine of the two truths is their answer to the bundle theorist’s problem of unification.""      Basically, he uses their conventionalist position to ""explain"" how we construe substances from things that are nothing but tropes.

If you will vanilla ice (for whatever reason), then, unless something happens to prevent this choice you have vanilla ice and not chocolate ice.""      How on earth can I choose what to eat, then? The picture you described is literally my will - completely outside of my control - determining my choice to either get vanilla or chocolate depending on some property arising in it - and you suggest that the causal origin of that property is irrelevant for whether we are libertarian free or not! That it doesn't matter where it came from. So in your model I can - with no control over it, no choice over it - just get a ""will"" to have vanilla ice and this will make me get vanilla ice instead of chocolate (unless something happens to prevent it, again something over which I presumably have no control over since all my actions would just follow upon another will arising, and it wouldn't matter where that will came from, according to you).   In what world is that libertarian freedom? That is just people being determined by a will over which they have no control. I don't think any LFW proponent would agree with that model; certainly I think most LFW theorists would agree with me. And then you just refuse to elaborate on the potential regress of the origins of the ""will"" and how, in your model, it cannot arise by the choice of the agent (since you must refuse that A at t in S can cause either X or ~X).   I am surprised that you think this would count as LFW.      I take it as essential that in LFW *we* are the ones making our choices, in an indeterministic but non-stochastic way; that we cause our actions and do so in such a way that, when we're deliberating, we can really cause one or the other at that moment, and thus under the same set of intrinsic properties.      I say we can reach an agreement and a common conclusion here: you and I have radically different ideas of LFW. So if someone accepts your model, then indeed they will have a problem with God's choice in DS. If someone subscribes to your model of LFW, then that objection to DS is a serious one, and perhaps there is no way around it.      But if someone accepts my model of LFW (or, even more modestly, accepts my model as metaphysically possible) instead, then the problem disappears. Because in my model, the agent can cause either X or ~X without requiring a difference in intrinsic properties for choosing one or the other. It's not unique to God, it's the same for humans, too.      So if someone accepts your model of libertarian freedom (call it LFW1) then the objection is very much alive. Well done. But if someone prefers my model (call it LFW2) instead, the objection isn't really impressive.

The content of concepts is given instead by the axioms of the theory in which they are embedded.

Consider, again, the equation _F_ = _ma_. Considered just by itself, it tells us nothing more than that one quantity is equal to the product of two others. And as Cartwright observes, this is true not only of the force, mass, and acceleration of a material object, but also of the area of a rectangle with respect to the length of its sides. There is nothing in the equation _itself_ that tells us which of these is its subject matter.

Therefore some intelligent being exists by whom all natural things are directed to their end; and this being we call God.""      There is nothing in modern physics that references a divine being to infuse purposeless fundamental material with purpose at some intermediate level, hence, modern physics does not align with Aristotelian physics in this regard.

So thank you, thank you so much!      @Michael, I saw the post that Ed made with an open thread and I will participate! Today was the first day in weeks that I felt a little bit better. I will try somehow engage in the arguments there, because like I said, I'm not worried about materialism per se (even though the existence of atoms and etc. sometimes puzzle me as to why God makes the world that way, you know? Why the micro exists in a way that it 'seems' that things could be ""reduced"" to them) because of the arguments Ed presented in the prolegomenon of the Scholastics Meta (I only believed materialism in this XXI century sense because I was a foolish boy born in a country that philosophy that is seriously engaging in these points marginally exists - yeah continental philosophy sucks).      My problem is the worse version of 'materialism' that is the buddhist (because in practice, doesn't matter how they argue, the consequences are basically the same but, surprisingly, worse). In these very difficult (to say the least) 3 years of my life. What really broke me from the inside (based on what I was talking about Libet) is the fact that I (and the person that I love with my life in this world, my mom, who's in fact the only family that I have in practice) could indeed be a substance per accidens (to use the best terminology) - because ALL of these ideologies like reductionism, materialism, and especially buddhism will lead to that no matter how they try to persuade or say otherwise. They will inevitably treat human beings as unreal and aggregates or 'useful fictions' (sometimes I think that it was the devil himself who plunges these ideologies into our mentality).      If there is one thing in all these 3 years that I do not forget was the pain (the mental pain and depression) that I felt and still feel. In my 24 years of life, nothing EVER hit me like that. And I don't know how people simply swallow materialism or even worse buddhism of these sorts - if they do really love their own kind ones or have any moral principles about persons at all - they should be rejecting it immediately. Because as I said what caused me all that trauma that still scares me today is the possibility of those things (i.e the fact that we are just an aggregate or unreal and live just to suffer).

By ""imaginable"" I mean strictly what is limited to normal human imagination, not the ""imagination"" of God, angels, people experiencing the beatific vision, etc. Just people like you and me. It greatly simplifies discussion and simplicity is what we are looking for.      I make a further simplification by saying that our ideas about all imaginable worlds must be communicable to other ordinary people. If it can't be communicated there is not much use in having the idea. It won't get anywhere.      This entails a further restriction, and that is that the communication must be verbal - in words that other people can understand. This could be widened somewhat. For example, ideas could be communicated by images, non verbal sounds, moving imagery, with or without sound, etc. But I hope you do not object to my just restricting it to words alone, again for simplicity. I believe that whatever can be said about communication by words alone can be extended to these other forms of communication.

890,"@ Walter Van den Acker,      An intelligible verbal communication can exist on a computer as a sequence of 1's and 0's that is made intelligible through an operational protocol that casts it to the monitor as readable words. No computer can print an infinite sequence to the screen, but a finite subsequence can be read through a computer this way. There is an absolute difference between an infinite sequence and a finite sequence here. Now no matter what the intelligible communication, it must exist throughout the infinite bitwise random sequence as a subsequence, normally distributed (from Wikipedia ""Normal Number"" on an infinite sequence of ""coin tosses"" : ""If a number is normal, no finite combination of digits of a given length occurs more frequently than any other combination of the same length"").      Yet in searching for the specific intelligible verbal subsequence described earlier it is impossible to know, if it is not found, that the infinite sequence is biased - is not normal, for the search could encompass a length of the infinite sequence that just does not contain the verbal subsequence. For example the sequence 01 should appear in 25% of the 2 bit subsequences, but if the sequence consisting of a million 1's in a row is where you happen to look for 01, you will not find 01 normally distributed in the million 1's. Such lengths missing the verbal subsequence must also appear in the infinite sequence, and they must also be normally distributed if the infinite sequence is normal, which it must be if it is bitwise 50/50 random.      This model of simplicity contains all human imaginable worlds that can be verbally communicated and yet no matter how much of it is human examined (i.e., the examination must be finite), a verbally communicable description of the finite world might never be found. You might just always be looking in the wrong place.      This is similarly true of human verbal speech about anything.      God knows this idea. It is a Divine Idea.

If these arguments come before Book X, i dont remember, them the Good Workman Argument does sound reasonable to one who accept these premises. Like Kant moral argument, hard to dismiss if you agree with the initial premises, it is just that atheists do not.      About the problem of evil, i dont remember Plato adressing it at all*, but he believed that:      \- the soul is living in a innatural condition when stuck in the body      \- that the soul is only happy when it goes to the intellectual goods, which every soul has the potential to do.      \- that after death the soul just goes eventually to another body      It seems that these premises do help developing a response to the problem of evil. Proclus,probably the best neoplatonist, did make a interesting little book on it, worth a reading.      *makes sense that the hebrews would know it(see the Torah and Job) before him, the gods that the atheists/agnostics of his time were discussing were the greek ones, so it would not come from they, and Plato was not only a elitist but also probably a ascetic, hardly the guy to care about lower people not having material goods",wcb since read law plato argues - existence god cosmological argument lead existence soul - self mover - started movement - god care u pointing better caretaker care detail work god care everything argument come book x dont remember good workman argument sound reasonable one accept premise like kant moral argument hard dismiss agree initial premise atheist problem evil dont remember plato adressing believed - soul living innatural condition stuck body - soul happy go intellectual good every soul potential - death soul go eventually another body seems premise help developing response problem evil proclusprobably best neoplatonist make interesting little book worth reading make sense hebrew would know itsee torah job god atheistsagnostics time discussing greek one would come plato elitist also probably ascetic hardly guy care lower people material good,feser,1528,0

If you have been given a gift more than another person, do not cast off the other as unworthy: it was a GIFT to you, not your own merit that brought it. Why, therefore, would you despise the person who has not received the gift, in which state _you would still be if you had not been granted the gift?_      And further: by patiently asking God that He also shower your spouse with comparable gifts of growth, mayhap you will merit God granting such growth. So: your observing a lack in your spouse is _reason to do something to help your spouse (by prayer and sacrifice),_ not reason to leave.      And further: do not let pride deceive you: if you see that you have grown in _one_ way (where your spouse has not), never forget that perhaps your spouse has grown in 3 or 4 ways less visible, where you have not. There are a thousand different avenues of growth, not one or two. God works at a different pace in each area, for each person. And not all growth is manifest to either the person growing or to those around.      Never imagine that ""incompatibility"" due to one person growing and the other not constitutes a basis for believing the marriage is ""void"". God's will for marriage is that it persist through life, even in difficult times, even in the difficulties of difficult personality clashes. Growth, alone, is not incompatibility, and even if there were some incompatibility - even if (in spite of charitable efforts) one spouse becomes _impossible_ to live with, (say, you became a Catholic and your spouse simply could not stand that) and a legal separation is necessary, that **does not void or break** the marriage, it merely means that you should live apart from your spouse for some time.

Additionally, I disagree that it is not healthy to desire other's punishment. Obviously, bloodthirstiness (of a physical or spiritual nature) is incorrect, the desire to have punishment where perhaps a lighter sentence would do, but that is merely one end of the bookends of virtue. Justice may require such harsh punishments, but it may not necessarily. C.S. Lewis wrote on this in his book ""Mere Christianity,"" with the example of a man who cheats and lies his way through life without any consideration for others' welfare, and he challenges the reader not to have a desire that the flag should be planted in that rebellious soul, which is just a healthy manifestation of justice.

Or,      (2) When unlawful demands are made upon them, the people ignore those demands to remain attached to the mass as it was before violence was done to its form; the people ignore the cadging, name-calling, and vilifying of bishops (and popes) who call them ""rigid"" neo-Pelagians by continuing to pray for those bishops and popes while refusing to submit to said unlawful persecution by refusing to give up the old mass and the immemorial teachings of the Church.      In regards to my use of the term ""unlawful"" above, I make 2 points: First, after 40 years of people at the Vatican and below insisting (without evidence) that Paul VI had abrogated the right to say the old mass, Benedict said it wasn't so. Second, while in Traditiones Custodis the pope **could have demanded** that priests request of their bishop the right to continue to say the old mass, instead the actual language is that the priest ""should"" request it of their bishops - language which is advisory rather than imperative.

2638,"Hi Ed,      In your interview, you state:      ""You’ll also find – and this is something that I discuss in my book – that the Catholic Church and the popes have officially taught for five centuries now that the kind of slavery that was practiced in the New World and the kind of slavery represented by the African slave trade was intrinsically evil. The popes condemned this consistently from the beginning. Now, it’s true that there were a lot of people who simply ignored the teaching but that was indeed the teaching. People often have this false impression…that somehow the Church is a late comer to this. Well, no. In fact, the Church has been consistently condemning what’s called chattel slavery – or the treatment of other human beings as if they were mere pieces of property or as if they were animals or something – for centuries even if the teaching was, again, often ignored.""      I have to say that this is simply incorrect. I refer you to Pius Onyemechi Adiele's work, ""The Popes, the Catholic Church and the Transatlantic   Enslavement of Black Africans 1418-1839"" (Georg Olms Verlag AG, Hildesheim 2017), which was accepted as a Doctoral Dissertation in 2014 by the Faculty of Catholic Theology of the University of Tübingen.

He writes: ""Even in the face of numerous protests made by some anti-slavery proponents in both Europe and America against the continued unjust enslavement of Black Africans, none of the popes of the Church beginning from the renaissance papacy in the fifteenth century, throughout the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries and up to the first three decades of the nineteenth century ever remembered to hearken to those voices of protests so as to extend their fatherly concern towards Black Africans laboring under the chains of Transatlantic slavery... Even in the sixteenth century precisely in 1537 during the papacy of pope Paul III, when the papacy at last began to show interest in the sufferings of peoples held under the bondage of slavery by condemning the enslavement of the Indians of the West Indies, the Black Africans were left out and ignored in this papal interest in protecting those under enslavement... The papacy showed her concern for Black Africans in 1814 and 1823 respectively only at the motivation of the British government and only on the condition that the British government will help the Church to recover her lost Papal States which were taken away from her by the Napoleonic invasion and occupation of the Papal States in 1808.""

3983,"Getting back to the comment actually made:      _For all that, it is still the Roman rite._      I may have to nitty-nit pick here: the antecedent of ""it"" is the Novus Ordo mass.      _Obviously the Novus Ordo is a departure... It was resisted, with good reason,..._      In the sense of your most recent comment: no, the Novus Ordo mass is not the Roman Rite, it is **one of the masses OF the Roman Rite.** It does not encompass and set forth the whole of and every particle of ""the Roman Rite"".      Speaking more generally: there is, so far as I have found in a reasonable amount of digging, no extant set of definitions that distinguish what, precisely, constitutes the _specific difference_ of a ""Rite"" versus other classes of liturgical distinction, such as various ""uses"" of masses. From my lack of locating any such definitions, or even anything that _purports_ to set forth the specific difference that sets the notion of ""Rites"" apart, I tentatively conclude that the historical practices that eventually came to represent the various ""Rites"" can only be distinguished as more or less _ad hoc_ collections of customs and practices, i.e. distinct by reason of historical accident rather than by reason of principled, per se differences. If so, there is nothing that necessarily prevents a _future_ practice in which the mass of the 1969 Roman Missal from being called a different ""Rite"" from the mass of the 1962 Roman Missal. If some future pope or council decided to distinguish them so, then they _would be_ distinct Rites for practical purposes, and that's (apparently) all that separates the other Rites in terms of being named so - practical purposes. The fact that Pope Benedict invented one naming option, calling one the ""ordinary form"" and the other the ""extraordinary form"" doesn't set the matter in stone, and (given that this attempt cannot be generalized to deal with, say, the Dominican mass) it may well prove unstable and short-lived.",getting back comment actually made still roman rite may nitty-nit pick antecedent novus ordo mass obviously novus ordo departure resisted good reason sense recent comment novus ordo mass roman rite one mass roman rite encompass set forth whole every particle roman rite speaking generally far found reasonable amount digging extant set definition distinguish precisely constitutes specific difference rite versus class liturgical distinction various us mass lack locating definition even anything purport set forth specific difference set notion rite apart tentatively conclude historical practice eventually came represent various rite distinguished le ad hoc collection custom practice ie distinct reason historical accident rather reason principled per se difference nothing necessarily prevents future practice mass roman missal called different rite mass roman missal future pope council decided distinguish would distinct rite practical purpose apparently separate rite term named - practical purpose fact pope benedict invented one naming option calling one ordinary form extraordinary form set matter stone given attempt generalized deal say dominican mass may well prove unstable short-lived,feser,1960,0

3885,"For another thing, the Incarnation positively aids us in pursuing what is good, in several ways. By speaking to us directly, as a human being himself, God makes the truths of revelation better known to us, thereby fostering the theological virtue of faith. By taking on our nature he also shows the depth of his love for us, thereby fostering the virtue of hope. Insofar as this prompts us to love God in return, it also fosters in us the virtue of charity. By living a perfect life, Christ sets an example of how we ought to live. By uniting divinity and humanity in himself, he reveals something of the supernatural end of the beatific vision, which also involves such a union (albeit not in exactly the same way).",another thing incarnation positively aid u pursuing good several way speaking u directly human god make truth revelation better known u thereby fostering theological virtue faith taking nature also show depth love u thereby fostering virtue hope insofar prompt u love god return also foster u virtue charity living perfect life christ set example ought live uniting divinity humanity reveals something supernatural end beatific vision also involves union albeit exactly way,feser,716,0

Difficuly one is if there is no real past, there can be no before, now, afterwards.""      The first sentence is not how a classical Theist would make the sort of assertion you are trying to make. If you are going to engage in dialogue where anyone at all takes you seriously, you are going to have to make more effort understanding the positions you appear hell bent on rejecting. Perhaps if you at least understand them correctly, that spark within you that cares about understanding rather than pretending might be fanned into a flame.      To say is correctly, you would say that God is not bound by time. That is a correct way to state the initial premise in an argument that you are set on criticizing. Now this requires an understanding of time and time's relation to matter, if you are going to actually understand a classical theist on this point.      In your third sentence quoted above you move from talking about God being outside time to simply making the assertion that this entails that there is not past, present, or future. Here you move from the assertion that since God is outside time, everyone and everything must be outside time. Well once it is framed that way (and this is an accurate way to frame the issue based on St. Augustine and St. Thomas' understanding of the relationship between time and matter--again more below--and God's relationship to time and matter), it becomes clear that what you are saying is sheer nonsense. So if you are going to frame a critique of classical theism, you are going to have to offer something beyond a sophmoric and blundering misinterpretation and misrepresentation of the premises of the classical theists argument.      Regarding the relationship between time and matter, Philo and St. Augustine held that these are interdependent and this is confirmed by modern physics (See Barr's Modern Physics and Ancient Faith). We are subject to the limits associated with time because we are corporeal beings and there is interrelationship between time and matter. After all, we measure time with respect to the movement of matter (e.g. the rotation of the earth around the sun). So the argument requires a deeper understanding and exposition of their understanding of time in order to get their argument right in the first place.      You have not taken the time to understand all of this which is why there is no one here that is impressed with what you have to say on this matter. If you wish to have your arguments taken seriously, why don't you first make a serious effort to consider the arguments of figures like St. Augustine and St. Thomas? This of course requires that you actually make a good faith effort to understand them on their terms. Now this would also require a smidge of humility in recognizing that they have something to teach you and that it is, to put it gently, relatively unlikely that you have created a fool proof argument against God's existence that no one else has ever considered. Humility and a firm grasp on reality always walk together hand in hand.",god real past present future god god directly experience every part big difficuly one real past afterwards first sentence classical theist would make sort assertion trying make going engage dialogue anyone take seriously going make effort understanding position appear hell bent rejecting perhaps least understand correctly spark within care understanding rather pretending might fanned flame say correctly would say god bound time correct way state initial premise argument set criticizing requires understanding time relation matter going actually understand classical theist point third sentence quoted move talking god outside time simply making assertion entail past present future move assertion since god outside time everyone everything must outside time well framed way accurate way frame issue based st augustine st understanding relationship time matter -- -- relationship time matter becomes clear saying sheer nonsense going frame critique classical theism going offer something beyond sophmoric blundering misinterpretation misrepresentation premise classical theist argument regarding relationship time matter philo st augustine held interdependent confirmed modern physic see modern physic ancient faith subject limit associated time corporeal being interrelationship time matter measure time respect movement matter eg rotation earth around sun argument requires deeper understanding exposition understanding time order get argument right first place taken time understand one impressed say matter wish argument taken seriously first make serious effort consider argument figure like st augustine st thomas course requires actually make good faith effort understand term would also require smidge humility recognizing something teach put gently relatively unlikely created fool proof argument existence one else ever considered humility firm grasp reality always walk together hand hand,feser,3169,0

This made me think of this:      Suppose that one believes in a First Cause that has something like a intellect and a will, even being omniscient, but who also is a moral nihilist, so this Cause is not considered divine.      To this view to work, the Cause would need to choose to create this world, of course, but how would this happens? To make a choice, one needs to intend something, but if there are in reality no good or bad things them why would the First Cause intend anything?      It can't be because the Cause make the mistake of thinking that somethings are good, for we are dealing with a omnipotent being.      It can't be because the Cause has a tendency to choose this or that, for our own tendencies are caused by our bodily constitution and by our intellect limitations, both things the First Cause is free from.

1534,"An essential part of the interpretative context is surely Pope Francis' Apostolic Exhortation 'Evangelii Gaudium': 'On the Proclamation of the Gospel in Today's World' - considered a keynote document of his pontificate, and running to 288 numbered paragraphs. Less authoritative and isolated statements should be interpreted in the light of more authoritative and extended statements such as this.      A few quotes:      ‘Throughout the world, let us be “permanently in a state of mission”.’ (25; cf. passim)      ‘All the baptized, whatever their position in the Church or their level of instruction in the faith, are agents of evangelization.’ (120)      ‘All revealed truths derive from the same divine source and are to be believed with the same faith…’ (36)      ‘Of course, we will never be able to make the Church’s teachings easily understood or readily appreciated by everyone. Faith always remains something of a cross; it retains a certain obscurity which does not detract from the firmness of its assent.’ (42)      ‘Proclaiming the Gospel message to different cultures also involves proclaiming it to professional, scientific and academic circles. This means an encounter between faith, reason and the sciences with a view to developing new approaches and arguments on the issue of credibility, a creative apologetics which would encourage greater openness to the Gospel on the part of all. When certain categories of reason and the sciences are taken up into the proclamation of the message, these categories then become tools of evangelization; water is changed into wine.’ (132)      ‘Evangelization with joy becomes beauty in the liturgy, as part of our daily concern to spread goodness. The Church evangelizes and is herself evangelized through the beauty of the liturgy, which is both a celebration of the task of evangelization and the source of her renewed self-giving.’ (24)      ‘As the bishops of the United States of America have rightly pointed out, while the Church insists on the existence of objective moral norms which are valid for everyone, there are those in our culture who portray this teaching as unjust, that is, as opposed to basic human rights. Such claims usually follow from a form of moral relativism that is joined, not without inconsistency, to a belief in the absolute rights of individuals.’ (64)      ‘Among the vulnerable for whom the Church wishes to care with particular love and concern are unborn children, the most defenceless and innocent among us. Nowadays efforts are made to deny them their human dignity and to do with them whatever one pleases, taking their lives and passing laws preventing anyone from standing in the way of this. Frequently, as a way of ridiculing the Church’s effort to defend their lives, attempts are made to present her position as ideological, obscurantist and conservative. Yet this defence of unborn life is closely linked to the defence of each and every other human right… This is not something subject to alleged reforms or “modernizations”. It is not “progressive” to try to resolve problems by eliminating a human life.’ (213)      ‘A facile syncretism would ultimately be a totalitarian gesture on the part of those who would ignore greater values of which they are not the masters. True openness involves remaining steadfast in one’s deepest convictions, clear and joyful in one’s own identity, while at the same time being “open to understanding those of the other party” and “knowing that dialogue can enrich each side” (John Paul II). What is not helpful is a diplomatic openness which says “yes” to everything in order to avoid problems, for this would be a way of deceiving others and denying them the good which we have been given to share generously with others. Evangelization and interreligious dialogue, far from being opposed, mutually support and nourish one another.’ (251)      All this may not resolve all the issues with things Francis has said and done, but it needs to be taken into account.

782,"Kant was one of the world's greatest thinkers. He phillosophy foresaw quantum mechanics.      Kant did not view things-in-themselves as containing the sum of all possibilities, and phenomena all actualities; but this duality is conformable to Kant's metaphysics as to none other. As a contribution to the metaphysics of possibility, the quantum mechanical wave function can easily be seen as complementary to Kant's idea of things-in-themselves, where various kinds of things can happen (like free will) that are not comprehensible in terms of phenomenal reality. Kant would just have to allow that characteristics of physical reality can intrude some depth into things-in-themselves, which he would not have considered -- though we can also handle this by positing an intermediate level of reality, between true unconditioned things-in-themselves and true discrete phenomenal objects -- as Kant otherwise actually does himself for space and time as ""pure intuitions."" The wave function straddles the classic Kantian boundary, sharing some properties with phenomena, others, as underlying phenomena, with things-in-themselves.      Thus, where Kant would have considered all of phenomena governed by determinism, we now see the wave function as deterministic, while the collapse of waves into particles is random. Although chance in quantum mechanics has often been argued as allowing for free will, a free cause is still a very different thing from a random cause, which doesn't need mind or self or intention. Moral freedom is thus still left among things-in-themselves. Kant himself would have had difficulty placing randomness in his ontology, if he, like Hume, believed that chance violates determinism. Since chance is now part of the physics, it cannot be denied; but it also still remains a different matter from purposive freedom.      Kant's idea that space and time do not exist among things-in-themselves has been curiously affirmed by Relativity and quantum mechanics. In Relativity, time simply ceases to pass at the velocity of light: for photons that have travelled to us as part of the Cosmic Background Radiation, time has stood still for most of the history of the universe. On the other hand, quantum mechanics now posits ""non-locality,"" i.e. physical distances, and so the limitation of the velocity of light in Relativity, don't seem to exist. This means that although time may apply to the wave function, space may not. The full empirical reality of space is only found among discrete particles and objects.      This curious result is the consequence of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Paradox, which was intended by Einstein as a reductio ad absurdum of quantum mechanics. If, for instance, a positron and an election are both created from an energetic photon, the conservation of angular momentum requires that one be spinning one way, and the other the other. But the complementary spins are equally probable for each particle. Thus, in quantum mechanical terms, the wave functions of each particle divide without a discrete state being determined. The particles might then separate to even cosmological distances, but as soon as the spin of one particle is observed, the other particle must have the opposite spin, which means that the wave function has collapsed across those cosmological distances and caused the other particle to assume a predictable spin. If this occurs instantaneously, it would violate the limitation of the velocity of light in Special Relativity.      This has now been shown to actually occur on the basis of Bell's Theorem (from John Bell, 1928-1990), meaning that Quantum Mechanics does violate Special Relativity by allowing instantaneous interactions across even cosmological distances. However, once observed, processes must still obey Special Relativity and the limitations of spatial distance, creating the kind of duality described by Kant.

AnonymousJanuary 2, 2023 at 7:54 PM, I appreciate the long and thoughtful reply.      ""the point Feser is making is that, unsurprisingly, the Aristotelian view of matter seems to fit what we observe in the quantum realm.""   Indeed, that is a core error of Dr. Feser.      Aristotle made a fundamental mistake in his view that all sublunary motion is in an impeding medium such that a moving object, absent a mover for it, will slow and stop, and it's motion will be lost.      That notion, that fundamental Aristotelian error, is nowhere supported in modern physics.      That core error of Aristotle led to the already scientifically falsified First Way by Aquinas. If that incorrect notion of Aristotle were correct then the First Way would actually be a very good argument for an unmoved mover. (here is one good source if you are interested in the 5 Ways, iteadthomam.blogspot.com/2011/01/first-way-in-syllogistic-form)      Aristotle actually had the concept of Newtonian perpetual motion in his grasp, in Aristotle's book 4 of his physics, where Aristotle describes motion as continuing ad infinitum in the void.      Bertrand Russel wrote some 100 years ago describing at length the errors of Aristotle, and described how tedious it was to read the ancient Aristotelian philosophers because nearly everything they said about physics was wrong.      ""I don’t think it’s a good counter argument to merely say, you just haven’t reduced far enough""   Ok, you can think that, fine, but actually, yes, it is the case that in the example of hydrogen, oxygen, and water Feser projects notions that seem somehow vaguely reasonable but quickly break down when one considers further reductionist models. Hydrogen, oxygen, and water are all large scale structures relative to the underlying reality, which is just much smaller scale material whizzing about interreacting as they do with whatever happens to be in the vicinity, utterly oblivious to any larger scale structures and devoid of purpose or any potential to be a building block of purpose.      Modern physics is devoid of purpose at any scale, so the assertion that modern physics in any way vindicates Aristotelian notions of purpose, or motion, or change...well, such assertions are just plain wrong.",oh ooops posted anonymous well thanks folk welcomed back posting interface changed slightly default anonymous neglected change anonymousjanuary pm appreciate long thoughtful reply point feser making unsurprisingly aristotelian view matter seems fit observe quantum realm indeed core error dr feser aristotle made fundamental mistake view sublunary motion impeding medium moving object absent mover slow stop motion lost notion fundamental aristotelian error nowhere supported modern physic core error aristotle led already scientifically falsified first way aquinas incorrect notion aristotle correct first way would actually good argument unmoved mover one good source interested way iteadthomamblogspotcomfirst-way-in-syllogistic-form aristotle actually concept newtonian perpetual motion grasp book physic aristotle describes motion continuing ad infinitum void bertrand russel wrote year ago describing length error aristotle described tedious read ancient aristotelian philosopher nearly everything said physic wrong think good counter argument merely say reduced far enough ok think fine actually yes case example hydrogen oxygen water feser project notion seem somehow vaguely reasonable quickly break one considers reductionist model hydrogen oxygen water large scale structure relative underlying reality much smaller scale material whizzing interreacting whatever happens vicinity utterly oblivious larger scale structure devoid purpose potential building block purpose modern physic devoid purpose scale assertion modern physic way vindicates aristotelian notion purpose motion changewell assertion plain wrong,feser,2458,0
2258,"A rather lively discussion concerning LFW which has long been lacking with respect to divine freedom (and to a more indirect extent, modal collapse).      @RunDec @Walter      As far as I can tell, there has been a hidden assumption about event causation here: namely ""choose x"" is some event then leading to ""x occurs"". That is completely wrong, in that it would destroy the unity of an action and would lead to a vicious regress regarding volition. Rather ""choose x"" and ""x occurs"" is a simultaneous causal relationship of an action of a volitional agent.      A better description of LFW here (in its most bare bones form as self- generated action; deliberation is a type of it) is not so much in weighing scales, but something like picking a point on a circle: namely, insofar as the formula of a circle only provides an undifferentiated sea of possibles but no actual ones, I have to actualize some particular point, and prior to that actualization, the point is just a mere possible, not something with an individual actual reality; it cannot even be considered of itself a true individual reality apart from my actualization.      You could say that relies on a dubious notion of an infinity of options, but the basic idea does not change even for finite options. Suppose I have C = {X, Y}. C taken of itself is just an undifferentiated sea of possibles, to get X I would need C[0] while for Y I would need C[1]. That caused ""indexing"" is just what a self-determined action is. Since that ""indexing"" is not prior to the action but simultaneous with it, it is self-determined and free; nor is it some random ""coin flip"" because the 0ing and 1ing are not some earlier floating states (which would also generate a vicious regress as above) but coincident with the volition itself. In fact, it is more accurate to describe ""0ing"" and ""1ing"" as descriptions of self-determinations, not as ""things"".

Under the cover of ""upstanding"" right wing politics, various authors are promoting occultism, while spouting edifying Christian vocab left right and centre.      Here's one example. Michael Warren Davis has done the rounds about Catholic places, having been published quite a bit - in First Things, Crisis Magazine, the Catholic Herald. He is out and about elsewhere too - in The Imaginative Conservative, where he declares he can only slightly disagree (on an issue of art and beauty) with the late Roger Scruton. He recommends Scruton's work ""On Hunting"" as ""an account of tradition from the living heart of that tradition"". The living heart of Idealism, more likely! This is the work that defines God as ""the subjectivity of the world""!      This is not what concerned me the most (I've mentioned it here before, but almost nobody seemed to think it of much interest - no doubt they were too busy reading the ST to notice).      Davis has authored a couple of articles at The American Conservative that are extremely dangerous to politicised Catholic conservatives. One of them ""When Witchcraft was Right-Wing"", depicts the witch Gerard Gardner and his followers as typically right wing. Davis doesn't defend devilry, but the article is bizarrely non-committal on this issue. Davis only gets a little emotional when pointing out how modern leftist witches are not true successors of Gardner!      His most recent article in TAC (""War Against the Modern World) definitely joined the dots. It is a shameless defence of ""Traditionalism"", well-known for occultism and virulent anti-Christianity in all its forms.. The only criticism he allows is that Evola is not so nice because Mussolini and Dugin like him, so Evola - bad. But Guenon - good! And looney tunes King Charles loves Guenon, so he's great too. Steve Bannon is somewhere between Guenon and Evola, so Davis says he ain't perfect.      These ""Traditionalists"" are now producing such volumes of material that those with doubts - real Thomists included, must feel it is useless to respond. It shouldn't be so difficult. After all, the dressing up of esoteric ideas with religious imagery is not new. Though Jonathan Pageau's defence of the Kabbala, and the occult, if only as a ""concept"" or aspect of ""Christianity"" was really going a bit far, even for one of ""them"".      The minds of well-meaning readers, including Catholics, need to be warned about Davis and authors like him.

The founders of modern physics (Heisenberg, Bohr, Born etc...) understood that the ontology behind classical physics had been proven wrong by experimental results that could only be explained through quantum mechanics. Heisenberg understood that physicists must now resign themselves (see below). This means that physics is no longer ontological at all but now presupposes existence (this was always the case but classical, Newtonian physics made it easy to neglect this fact). If you want ontology you have to go to philosophy which inevitably leads to theology (see Przywara ""Analogia Entis"").      “...The atomic physicist has had to resign himself to the fact that his science is but a link in the infinite chain of man's argument with nature, and that it cannot simply speak of nature ""in itself"".

1837,"In support of your point, can we say that one essential factor differentiating magisterial and non-magisterial acts is the manifested will of a bishop to bind to obedience the faithful under his authority to adhere (at least in some degree) to a particular teaching?      Vatican II said of the Ordinary Magisterium, 'In matters of faith and morals, the bishops speak in the name of Christ and the faithful are to accept their teaching and adhere to it with a religious assent. This religious submission of mind and will must be shown in a special way to the authentic magisterium of the Roman Pontiff, even when he is not speaking ex cathedra; that is, it must be shown in such a way that his supreme magisterium is acknowledged with reverence, the judgments made by him are sincerely adhered to, according to his manifest mind and will. His mind and will in the matter may be known either from the character of the documents, from his frequent repetition of the same doctrine, or from his manner of speaking.' (Lumen Gentium 25)      As with Vatican I's dogma of papal infallibility, I would think that this is intended by Vatican II as a description to be also applied retrospectively, even if in the 7th century they were not yet thinking about it in these explicit terms.      The 'manifest mind' of a pope refers especially to the doctrinal content of a document; his 'manifest will' refers especially to his intention to teach and bind the faithful of the world. Normally he will not express this intention in so many words, but it can be known 'either from the character of the documents, from his frequent repetition of the same doctrine, or from his manner of speaking.'      But as a minimum, the intention to somehow bind the faithful of the world would require the intention to promulgate the teaching to the faithful of the world (not just sending a letter to one individual, leaving it to his choice and initiative to promulgate to the world as he saw fit).      The Holy See these days generally publishes a papal teaching document (including letters to individuals or groups) in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis if the pope's intention had been to promulgate that document to all the faithful - thus confirming that it has at least some level of magisterial authority.      Was it the intention of Pope Honorius that his letters to Patriarch Sergius be promulgated to the Catholic world as binding (albeit non-definitive) teaching? It does not appear so, and the condemnations of Honorius by the Ecumenical Councils do not require us to think this either.      Just as his letters do not fall within Vatican I's description of the papal Extraordinary Magisterium, neither, apparently, do they fall within Vatican II's description of the papal Ordinary Magisterium. And therefore, neither do they provide a precedent showing that a teaching of the papal Ordinary Magisterium can be not merely in error, but heretical.",support point say one essential factor differentiating magisterial non-magisterial act manifested bishop bind obedience faithful authority adhere least degree particular teaching vatican ii said ordinary magisterium matter faith moral bishop speak name christ faithful accept teaching adhere religious assent religious submission mind must shown special way authentic magisterium roman pontiff even speaking ex cathedra must shown way supreme magisterium acknowledged reverence judgment made sincerely adhered according manifest mind mind matter may known either character document frequent repetition doctrine manner speaking lumen gentium vatican dogma papal infallibility would think intended vatican ii description also applied retrospectively even th century yet thinking explicit term manifest pope refers especially doctrinal content document manifest refers especially intention teach bind faithful world normally express intention many word known either character document frequent repetition doctrine manner speaking minimum intention somehow bind faithful world would require intention promulgate teaching faithful world sending letter one individual leaving choice initiative promulgate world saw fit holy see day generally publishes papal teaching document including letter individual group acta apostolicae sedis intention promulgate document faithful - thus confirming least level magisterial authority intention pope honorius letter patriarch sergius promulgated catholic world binding albeit non-definitive teaching appear condemnation honorius ecumenical council require u think either letter fall within vatican description papal extraordinary magisterium neither apparently fall within vatican description papal ordinary magisterium therefore neither provide precedent showing teaching papal ordinary magisterium merely error heretical,feser,2927,0
34,"A reasonable optimism says that in most cases most people’s consciences are correct. Thus typically we would expect that most violators of a legitimate law will not be acting out of conscience—for a necessarily condition for the legitimacy of a law is that it does not conflict with a correct conscience. Thus, even if there is the rare murderer acting from mistaken conscience, most murderers act against conscience, and by incentivizing abstention from murder, in most cases the law _helps_ people follow their conscience, and the small number of other cases can be tolerated as a side effect. Thus the considerations of conscience favor intolerant laws in such cases. Nonetheless, there are cases where most violators of a law would likely be acting from conscience. Thus, if we had a law requiring eating meat, we would expect that most of the violators would be conscientious. Similarly, a law against something—say, the wearing of certain clothes or symbols—that is rarely done except as a religious practice would likely be a law most violators of which would be conscientious.",reasonable optimism say case conscience correct thus typically would expect violator legitimate law acting conscience—for necessarily condition legitimacy law conflict correct conscience thus even rare murderer acting mistaken conscience murderer act conscience incentivizing abstention murder case law help people follow conscience small number case tolerated side effect thus consideration conscience favor intolerant law case nonetheless case violator law would likely acting conscience thus law requiring eating meat would expect violator would conscientious similarly law something—say wearing certain clothes symbols—that rarely done except religious practice would likely law violator would conscientious,pruss,1084,1

1272,"Hi Mister Geocon and Oktavian,      Belief in the Curse of Ham has a long Catholic pedigree. Most of the following quotations are taken from Adiele's book.      Several Church Fathers (e.g. St. Basil of Caesarea, St. John Chrysostom, St. Ambrose, St. Augustine of Hippo) all taught that the human institution of slavery had its origin in Ham's sinfulness. They did not link this to Africa. However, St. Jerome disturbingly refers to ""Ethiopians"" (Kushites) as ""black and cloaked in the filth of sin,"" adding: ""At one time we were Ethiopians in our vices and sins. How so? Because our sins had blackened us.""      Surprisingly, the first text to explicitly link the curse of Ham to Black Africans was the Babylonian Talmud, completed around 600 AD.      In the tenth century, Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria (877-940) was the first Christian Church leader to identify Black Africans as being among those afflicted by the Curse of Ham:      “Cursed be Ham, and may he be servant of his brothers...He himself and his descendants, who are the Egyptians, the Negroes, the Ethiopians, and it is said the   Barbari.”      According to the famous Christian geographical work ""Cursor Mundi"" (1300 A.D.), Noah's son Shem and his descendants were freemen who dwelt in Asia. Japhet and his descendants were nobles and knights who came to live in Europe, while ""Ham, the accursed"" and his descendants were slaves who were sent to Africa.      In the 15th century, the famous Portuguese chronicler Gomes Eannes de Azurara (1410-1474) appealed to the writings of a 12th century archbishop of Toledo, Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada (1170-1247) to support his contention that Black Africans were doomed to servitude because they were the accursed descendants of Ham:      ""The servitude of non-Muslim Moors (West Africans) resulted from the curse, which,   after the Deluge, Noah laid upon his son Ham, cursing him in this way: 'that his race   should be subject to all the other races of the world. And from his race these Blacks are descended,' as wrote the Archbishop Don Roderick of Toledo and Josephus in his Book on the Antiquities of the Jews, and Walter, with other authors who have spoken of the generations of Noah from the time of his going out of the Ark.""      In the 15th century, Dominican Friar Johannes Annius of Viterbo (1432-1502) wrote that the curse of Ham forced him into exile in Africa: “As a result of his sin, Ham is exiled to Africa.”      In the 18th century, French biblical scholar and Benedictine abbot Augustine Calmet (1672-1757) wrote in a work titled “Dictionary of the Holy Bible” (1722): “Noah assigned to Ham the nations of Africa. The occasion of the color of his sons was that Noah being one day asleep discovered his nakedness, and Ham passed that way without covering him; on which accounts his descendants are born with black complexion, and the gift of the prophecy was taken from them.”      In the 19th century, John England, the first Catholic bishop of Charleston, USA, wrote in a letter to US Secretary of State John Forsyth (1780-1841) that the enslavement of Black Africans was entirely lawful, because of the sin committed by their ancestor, Ham:      “Since every Catholic must accept Adam's fall as an essential ingredient in the human condition, he should likewise believe that it certainly was not then against the divine law for Shem and Japheth to use the services of the Black race, since their progenitor had been cursed by God for his sinful conduct.”      Finally, Pope Pius IX issued a Prayer for the Conversion of Africa through the Office of the Sacred Congregation of Rites on October 2, 1873, in which he declared: ""“Let us pray for the most wretched Ethiopians in Central Africa, that Almighty God may at length remove the curse of Cham from their hearts, and grant them the blessing to be found only in Jesus Christ, our God and Lord."" This prayer came with a 300-day indulgence.      Is it ""kind of bonkers"" to say that the Curse of Ham was a major influence on Catholic thought? I think not.",hi mister geocon oktavian belief curse ham long catholic pedigree following quotation taken book several church father eg st basil caesarea st john chrysostom st ambrose st augustine hippo taught human institution slavery origin sinfulness link africa however st jerome disturbingly refers ethiopian kushites black cloaked filth sin adding one time ethiopian vice sin sin blackened u surprisingly first text explicitly link curse ham black african babylonian talmud completed around ad tenth century patriarch eutychius alexandria - first christian church leader identify black african among afflicted curse ham “ cursed ham may servant brothershe descendant egyptian negro ethiopian said barbari ” according famous christian geographical work cursor mundi ad son shem descendant freeman dwelt asia japhet descendant noble knight came live europe ham accursed descendant slave sent africa th century famous portuguese chronicler gomes eannes de azurara - appealed writing th century archbishop toledo rodrigo jiménez de rada - support contention black african doomed servitude accursed descendant ham servitude non-muslim moor west african resulted curse deluge noah laid upon son ham cursing way race subject race world race black descended wrote archbishop roderick toledo josephus book antiquity jew walter author spoken generation noah time going ark th century dominican friar johannes annius viterbo - wrote curse ham forced exile africa “ result sin ham exiled africa ” th century french biblical scholar benedictine abbot augustine calmet - wrote work titled “ dictionary holy bible ” “ noah assigned ham nation africa occasion color son noah one day asleep discovered nakedness ham passed way without covering account descendant born black complexion gift prophecy taken ” th century john england first catholic bishop charleston usa wrote letter u secretary state john forsyth - enslavement black african entirely lawful sin committed ancestor ham “ since every catholic must accept fall essential ingredient human condition likewise believe certainly divine law shem japheth use service black race since progenitor cursed god sinful conduct ” finally pope pius ix issued prayer conversion africa office sacred congregation rite october declared “ let u pray wretched ethiopian central africa almighty god may length remove curse cham heart grant blessing found jesus christ god lord prayer came -day indulgence kind bonkers say curse ham major influence catholic thought think,feser,4040,0

3366,"@Miguel      It might be framed this way: Under what conditions do we ""instruct the ignorant"" and under what conditions to we ""rebuke the sinner"". The simple answer to each of these questions is straight forward. We do the former when dealing with someone who is ignorant (but not malicious) and that latter when someone is a sinner (i.e. malicious but not ignorant; they know it is wrong and don't really care). This entails that we are able to recognize and distinguish malice and ignorance. I think learning to do this effectively is critical for being able to effectively win people to the truth. If you rebuke a sincerely mistaken person for their mistake, this is unnecessary. Such a person just needs instruction. If you give instruction to a malicious person, this is uneffective because they don't care at all about the truth. Such a person doesn't need to be taught, he needs to be rebuked. This lies behind Aristotle's saying that we should not argue with those who deny manifest principles. Such folks need ""the rod"" and not instruction.

3463,"@ Anonymous:       _Hand waving away consciousness by saying it is caused by evolution is the cause of it, you haven't done anything to address the substance of the philosophical arguments about why consciousness is so weird._      Naturalists say that when brains reach a certain level of ""complexity"", they become conscious (something ""emerges""). And what does that mean? That's just the process of **eduction of the substantial form from the potentialities of prime matter,** described by Aquinas 700+ years ago.      That means that the forms (ADN) are in the potency of prime matter (chemicals) and are then drawn out into act through the agency of the efficient cause (the powers existing in the environment). Once you reach the ""threshold of complexity"", the form appears and so do the new properties and powers, like being self-conscious and being capable of abstract thinking.      So naturalists have reached the same conclusion that St. Thomas did. But St. Thomas had a coherent, hyper-extense, detailed up to the point of exhaustion metaphysical system. They claim ""emergence"" but they can not offer an explanation for it, that's why they hide under the cover of ""Natural Selection"" and her wondrous powers. And that's too why they hide under the cover of ""deep time"" as a last ditch effort to look credible. Naturalists, those ""wondrous powers"" pertain to God and only to God.      So for those who say that our system is ""archaic and obsolete"", I respond that the last laugh is on the hylemorphist. A deep, ample, sustained laugh.

So, that makes every attempt to use logic to argue for God completely futile.""      I have not ""admitted"" anything.      An infinite random sequence such as I have described is just a limited model of simplicity that is also, in some sense, about something that is not known or accessible, or understood by someone. Applied to my free will, it would not mean that my free will choices are not ordered to anything. It means, assuming its validity, that whatever process I use to arrive at a decision is beyond your ability to know, understand, or predict, using whatever measurement or calculation you care to try.      I don't use logic to argue for the existence of God, at least not logic alone. I use observation. I open my eyes and see what God has made as in Romans 1:20. The logic part starts with an assumption: ""There must be a simple unifying cause of all of creation"". What we know as ""science"" cannot fill the role of logic in the argument. Science is not remotely simple, but is highly complex. The simpler explanation, we call God. It is, in fact, a definition.      ""If, given a finite amount of time, I will arrive at a point when death ends the process, then it is simply a matter of random chance.""      No, my free will choice is random to you, not to me. You cannot understand how I choose or predict what I will choose, but that does not make my choice disordered. It just means that you cannot understand or predict it. You do not just ""happen"" to be a theist or an atheist when you die. Your intellectual part, private as described (the reason for modelling it as random), directs your free will (it can still deliberately choose wrongly), but such a deliberate wrong choice turns you from God, where you will stay if you die in refusal. Your knowledge of the love of God plays a role in the choice, but you freely make it.      ""it seems that God has waited just long enough for the first time Adam did something wrong to condemn him""      God did not condemn Adam or anyone else.      ""since he was the one who put the sequence there in the first place, He knew exactly what was going to happen and when it was going to happen""      The sequence is just a model of unpredictable simplicity. It is not an ordering of creation.      ""Adam, just like the rest of us, was always doomed and has always been in need of redemption.

When a moving object, say, a billiard ball, slows and stops it's motion is not lost, as Aristotle supposed, rather, it's kinetic energy of motion is transferred to kinetic energy of the surrounding environment, some of which goes to heating up the surrounding air. That effect is too small and too diffuse to be easily detected without instruments, so Aristotle did not realize this fact.

4650,"@Phil Tanny, I can appreciate the desire to avoid getting mired in perpetual kvetching, but it is untrue that unless I can provide an alternative solution, I have no right to dismiss or reject an idea.      I also disagree with the problem statement and the premise that the solution involves some kind of massive payout by the so-called 1%. First, a wealth disparity between racial groups is not per se a problem to be solved. Second, if it is a problem, it isn't necessarily the result of any kind of racism in any tangible sense. It could be cultural, and I claim that the problem is largely cultural (for example, Thomas Sowell, for example, opines that the disintegration of the black family beginning in the 1960s, often assisted by well-meaning social programs, has had a devastating effect on black Americans; I would also mention ideologies of perpetual powerlessness and victimhood that both demoralize and divert energy away from constructive activity toward ineffectual grievance and blame). Third, even if it were racist, I don't see what the rich have to do with it unless you can show that they employ racist policies specifically to impoverish certain racial groups (the targeting of the rich under the pretext that they benefit from a rigged system is the kind of sloppy and unjust rationalization I would expect from a Marxist who foments class conflict). Fourth, throwing money at problems is precisely what (per Sowell) created much of the problems we're seeing today. NGOs, often run by wealthy philanthropists, offer a relevant example of how funneling money and free goods into causes can cause more damage than it solves (the destruction of the Nigerian cotton and textile industry through mitumba, the destruction of Haitian farming through free rice given long after a crisis has passed, even something like the effect of TOMS on African shoe manufacturing and repair). I'm not saying *charitable* work cannot help, but I would be very suspicious of any ""philanthropic"" or even government-mandated solution given their track record. More importantly, no amount of money can solve the basic problem which, again, is cultural. Maybe Catholic missionaries could play a role here. The Catholic Church is, after all, what turned even the pig-chasing savages of Europe into something resembling a civilization. Only after the Church has given structure to the mission to lift black America out of spiritual and moral decay and, secondarily, poverty, does talk of money make sense because only then can it be used and allocated prudently and with care. But expect also a good deal of opposition from those who pretend to be concerned for such minorities, especially when the Catholic Church is involved and from those whose careers depend on maintaining the present status quo.",phil tanny appreciate desire avoid getting mired perpetual kvetching untrue unless provide alternative solution right dismiss reject idea also disagree problem statement premise solution involves kind massive payout so-called first wealth disparity racial group per se problem solved second problem necessarily result kind racism tangible sense could cultural claim problem largely cultural example thomas sowell example opines disintegration black family beginning often assisted well-meaning social program devastating effect black american would also mention ideology perpetual powerlessness victimhood demoralize divert energy away constructive activity toward ineffectual grievance blame third even racist see rich unless show employ racist policy specifically impoverish certain racial group targeting rich pretext benefit rigged system kind sloppy unjust rationalization would expect marxist foments class conflict fourth throwing money problem precisely per sowell created much problem seeing today ngo often run wealthy philanthropist offer relevant example funneling money free good cause cause damage solves destruction nigerian cotton textile industry mitumba destruction haitian farming free rice given long crisis passed even something like effect tom african shoe manufacturing repair saying charitable work help would suspicious philanthropic even government-mandated solution given track record importantly amount money solve basic problem cultural maybe catholic missionary could play role catholic church turned even pig-chasing savage europe something resembling civilization church given structure mission lift black america spiritual moral decay secondarily poverty talk money make sense used allocated prudently care expect also good deal opposition pretend concerned minority especially catholic church involved whose career depend maintaining present status quo,feser,2796,0

Certainly, the fact that something had been already _taught universally by the Fathers_ was considered sufficient evidence of its bona fides, without either a council or a papal declaration, and indeed its unanimous affirmation by the Fathers _was USED by the Councils_ as the basis for their dogmatic definitions.

2062,"@ Tadeo,      I cannot speak for Ed, but I was not arguing for or against natural selection per se. I disentangle truth and natural selection, as science, through my idea that, since a random sequence is a valid image of God, and since we know through quantum mechanics that there is such a thing as a random sequence, a random sequence, being without rules, is a very simple image of God, who also is without rules.      But God is greater than this or any other image, and is in no way limited by this image. So questions about consciousness do not restrict this image. What it is useful for, to we humans, is to show that we cannot calculate, with our mathematical science, what God's acts will be or are, since we cannot calculate a number (a sequence) whose digits are without a rule (are random), and, since God is truth, this separates truth from natural selection. In short, it is beyond our understanding (at least for me) to know whether natural selection is actual science, although as a theory of science, as Ed said in the video, (""natural selection favors fitness"") it explains adaption to the environment of survivors.      I can't see how your question can give a different answer without assumption, so I can't see it as a real question because the answer is either beyond our understanding, or follows from the arbitrary assumptions in its formulation.

2774,"My concern is not to assess Francis' personal responsibility or guilt (which we would best leave to God), or even to decide where he would stand in a ranking of popes from best to worst.      Rather, I think our aim should be to defend magisterial statements (albeit non-infallible) from charges of error or inconsistency as far as possible.      Quite a number of Francis' difficult statements are non-magisterial, so for these purposes it suffices to point that out in the particular instances.      With magisterial statements, I realise there is the last resort of withholding assent from non-infallible teachings, by someone who is sufficiently qualified and who has sufficient justifiying reasons. But once someone takes that step in one case, it does seem to easily become a habit, and a bottomless pit of doubt and dissent.      The typical Catholic trying to be faithful, and trying to learn more about their faith from Church documents, isn't in a good position to make these assessments, and they would end up with diminished confidence in a vast range of teachings if they became too easily habituated to having to exercise 'private judgment' upon each one.      So to me it's worthwhile, for the sake of both myself and others, to try to find another way if possible.      In this specific matter of whether we should try to 'convert others' - if we too easily take the most 'anti-evangelizing' interpretation of Francis' words, there will be those who will feel obliged to 'obediently accept' his teaching thus interpreted, with detriment to their own evangelizing efforts.

3585,"To put things in perspective it's worth remembering that Pope Benedict helped engineer Vatican II and Pope Francis sees his mission as loyalty to this thing. Many of the conservatives who most dislike Pope Francis also happen to like aspects of Vatican II, for instance, its untraditional teaching on religious liberty. The spirit of the Council was keenly felt at the time and was understood as openness to the world. It was followed by John Paul II and his horrendous gatherings at Assisi and visits to mosques. Francis' provocations are no worse and have the same genealogy.      Now conservatives get excited because Pope Benedict criticised his successor. What did he have to say about the damaging actions of predecessor he canonised? Now some of these Capital T ""Traditionalists"" are attacking the constitution of the Church and the Papacy, in the name of ""tradition"". At the same time, they attack the post-Tridentine Church with Gallicanist arguments, yet they hate Archbishop Lefebvre, who was the most Roman bishop in France. Sick.

1933,"I want to pick up on something that Todd said, above:      _authoritative magisterium (i.e. non-infallible)_      I have seen phrases similar to this in many comments (not just blog comments, but (probably even more) news articles and editorial comments in published sources. I want to cry 'foul' on the idea of an ""authoritative magisterium"" of the pope, being somehow a distinct category from his other stuff that he teaches that is, you know, NOT ""authoritative"" or not ""magisterial"" or not ""authoritatively magisterial"".      **There ain't no sich category"".**      At least, that's what I am inclined to argue, though I am willing to be given better material to become educated on the issue.      Pope's generally don't go around stating which of their teachings are ""authoritative"" or ""magisterial"". By coming from a bishop, they automatically _participate_ in the magisterial office of the Church. That's it. All bishops participate in that office, and they are all _authoritative_ when they exercise their authority to teach. Period.      The bishops (all of them) _must necessarily_ participate in the magisterial office of the Church in order to be the agents by which a teaching be infallibly taught _by the universal magisterium of the bishops around the world_. If they can do it SOME of the time, then they **have** the role. And they all have the authority.      Now, there are indeed different _degrees_ by which those teachings enjoy the protection of the Holy Spirit. THAT's open to ""full"" versus something lesser. A pope has a heavier hand in that _being protected_ than other bishops, but his participation in the magisterial office isn't _utterly_ unlike that of the other bishops. He can still err (as proven), and (more importantly) _just like the other bishops_ his teachings are capable of DIFFERENT DEGREES of commanding that respect that comes under ""religious assent"" from the people of the Church. A pope, just like other bishops, teaches some things mildly, some things firmly, and some things _very_ firmly, without invoking the infallibility of an ex cathedra declaration. Similarly, popes (and other bishops) teach some things _in identical fashion_ as those before him for many centuries had, for some things, while on other things he sets out with a new metaphor, or a new explanation for an old doctrine, and _all the degrees in between_ that carry all the possible degrees of assertiveness.      AND THEY DON'T SIT THERE TELLING US WHERE EACH STATEMENT LANDS on these scales of firmness, traditionalness, etc. Indeed, if anything, the popes and bishops are _highly_ reticent to STATE EXPLICITLY anything about how firmly our obligation of religious assent kicks in for most of the things they say. We are left discerning that by _various markers_ that are available, including tradition, tone of 'voice', type of teaching occasion or document, etc. But (short of a solemn declaration by an ecumenical council) these markers make such discernment a chore and often only _probable_. Such, I think, is the life of the educated Catholic.      I would propose that the only teaching stuff that comes from the bishops that is ""not magisterial"" is the stuff that they themselves SAY is uncertain, putting in qualifiers like ""I feel that this is right, but I don't insist upon it"" and ""there is room for disagreement on this"" and so on. Everything else is ""teachings"" and therefore is magisterial. That's what the office of bishop implies.",want pick something todd said authoritative magisterium ie non-infallible seen phrase similar many comment blog comment probably even news article editorial comment published source want cry foul idea authoritative magisterium pope somehow distinct category stuff teach know authoritative magisterial authoritatively magisterial sich category least inclined argue though willing given better material become educated issue generally go around stating teaching authoritative magisterial coming bishop automatically participate magisterial office church bishop participate office authoritative exercise authority teach period bishop must necessarily participate magisterial office church order agent teaching infallibly taught universal magisterium bishop around world time role authority indeed different degree teaching enjoy protection holy spirit open full versus something lesser pope heavier hand protected bishop participation magisterial office utterly unlike bishop still err proven importantly like bishop teaching capable different degree commanding respect come religious assent people church pope like bishop teach thing mildly thing firmly thing firmly without invoking infallibility ex cathedra declaration similarly pope bishop teach thing identical fashion many century thing thing set new metaphor new explanation old doctrine degree carry possible degree assertiveness sit telling u statement land scale firmness traditionalness etc indeed anything pope bishop highly reticent state explicitly anything firmly obligation religious assent kick thing say left discerning various marker available including tradition tone voice type teaching occasion document etc short solemn declaration ecumenical council marker make discernment chore often probable think life educated catholic would propose teaching stuff come bishop magisterial stuff say uncertain putting qualifier like feel right insist upon room disagreement everything else teaching therefore magisterial office bishop implies,feser,3468,0
3675," _The ""form"" is not an illusion in the sense that it doesn't exist at all, it is an illusion because it doesn't exist as a somehow semi-independent quality._      The problem is that this really doesn't solve the problem; other than a chair, the problems of reducing the function of sensory organs to mere arrangements is more apparent. But that should be there minor quibble here. (It should be said though that the chair in itself has ascribed properties it mere parts lack, e.g. its shape, which makes the mereological nihilism you're hinting at quite implausible. Ever the more so for a biological organ)      More importantly, the goal should be to undermine skepticism. And this is actually only possible if we suppose that a function is fulfilled here. An eyeball displaying illusions is only wrong (wrong as the normative judgment that it's not doing its job) insofar as there is an objectively correct mode of observation that the eyeball in question is incapable to represent. That is only something a form with a corresponding final cause is able to sustain. In either the atomist or the monist worldview, this idea has no room, since the arrangement is always only shape-wise, an imitation instead of a real member. If we take the two options seriously we have no reason to assume the observed data we're witnessing is actually reality representing.      Of course we can't guarantee that with the Aristotelian conception either, after all they could malfunction right now. But the point is, similar to the debate about causation of contingent events, which worldview actually allows us rationally to employ phenomenal conservatism, and that's just what Koons describes here.      Side note, purpose doesn't necessarily mean purposefully shaped or done that way, but also can refer to functions and usability.

3272,"Hi Ed,      You write that ""Honorius, unlike Agatho, was capable of erring in his own letter because he was not there speaking ex cathedra."" I have to say that this statement is anachronistic. The term ""ex cathedra"" dates from the Middle Ages, and the modern doctrine of papal infallibility was first proposed by bishop Guido Terreni in 1332. To be sure, the formula of Hormisdas (519) declares that ""in the Apostolic See the Catholic religion has always been kept unsullied,"" but (a) it was written before Honorius became Pope, (b) it refers to the Apostolic See, not the Roman Pope, and (c) it says nothing about there being different categories of papal pronouncements (reformable and irreformable).      You also suggest that in the case of a future Pope who, while not speaking ex cathedra, nevertheless teaches error, the Church ""will come to judge harshly any pope who fomented such a crisis."" I'm not so sure. The reason why the third ecumenical council of Constantinople (680-681) was able to condemn Pope Honorius was precisely because its bishops had never been handpicked by him, whereas today, all bishops in the Latin Church are appointed by the Pope, and typically, most of the Cardinals who will elect the next Pope were handpicked by the current one. Thus it appears extremely unlikely that the bishops, speaking in unison, will judge any Pope harshly.

2650,"This is the right approach, however, from what I've read so far it's overcomplicated by Aristotle and Aquinas. The Greek model for human rights is not universal but tied to the idea of AUTOCHTHONY and would JUSTIFY chattel slavery.   Paul addressed AUTOCHTHONY directly in his Mars hill discourse in Acts 17 countering the dispute concerning birth from a particular area to one BLOOD, in law a common human consanguinity which having the evidence of mixed races or ethnicities is evidence of common humanity due therefore common equity (dikaiosune, see Aristotle BOOK 5 NICHOMACHEAN ETHICS).   He then established the common observation that in one theos all live and move and have being which relates back to the first observation that they had many gods each of which protected certain classes of rights when given obeisance. The unknown one Theos being the god upon whom even the other gods demiurgos we're dependent.   Then he established the ideal judge who could advocate the natural rights of those in the image of the invisible Theos who is not in the image or location chosen by men but has established equity in the image of God in the god man in whom are all actual subjective rights obvious by natural law made objective because HE will judge in that equity, justice, righteousness, dikaiosune, mishpat and God has given proof of this by raising him from the dead signifying he is eternal and has the power over life and death for all in his image.   Paul draws this human rights argument directly from the old testament description of messiah the Christ not Greek philosophy he has simply explained it so that greeks could understand it. This is the same structure used in the prologue to John's Gospel, beginning with IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE LOGOS, the logos became flesh, that becoming flesh gave us equity and the authority to claim the title of an inheritance of rights i.e THE SONS OF GOD, our duty then, his law is to love and protect the legitimate rights of others as we love and protect our own rights, knowing these rights came from God by grace and the truth concerning the fact of the matter that is the Christ.   I don't see how philosophy can improve on this although it may help to understand it, but it doesn't improve upon but rather is corrected by the new testament based on the two great commandments with respect to God's rights and our rights in common as neighbors and the explanation in the prophets such as ISAIAH who goes into great detail on the subject of equity of rights in the human image of God YHVHJESUS.

3827," _I don't see how a 96 year old or 100 year old man can run the Church?_      Leo XIII did pretty well.      _There is after all a reason why Cardinals 80 years or older cannae vote in Papal Conclaves._      I feel quite strongly that this is actually a definite mistake for the Church. I agree that a bishop, or cardinal in the Vatican, needn't be assumed to have an active role of governance in their 80's. But until a man has reached dementia, his wisdom into his 80's is a positive treasure for the Church, and a conclave to vote for a pope is not _physically_ taxing the way constant duties would be.      More importantly, having octogenarians retain their vote (if compos mentis) is an _important_ stabilizer for the Church. In holding office now for just under 10 years, Francis has virtually re-made the college of cardinals in terms of its voting members, by ""stacking"" the deck with just about 65% of the voting cardinals. If he holds even one more consistory, he will push that well over 67%. And given that Francis, unlike his predecessors, has been appointing men in his own mold, his choosing will have a predominant influence over the voting _even though he won't have appointed half the cardinals_.      On the whole, while _there is_ a serious issue with a man like bishop or pope holding office into his dotage, where it is not he who is governing but his appointed subordinates, it is not best solved with an automatic retirement age. This fact has been handily shown in secular affairs. Other mechanisms are called for. For bishops, for example, instead of having them submit their resignation at 75, it should be possible for him to appoint a group of 5 (his own) trusted subordinates (including at least 1 or 2 doctors) to ascertain his capacity for ongoing independent decision-making and certify this to the pope.      As for the pope, while I can see that having a similar mechanism might be a very bad idea, I also see that the Church managed for 2000 years with old popes, many of whom gradually lost their ability to function and died in office. I do not think that the most recent example, Benedict, is a great shining example of a pope stepping down at ""the right time"": maybe, maybe, he had some disabled capacity that he had not disclosed (and never did disclose) that was clearly the sort of disability under which he could not execute the office of pope. But...wouldn't it have been better to _disclose_ exactly that which made his choice necessary? And that's the crux: from the example of 260 prior popes, resignation should not be an ""option"" like retiring from your job, where you can either stay or go depending on your preferences; it should only chosen out of necessity, and the _necessity_ (typically) can be exhibited at least in general form, and _should_ be made public in justice to those for whom he is the ""servant of the servants of the poor"". Possibly Pope JPII overdid the idea of staying in office and offering up his suffering while trying to muddle through, but it is equally possible that Benedict overdid the idea of leaving before his encroaching incapacity harmed the Church.      We will not and _cannot_ know for sure, and I don't presume to judge Benedict. God knows, and I hope and pray that God has already said to him ""welcome, my good and faithful servant.""

That would be as absurd as, say, a Platonist arguing that something other than the Form of the Good might in _principle_ be responsible for things having whatever measure of goodness they have, but that this is improbable given the empirical evidence. Or it is as absurd as a mathematician proposing that there is solid confirming empirical evidence that makes it probable that 12 x 48 = 576. The point isn’t that we don’t need to provide an argument for the claim that 12 x 48 = 576, or for the claim that there is such a thing as the Form of the Good, or, again, for the claim that the world could not exist even in principle apart from God. The point, again, is that the _kind_ of argumentation we would have to give would not involve forming hypotheses and then coming up with ways to test them empirically.

At the end of this investigation, the findings from the historical sources available to this study unfortunately tended to answer this basic question in the positive. This slave trade was not only supported and approved by the Catholic   Church but also received the blessings of the popes for a good number of reasons.""

The soul cannot be free unless the body is. You cannot coherently claim to own a man's labor without claiming to own the man himself.

518,"Yes, I’d say that, if, in the case of nth expectation greater than c>0, someone takes SLLN (if it applies) as a reason to accept all the bets, then in your example they should refuse to accept all the bets – if they reason on the basis of a ‘with probability 1’ result in one case, they should also do so in the other. That said, you should take care to note exactly what the various authors are actually arguing.      Speaking for myself, I don’t think that any result about an actual infinity of bets, or even just about limits of finite sequences of bets, is in itself a good reason to do anything. (Though, of course, such results can give useful hints.) What matters is the likely position when the game ends, as, in the real world, it must.      In your example, the distribution of partial sums has progressively increasing variance and skewness. Roughly (if I’m thinking straight), variance of the nth partial sum grows like n, 3rd moment grows like (n^2)/2. The normalized 3rd moment (i.e. with the outcome divided by its s.d. to make the variance 1) grows like (n^(1/2))/2. If I were really offered this sequence of bets, with the option of choosing in advance how many to accept, I’d feel that for large n, things would get pretty hairy, way too hairy to justify accepting on the basis of the positive expectation, which only grows like ln(n)/2.

2052,"Obviously, one can go too far. A virtue is a mean between extremes, and just as one can be too _quick_ to attribute evil to others, so too can one be too _slow_ to do so. Aquinas does not say that we should _never_ judge another to have a bad motive. He says that we should not do so _if_ we lack sufficient evidence to make a certain judgment about the matter, _if_ our judgment tends to be clouded by dislike of the person, and so on. But with some people, it is possible dispassionately and objectively to judge from their patterns of behavior over time that they are indeed acting from bad motives. There is no sin in making such a judgment under such circumstances. On the contrary, a habitual refusal to do so can be a vice. As [I have discussed elsewhere](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2019/11/against-candy-ass- christianity.html), Aquinas argues that just as one can sin by being excessively angry or insufficiently affable or friendly, so too can one sin by being _insufficiently_ angry and _excessively_ affable in the face of grave evil. Dogmatic non-judgmentalism would be a similar moral failing. It is not Christ’s teaching, but a distortion of that teaching.",obviously one go far virtue mean extreme one quick attribute evil others one slow aquinas say never judge another bad motive say lack sufficient evidence make certain judgment matter judgment tends clouded dislike person people possible dispassionately objectively judge pattern behavior time indeed acting bad motif sin making judgment circumstance contrary habitual refusal vice discussed elsewherehttpsedwardfeserblogspotcomagainst-candy-ass- christianityhtml aquinas argues one sin excessively angry insufficiently affable friendly one sin insufficiently angry excessively affable face grave evil dogmatic non-judgmentalism would similar moral failing teaching distortion teaching,feser,1177,0
4053," _The Pope's teaching is different, because the Bishop of Rome is the successor of St. Peter,_      The non-infallible teachings of the popes can call forth from us a higher _degree_ of that religious assent we make to the Church's non-infallible teachings, than those of other bishops, because he is the successor of Peter.

927,"""It may matter for LFW where that Will came from, but it doesn't matter for my argument.""      How does it not matter for your argument, if whether or not the model counts as LFW depends on it? Of course if there is such a thing as this ""Will"" which determinately lead to vanilla rather than chocolate, we must be the ones to cause such a Will. Otherwise, again, we are in no control whatsoever of our actions - a Will just emerges (uncaused by us, hence beyond our choice or control) which then causes our actions. Of course it matters for your argument, since if your model is unacceptable for libertarian freedom proponents then it won't work as a defense against my claim (that LFW for humans already involves the issue of an agent being able to cause 2 distinct effects without a change in intrinsic properties).      ""What matters is that there is a Will to do X. And a will to do X is not thé same as a Will to do not X.""      And the problem - to repeat myself again - is that if we are to maintain libertarian freedom, we have to have caused this Will. Otherwise the Will- for-X just emerges beyond our control and determines that we do X, and this is no libertarian freedom.      But if we cause the Will-to-X we cannot require a further, second order Will- to-will-to-X, otherwise we end up in a regress. That's been my point for a while now. So it turns out that this ""Will"" isn't really required for our choices. It's a confused notion that would lead to an infinite, vicious regress.      The existence of a Will-to-X becomes superfluous, since even on the assumption that it exists we must be able to choose and cause it (or the Will-to-not-X) without requiring a further second order Will. So it turns out this ""Will"" is not really required for free actions. In the end, LFW requires that an agent be able to choose and cause X or ~X without a difference in intrinsic properties. If there is a Will-to-X, it does not determine X, and is not incompatible with the possession of a Will-to-not-X.",may matter lfw came matter argument matter argument whether model count lfw depends course thing determinately lead vanilla rather chocolate must one cause otherwise control whatsoever action - emerges uncaused u hence beyond choice control cause action course matter argument since model unacceptable libertarian freedom proponent work defense claim lfw human already involves issue agent able cause distinct effect without change intrinsic property matter x x thé x problem - repeat - maintain libertarian freedom caused otherwise will- for-x emerges beyond control determines x libertarian freedom cause will-to-x require second order will- to-will-to-x otherwise end regress point turn really required choice confused notion would lead infinite vicious regress existence will-to-x becomes superfluous since even assumption exists must able choose cause will-to-not-x without requiring second order turn really required free action end lfw requires agent able choose cause x x without difference intrinsic property will-to-x determine x incompatible possession will-to-not-x,feser,2009,0

835,"God can have all the necessary reasons to create in every possible world. And he knows these reasons by knowing himself.      If your problem is that you think these reasons have to be literal, existing separate things in the divine mind (and they cannot be identified with each other) then the problem isn't with divine creative freedom per se, but rather with the status of the multiplicity of divine ideas (""and 2 must be different from 5!""). That is a different problem. Speaking for myself it's not clear to me that divine ideas must literally exist as separate entities; the nature of knowledge and how (it seems to me) it's basically a ""transparent"" power whereby something is grasped by the knower and understood through itself seems to me compatible with God knowing different abstract facts by means of a single known concrete substance which is analyzed (a substance that happens to be the ground of all possibilia anyway, God), though I cannot hope to imagine it. I think what Dolezal has written on the divine ideas would also be very helpful here.      Thus God's personhood is grounded in impersonal notions like ""being"" and ""act"": for Thomists, these are what God is, primarily""      This misses the point. The point at that stage is precisely that ""being"" and ""act"" are NOT impersonal. Intelligence is an irreducible aspect of existence which some beings (like us) enjoy when they're not limited enough. God's personhood is not grounded in anything impersonal (that would be absurd); existence in its fullness is taken to be irreducibly personal. It's impersonal beings that just happen to be limited enough that they are unable to possess that dimension of being, so to speak. As the ultimate source of personhood and the unlimited actuality of the principle that is the basis of personhood, God is personal through and through.

633,"@ Walter Van den Acker,      The little logic puzzles that you are setting are tricks that you are playing on yourself.      ""If logic is contingent, so is God, because the proposition 'God exists' is, in that case, a contingent truth.""      Contingent logic and contingent truth are not the same thing. Logic is a procedure that, properly used, takes us from one truth to another. Contingent truth is not absolute truth. ""It takes an hour to swim across the lake"", depends on the lake, the person swimming, and other contingent factors. God knows all the contingencies. They are in the infinite sequence which is contingent to us, but not to God, who is absolute truth. Furthermore, the infinite sequence is an _image_ of God, a Divine Idea, meaning that God knows it. But an image of God is not God any more than the pixels in your digital photo of a tree are the tree. You cannot say that the tree does not have sap because the photo does not have sap. Similarly, you cannot say that God is contingent from the entertainment of an image of God. The image does not show what God is, but it shows what you cannot say that God is not. Because people, made in the image of God, can be stupid does not imply that God is stupid.      God has no procedure of using logic. God knows the procedure of logic that you use. He created it. That procedure, properly used, is whatever God wills it to be. Whatever he wills it to be, it still allows humans to reason from one contingent truth to another within the composite contingent truths that humans understand.

What is an “eternal act,” or knowledge that doesn’t produce a “metaphysical change” in the knower, or something willed “from everlasting”? Yes, your idea of God is immune to most atheistic attacks, but in securing this victory, you basically hollow out the definition so much that not only is there no trace left of a loving Father we can have a personal relationship with (not such a serious problem for religions like Buddhism, but a massive blow for traditional Christianity), but ‘God,’ identified as nothing more than a string of abstract concepts, is (like all abstractions) absolutely bereft of any concrete reality independent of a thinking subject.   Third leading from my second issue is are you a Pantheist David? I have read both yours and Ed Fesers blog sites and I recall you saying “The accusation of pantheism troubles me not in the least… There are many ways in which I would proudly wear the title… I am quite happy to be accused of pantheism.”   So, unless you were being facetious, I don't see how that doesn't confirm his and his followers' beliefs about you. You've also said that ""Pantheism is a vague term."" Well, the simplest definition is God=World that's it, he is immutable, indifferent, formless and eternal. However, is it possible that the accusations of pantheism are actually misunderstood as Panentheism?   Put simply, a Panentheist (also known as also known as Monistic Monotheism), is the belief, similar to Pantheism, that the physical universe is joined to God, but stressing that God is greater than (rather than equivalent to) the universe. Thus, the one God is synonymous with the material universe and interpenetrates every part of nature (as in Pantheism), but timelessly extends beyond as well. This conception of God influenced New England Transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, and was popularized by Charles Hartshorne (1897 – 2000) in his development of process theology in the 20th Century. The Neoplatonism (which you declare yourself a follower of) of Plotinus (in which the world itself is a God) is to some extent panentheistic with polytheistic tendencies, and philosophical treatises have been written on it in the context of Hinduism for millennia (notably in the “Bhagavad Gita” and the “Shri Rudram”). For more details on Panentheism I have provided a video link below, feel free to watch it.

But this of course reduces God’s internal reason to something less than or other than God, and that is something a classical theist, as I understand it, will not accept.

2935,"This is a new idea that I had not heard of. And I admit that there's room for more understanding, but I would hazard this:      By ""living uterus donation"" do you mean Jane, who is healthy, giving over her uterus to Sally, whose uterus is damaged and cannot be healed, so that Sally can conceive a and bear a child?      If we assume that Jane is not offering her uterus _in order to avoid conceiving_ , the contraceptive aspect of the perverted faculty argument is not applicable. If, for example, Jane is single and expects to stay that way, and stably has not been engaging in sexual relations, she can be presumed not to enter into this for contraceptive reasons. She is not perverting her faculty of reproduction.      Nor is Sally perverting her faculty of reproduction: her faculty is being impeded by a damaged organ, which (apparently) can be worked around by medical means. So far as ""faculty"" arguments go, this is morally licit.      The real weight of the moral difficulty is in Jane effectively maiming herself: it is not _generally_ reasonable to take away a functioning major body part. However, the ""generally"" I added there does imply reservations on how far that applies: it is (by most ethicists) considered moral for a person to donate one of his 2 kidneys to another whose kidneys have failed. This is even laudable: the donor can (for the most part) ""get by"" on one kidney - though they will live a life of increased risk, because they no longer have a ""back-up"" kidney to take over if one is not functioning.      Arguably, Jane can use the same approach to justify donating her uterus to a woman whose own uterus is damaged: if Jane isn't going to ""use it"", she can offer its use to another. However, I see potential quagmires here, and I don't think it's that simple. On the one hand, if Jane is single, on what basis is she _certain_ she will not marry? If she is married, on what basis is she able to definitively decide she won't be ""needing"" that uterus any more? (On the other hand, what if Jane has taken permanent vows of celibacy in a monastic order, and knows she will not be using her reproductive faculties for reproduction?)      Secondly, the reproductive organs are highly inter-related, and it is absolutely _not_ a given that ""because Jane won't be using the organs for reproduction"" doesn't altogether imply the organs have no health function in the body. This is manifestly true of the ovaries, and hormonal activity that regulates tons of other body functions than JUST reproduction. I don't have any knowledge of whether the uterus, like the ovaries, is involved in other activities for health. I suspect that (a) the medical system claims those health risks are minimal, and (b) that they _may_ be oversimplifying the case in saying so, but I don't actually know.      As to being involved in ""the system"": since there seems (to me, indicated above) that there is a plausible argument that the underlying donative action is morally licit _in some cases_ , it comes down to a prudential judgment whether the overall activity is _nearly always_ a donation precisely because Jane wants to avoid the possibility of pregnancy, i.e. whether working for it is supporting something that almost always is being done immorally, or not. If it is nearly always being done immorally with a contraceptive intent, it might be imprudent to _support_ the medical practice by aiding the research. If _not_ , i.e. if there seem to be plenty of cases (even if still in the minority) that are not donations for contraceptive intentions, then I think you can use a _general presumption_ of moral licitness of the individual cases, and this would seem to permit being involved in ""the system"" of medical support / research in the activity. But that's just my opinion.",new idea heard admit room understanding would hazard living uterus donation mean jane healthy giving uterus sally whose uterus damaged healed sally conceive bear child assume jane offering uterus order avoid conceiving contraceptive aspect perverted faculty argument applicable example jane single expects stay way stably engaging sexual relation presumed enter contraceptive reason perverting faculty reproduction sally perverting faculty reproduction faculty impeded damaged organ apparently worked around medical mean far faculty argument go morally licit real weight moral difficulty jane effectively maiming generally reasonable take away functioning major body part however generally added imply reservation far applies ethicist considered moral person donate one kidney another whose kidney failed even laudable donor part get one kidney - though live life increased risk longer back-up kidney take one functioning arguably jane use approach justify donating uterus woman whose uterus damaged jane going use offer use another however see potential quagmire think simple one hand jane single basis certain marry married basis able definitively decide needing uterus hand jane taken permanent vow celibacy monastic order know using reproductive faculty reproduction secondly reproductive organ highly inter-related absolutely given jane using organ reproduction altogether imply organ health function body manifestly true ovary hormonal activity regulates ton body function reproduction knowledge whether uterus like ovary involved activity health suspect medical system claim health risk minimal b may oversimplifying case saying actually know involved system since seems indicated plausible argument underlying donative action morally licit case come prudential judgment whether overall activity nearly always donation precisely jane want avoid possibility pregnancy ie whether working supporting something almost always done immorally nearly always done immorally contraceptive intent might imprudent support medical practice aiding research ie seem plenty case even still minority donation contraceptive intention think use general presumption moral licitness individual case would seem permit involved system medical support research activity opinion,feser,3791,0

3229,"@Tony      In Benedict XVI's Foreword to his book 'Jesus of Nazareth' published during his pontificate, he wrote, 'It goes without saying that this book is in no way an exercise of the magisterium, but is solely an expression of my personal search for the face of the Lord. Everyone is free, then, to contradict me. I would only ask my readers for that initial goodwill without which there can be no understanding.' (It was understood by everyone as being written in his capacity 'as a private theologian'.)      The book had a certain impact around the world of Catholic thought, as he no doubt wished - partly caused by his pre-existing reputation as a theologian, but certainly added to by the simple fact that he was now pope. He wanted to 'teach' people, in a similar way to us wanting to 'teach' each other by posting on this blog - hopefully our motive is that we want to help one another on the path to truth. And he wanted to use his new platform as pope to reach a wider audience.      However, Benedict didn't want Catholics to consider themselves morally bound to accept what he said, just from the mere fact of who it was that said it. I don't think that this was particularly because he was tentative or uncertain about his statements in the book - maybe for some of them he was, others he wasn't. But rather, he wanted in this case to leave acceptance of what he was saying simply up to the free consideration of the individual. He didn't wish to 'bind' anyone.      So, he took off his 'pope' cap and put on his 'private theologian' cap, saying that his writing was solely an expression of his 'personal search for the face of the Lord' (despite presumably being motivated by wanting others to learn from his words and to be influenced by them).      Is that swapping of caps problematic on your view? I'm reading you (maybe) as saying or implying that the assertions of a pope in faith or morals cannot fail to be 'binding' on any Catholic to some extent, whether the pope likes it or not; or maybe that this is so, at least by default. That is (maybe unless the pope explicitly says otherwise, as with Benedict's book), Catholics should consider themselves morally bound to adhere (at least to some degree) to a pope's assertions in faith or morals, merely from the fact of who it is that is asserting them. This would be whether or not they are published in an official document, and whether or not they are promulgated to the whole Church: it is all 'teaching', and by a representative of Christ, and therefore magisterial.      So on this view, the official but private replies of Pope Honorius to Patriarch Sergius would be 'binding' to some extent on any Catholic who learnt of them and their contents.      And the plane interviews of Pope Francis would be to some small degree magisterial (if they concern faith or morals) - calling for our acceptance of his statements from the mere fact of who it is that is speaking and 'teaching'.

4295,"Hi everyone,      Thanks you all for your responses.      Talmid, you write: ""Either it [Pure Existence] is infinite or it is finite. But if PE was finite them it would be a certain form of existence and so not PE, which is contradictory, so PE has to be infinite.""      What your argument really proves is that the notion of ""pure existence"" is utterly amorphous: it is not tied to any particular form. But by the same token, since it has no form, we cannot say that it is positively infinite, either; all we can say is that it has no positive characteristics at all.      RunDec, you object to my assertion that the alleged distinction between a thing's essence and its existence can be explained in terms of the form-matter distinction, by arguing as follows: ""the existence of an animal might require its material exemplification, but this is not the case with immaterial beings (such as souls, angels, God, or any other candidates).""      Re separated souls: at least we can say that they once had bodies and that they will one day have them back, so we can regard them as being ""branded,"" so to speak, by the matter they informed. Re angels: I'm sure you're well aware that there were many medieval philosophers who held that angels are not pure forms, but possess a kind of spiritual matter, allowing two or more angels to be of the same species. As for God, His essence and existence are commonly held to be identical, anyway.      You also ask, ""if God had an accident distinct from himself (his essence), where would this accident come from? It can't come from the essence lest you accept the precedence of a perfectly simple Essence which is the source of all things, which is what you're trying to avoid.""      I'm quite happy to say that God's essence is simple. What I insist is that God's Mind or Essence has multiple thoughts and intentions which are contingent accidents - e.g. God's concept of this universe, and His intention to make it.      You deny that having an intention is a necessary condition for making a choice because ""if it were, we would never be able to choose anything, since we would have to choose our intention before being able to make a choice, and that is circular or regressive."" However, your argument misconstrues my position, which is that an agent's choice to do something must be (at least logically, even if not temporally) preceded by a plan or intention to do it. Otherwise, it would be impossible to attribute an action A to spiritual agent X rather than spiritual agent Y, as neither of them would have done anything to identify it as the cause of A. But although I produce things (or states of affairs) as an agent, I do not ""produce"" my intentions; I just have them. They are voluntary, but not in the same sense that my actions are. My intentions have no prior cause; I just have them, and that's all. So too with God.      I don't have any problem with an agent either choosing to bring about X or choosing not to bring about X, and having an identical causal history in both cases. What bothers me is the notion of an agent acting without a plan. That just makes no sense. Cheers.      William,      While Ed doesn't deny that God is personal, He construes God's personhood in terms of His possessing an intellect (and will), which in turn is construed in terms of God being Pure Act and containing (eminently) every form which He generates, within Himself, since He is Pure Being. Thus God's personhood is grounded in impersonal notions like ""being"" and ""act"": for Thomists, these are what God is, primarily. I maintain that God has thoughts of His own, which are in some sort of Divine language, and these thoughts are what makes God personal.      I hope Ed spoils himself this Christmas and buys himself a copy of Professor Francesca Stavrakopoulou's ""God: An Anatomy."" It will change the way he thinks about the God of the Bible. Cheers.

1038,"I think people sometimes take original sin too much like a theory of physics. Once you do that it can lead to misunderstandings. Perhaps think of it instead as God creating nature with a telos, in fact a hierarchy of teloi, with everything drawn towards his divine idea(l)s (using Augustines terms). What the fall represents is us starting to choose our own sub-teloi, of having “knowledge” of what is “good” for us. Once we do the conscious choosing, we generally do a pretty bad job of it, as can be seen immediately with Cain, and that has consequences that ripple across everything. Like a stone thrown into a calm pond.      In order to recover our correct place in nature so that we can become participants in God’s original creation, working with him rather that towards our own faulty choice of sub-telos, we have to aim towards God’s original idea(l) of man.      Fortunately He has helped us hugely here. The incarnation was not just(!) the sacrifice that gained the reconciliation of the consequences of our bad choices, it also gave us the perfect example of the divine ideal we were created to be. So in choosing to be more like him, as far as we can in our puny efforts, we become participants in God’s great act of creation that is this universe (and we get help in this). On this path even the delights of the world become good, and we can have life to the full (though not without suffering yet).      If we don’t - but rather continue to create our own sub-teloi - then even good intentions can lead us away from completion, away from union with the creator. For those whose chosen teloi, their highest good and highest desires, are the base pleasures of the world, it is them who are choosing eternal torment.

Sure, the existence of an animal might require its material exemplification, but this is not the case with immaterial beings (such as souls, angels, God, or any other candidates). What you are pointing to is precisely the difference between Essence and Existence - that you can know what-a-thing-is without knowing that-a-thing-is. It's not the same as what form a thing has versus its material cause (which also could or could not exist). I don't know what you mean by ""Pure Existence"" being vague or not infinite but Aquinas has some pretty good arguments for why Pure Existence is infinite, divine, etc.      More importantly, why are you ignoring the entire rationale for Divine Simplicity? It seems to be a recurring thing among critics. You point apparent problems but then ignore the arguments given for simplicity.      I speak as a person who has no ulterior motives; I simply am convinced that the First Cause of all things must be absolutely simple. If it had parts, then it would be dependent upon those parts for its existence, and thus would not be perfectly independent. Yet cosmological arguments require a foundation that is entirely independent of anything, which just is necessary existence, unconditioned. A composite is always conditioned by its parts, its existence is always ""iffy"" and dependent on the parts. So if ""God"" had parts, the parts would be the First Principles, not the composite. And if you follow that along, you'll reach some really bad problems.   And if God had an accident distinct of himself (his essence), where would this accident come from? It can't come from the essence lest you accept the precedence of a perfectly simple Essence which is the source of all things, which is what you're trying to avoid. But there is nowhere for the accident to come from, then, and being an accident, it cannot exist ""by its own (non- substantial, hence conditioned and dependent) nature"". You know classical authors reflected a lot on these matters and didn't just adopt Divine Simplicity because of church teaching, right?      4- And yet the same happens with libertarian freedom for us as well. Before you make your choice, there is a point in which there is no difference in your properties between world 1 (where you go on to choose X) and world 2 (where you go on to not choose X). So do you reject libertarian free will for humans too? Since I accept LFW, I already cannot accept that objection.      If I had to accept it, though, I would rather embrace necessitarian emanationism or optimism etc. than reject Simplicity, speaking for myself.      5- This objection wouldn't just cut against Divine Simplicity; it would also cut against creation being the result of a free choice, given what I said in 4. And you seem to be presupposing that an explanans must determine the explanandum, which is very doubtful (especially if it would cost us standard free will explanations);      6- Again, don't care about what Scripture says in philosophical matters (philosophy and rational argument always comes first to me) but Divine Simplicity isn't incompatible with God being personal. God *is* personal, and literally so, since he is the ultimate source of personhood. He's just eminently personal by virtue of a greater perfection (a single one) which includes the actualities of all others in a unified way.",- care taught church ignore - also care scripture teach - getting essence existence confused form matter knowing whether tasmanian tiger exists matter knowing whether existence matter sure existence animal might require material exemplification case immaterial being soul angel god candidate pointing precisely difference essence existence - know what-a-thing-is without knowing that-a-thing-is form thing versus material cause also could could exist know mean pure existence vague infinite aquinas pretty good argument pure existence infinite divine etc importantly ignoring entire rationale divine simplicity seems recurring thing among critic point apparent problem ignore argument given simplicity speak person ulterior motif simply convinced first cause thing must absolutely simple part would dependent upon part existence thus would perfectly independent yet cosmological argument require foundation entirely independent anything necessary existence unconditioned composite always conditioned part existence always iffy dependent part god part part would first principle composite follow along reach really bad problem god accident distinct essence would accident come come essence lest accept precedence perfectly simple essence source thing trying avoid nowhere accident come accident exist non- substantial hence conditioned dependent nature know classical author reflected lot matter adopt divine simplicity church teaching right - yet happens libertarian freedom u well make choice point difference property world go choose x world go choose x reject libertarian free human since accept lfw already accept objection accept though would rather embrace necessitarian emanationism optimism etc reject simplicity speaking - objection cut divine simplicity would also cut creation result free choice given said seem presupposing explanans must determine explanandum doubtful especially would cost u standard free explanation - care scripture say philosophical matter philosophy rational argument always come first divine simplicity incompatible god personal god personal literally since ultimate source personhood eminently personal virtue greater perfection single one includes actuality others unified way,feser,3680,0

2972,"I agree that these two positions are distinct and should be kept apart for the purpose of recognizing whether either one is contrary to _what the Church teaches_. Von Balthasar's position is much less easy to attack as contrary, or as clearly and explicitly contrary.      But whether salvation for all it is something that we can ""reasonably"" hope for is not the same as whether it is clearly and explicitly contrary to what the Church teaches. Some teachings make it imprudent, unwise, or temerarious (rash) to propose, without being definitely opposed to Church teaching, because the Church teaching strongly **leans** in a certain direction without (yet) being _definitive_ about it. For example, the Holy Office stated over 100 years ago that it MAY NOT safely be taught that Christ in his human intellect did not have the knowledge of those in Beatitude during his period on Earth, nor even that the position be held as debatable or uncertain.      In addition to the (many) biblical passages that _at least point toward_ the result that some are damned, there are some passages whose import are (and have been taken traditionally as saying) that some are _in fact_ damned, rather than that some may be damned. And whether they have been ""traditionally"" taught so, versus ""Traditionally"" taught so, i.e. whether the weight of the apostolic and Fathers teachings' comes down definitively on one side of that, I hesitate to say, but then again perhaps _so should everyone else_. It may be **rash** to say (and teach) that all may be saved is a reasonable hope.      Nevertheless, one may certainly PRAY for all, in the sense of (a) having good will toward all; and (b) asking God to offer his favor to all; so that (c) all who _might be saved_ will indeed be saved. While your benevolence applies to all in that **any one** might be saved, and thus of any one you hope he be saved, it need not encompass an active hope that _every_ single one be saved.

4485,"David,      ""And it is absurd to bring to bear the (your) standards of human moral agency to attempt to critique what (little) you understand to be God's exercise of his moral agency.""      I think I can very much make a good analogy here. And my point is I believe I know some necessary moral facts which allow me to say what God can or cannot do (will or will not do). For instance, I am totally confident that it is impossible for God to create a universe consisting of nothing but children being burnt, tortured in horrible pain until they die and are annihilated - they don't even go to heaven eventually, nothing. I am confident that God cannot do that because it would be immoral.   So I can use my knowledge of morality to know what God can or cannot do. Of course, my knowledge will be limited and I could be mistaken about some things, but that goes for anything and it doesn't mean I can't draw rational conclusions here. And of some things I am very confident.      ""(what with ""ceteris paribus""* and all that -- wink wink) it's really not?""      The ceteris paribus clause is there just because I am open to human suffering possibly serving a greater good through e.g. soul-building theodicies, ""becoming stronger/virtuous through pain"", whatever. But the ceteris paribus version of the proposition is still true, and so human suffering is something that God should seek to alleviate/prevent, unless there is a stronger reason why he can't/shouldn't (and that is when we are led to theodicy).      ""But in any case, so what? What are you alleging against the Almighty here? That you're having trouble shaking the suspicion that you might have a better grasp of Necessary Moral Truths than he does?""      No? The point is that if God exists, he cannot fall short of the standards of necessary moral truths as I was talking about. (Indeed, for me he would be the Good itself, and the Good obviously cannot fall short of those moral facts; rather they are supposed to be reflections of the Good, which is only more reason to expect more of him than us, not less). And this sets up the problem of evil, because clearly the world is prima facie a pretty crappy place.      ""It's not that hard, actually. If God is indifferent to (e.g.) a child being tortured... (etc.)""      ""So again, back to the classic question: ""What if God was one of us,""      What if God is truly and perfectly good and wise.      ""But as you yourself say: ""In which case he would not be God, as God is supposed to be."" -- Right, but...""      Yeah, but the point is that the problem of evil is a challenge to God's existence. And it cannot be solved by holding that God, ""not a moral agent"", could really just be indifferent to horrible evils and do nothing about them, and so the existence of horrible evils ""could not possibly be incompatible with him"". This solution doesn't work unless one is okay with (absurdly) turning God into a seriously defective, irrational being, unworthy of worship (because this is what it would be entailed by it for most people, myself included). So the Davies line adds nothing to the problem; at the end of the day, we need the standard responses (skeptical theism, theodicies, etc.). Those responses come with an epistemic cost, but the theist must deal with that.

878,"@Anonymous @Talmid According to Judaism and the first ecumenical council the Catholic Church ever held, eating meat from animals that have been abused is a mortal sin, of the same gravity as fornication or idolatry.      ""You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, **from the meat of strangled animals** and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell."" - St. James the Just (Acts 15:29)      Practically speaking, because almost all forms of mass farming in the United States are far more abusive than the relatively tame practice of merely strangling animals of Ancient Rome, this means that anyone who knowingly buys meat from a mass farm or mass food supplier like Sysco (via a restaurant), knowing what the first church council wrote, with full consent of the will, has committed a mortal sin. In order to avoid falling into mortal sin, you must eat vegan whenever you eat out (or reduce animal product intake as much as possible) or buy animal products only from Kosher or Halal delis (because Jews and Muslims still hold fast to these rules).

1351,"WCB      Augustine assures us that God does not in fact cause our choices, God merely knows them. Which is obviously wrong if God creates eveything as it is. Which he also asserts. Creation is eternally happening. Caused by God. See Augustine's ""Confessions - Book XI"". Augustine never took all of this to its logical ends.. He never realized his claim that God did not cause our actions good or bad was logically and rationally wrong.      Augustine had some large conceptual blind spots. Which is theology's basic problem. Of course any theologian who realized this sort of problem confirmed classical theology was nonsense dared not admit it in writing publically. Not unless he find himself pronounced anathema, excommunicated, stripped of any offices he held, and losing any rights to teach in any University if he held a license to teach.

Jean Messlier was an example of a well respected priest who scorching opinions were only known posthumously.      Did Augustine abandon free will? Yes. Read the Council of Orange. Which followed Augustine until that turned out to be problematic.      Later, insisting free will was impossible as Augustine suggested became heresy. A monk, Gottshalk of Orbis, who insisted on Augustine's abandoment of free will was censuted and spent 20 years in prison, refusing to abandon that opinion. The Synod of Paris in the tenth century, pronounced that opinion heresy, utterly abandoning the Council Of Orange. Manuscripts about the Gottshalk affair only recently have been gathered and translated. I do not know if these have yet been published.      You might want to read the Council of Orange.      We have very little about the discussions of theologians of the time who realized Augustine's theology made God author and creator of all horrendous evil and suffering forcing abandment of that theology, but that in fact happen, and the Council of Orange, the end product of Augustian theology was quietly but thoroughly abandoned starting in the sixth century.

And as Pohle and Preuss note in their manual _God: His Knowability, Essence, and Attributes_ , against the traditional doctrine of divine perfection, it is precisely “Pantheists [who] object that ‘God plus the universe’ must obviously be more perfect than ‘God minus the universe’” (p. 188).",reviewhttpswwwthepublicdiscoursecom god commenting view creation follows inevitably nature noted “ hard see different trinitarian claim son necessity begotten father different creation le divine son ” necessitarian view creation thus one several respect noted review position collapse kind pantheism pohle preuss note manual god knowability essence attribute traditional doctrine divine perfection precisely “ pantheist object ‘ god plus must obviously perfect ‘ god minus ” p,feser,828,0

The two are not the same at all, even in our case. Second, 'compelling' reason is a metaphor; nobody is literally compelled by any reasons, which would require that reasons be efficient causes. All 'compelling reason' means is that it was a reason good enough due to its intrinsic merits that one acted on it. Because of this, while it is true that our creation shows that God had no compelling reason not to create, it is trivially true -- all it is saying is that God's making choice A shows that He didn't decide to act on the intrinsic merits of any reasons He might have had for choice B. It doesn't tell us anything about whether He had good reasons for choice B. Third, the response is irrelevant because the claim in question is ""nothing in God's nature contains a reason not to create"".

He led a mechanical, regular, almost abstract bachelor existence in a little retired street of Königsberg, an old town on the north-eastern frontier of Germany. I do not believe that the great clock of the cathedral performed in a more passionless and methodical manner its daily routine than did its townsman, Immanuel Kant. Rising in the morning, coffee-drinking, writing, reading lectures, dining, walking, everything had its appointed time, and the neighbors knew that it was exactly half-past three o'clock when Kant stepped forth from his house in his grey, tight-fitting coat, with his Spanish cane in his hand, and betook himself to the little linden avenue called after him to this day the ""Philosopher's Walk."" Summer and winter he walked up and down it eight times, and when the weather was dull or heavy clouds prognosticated rain, the townspeople beheld his servant, the old Lampe, trudging anxiously behind Kant with a big umbrella under his arm, like an image of Providence.      What a strange contrast did this man's outward life present to his destructive, world-annihilating thoughts! In sooth, had the citizens of Königsberg had the least presentiment of the full significance of his ideas, they would have felt far more awful dread at the presence of this man than at the sight of an executioner, who can but kill the body.

1555,"Someone explain ""measure"" to me in Aquinas. Like I'm five. Well maybe 25. This section of De Veritate for example:      Note, however, that a thing is referred differently to the practical intellect than it is to the speculative intellect. Since the practical intellect causes things, it is a measure of what it causes. But, since the speculative intellect is receptive in regard to things, it is, in a certain sense, moved by things and consequently measured by them. It is clear, therefore, that, as is said in the Metaphysics, natural things from which our intellect gets its scientific knowledge measure our intellect. Yet these things are themselves measured by the divine intellect, in which are all created things—just as all works of art find their origin in the intellect of an artist. The divine intellect, therefore, measures and is not measured; a natural thing both measures and is measured; but our intellect is measured, and measures only artifacts, not natural things.      Is a measure, measures, is measured...what is happening? I think ""measure"" and I picture someone with a ruler walking up to a sofa or whatever and thinking: I wonder if that will fit in my living room. Hm. I will measure it and then we will see. That's it. But Aquinas is taking some basic meaning of this word and extending it to a host of other things, and I can't quite grasp what that is.

But if we come to focus on other points like their appeal to nominalism, they suffer from the same problems that Ed emphasized in TLS and Scholastics meta. The points like how they can even communicate with themselves if there are no universals - or even worse if there are just ""momentary beings"". But I think that their denial of universals has some relation with their momentariness thesis. And that's what I can't even understand in the first place. How can someone think that something analogous to the Heraclitean position is right in the first place? It's illogical. And someone might even say that, correctly, that the ""buddhist logic"" is very different from ""Aristotelian logic"". Fair enough. But that doesn't explain why someone might think that something so absurd as ""impermanent beings"" (let alone mereological nihilism, nominalism) is plausible in the first place. To affirm that ""there are no pots that last longer than a moment"" and that ""there is just a series of ephemeral pots one after another"" is not to disprove permanence, but to evade the problem altogether.

1713,"Tadeo,      This is a great question that has been considered by great theologians like St. Augustine. The answer lies partly in God's relationship to time. God does not learn things that occur in history. He sees them all in one glance because he is outside time. He is not bound by it, but he is the cause of the existence of all that is bound by time. So in one glance He sees all things and He sees all things in relation to Himself. This pertains to Aristotle's thought thinking self. God knows all things as being caused by Himself. He sees in Himself the cause of all things and sees all things as caused by Him. This entails that all things (such as our prayers) can only be known in the full sense with reference to God who is the cause of our existence while praying and the cause of the very beings about which are prayers are concerned (e.g. our children or parents or friends, etc). This pertains also to His Will because, in seeing all things at once, He does not will things in acts that are temporally distinguished. In the unity of the Divine Will flowing out of the unity of Divine knowledge of all things created, all created things are willed by Him. This unity of the Divine will in the act of creation is an act of Divine Goodness. It is a sharing of HIs goodness with the created order. This is a Trinitarian act because Christ is the Word of God through whom He speaks the world into existence and the Spirit is the love of the Divine Will by which He wills the world from His Goodness.

It became an idea adopted by most if not all classical theologians from Boethius to Aquinas.      For God, there is no real past, present, or future, to God all is Now. God can directly experience every part of that Big Now. Difficuly one is if there is no real past, there can be no before, now, afterwards. Creation entails before creation, creation, after creation. One might argue God is an immanent sustainer of this eternal creation.   But that entails all ever was and is and will be as it is eternally. Why then does a perfectly good God sustain horrendous evil and suffering?      And we are baack to the problem off long befoe these evils, God knew some 13.75 billion years ago these evils would happen. A trillion years ago, God knew this horrific evil in this Universe would exist. An googleplex years ago, God could experience this segment of the Big Now and witness this evil and suffering.      If we claim God created this world, God chose this Universe with all its evils and we get no free will. God gets the blame. If we argue God merely sustains this Universe, God gets the blames for all suffering and evil. If God from any point in eternity knew the state of what we percieve of Now, that is immutable and unchangable.

1870,"And by the way, I would offer the idea that this helps characterize true and real **development** of doctrine that is binding, and separate it from opposition and revolution or not-binding teaching: a true development, when FIRST proposed, is normally _by that very fact_ not proposed as binding. It is (normally) by dint of being then thoroughly fleshed out and worked out so that its compatibility with all the _other_ doctrines that it is not meant to unseat is clear. Even better, when the new development is expressed in a way that _manifestly_ connects to and coordinates with the pieces of the prior teachings that it IS meant to alter in some qualified way. It is true development when a Catholic who accepted the old way of saying the teaching can look at the new way and say of it: ""I see that this re-frames the old concepts in a way that introduces a new distinction never made before, and is not so much a _denial_ of the old teaching but a refinement of it."" When those who have been holding to the old teaching CANNOT say anything like that, indeed when the appearance (to them, in good faith) is that the new ""teaching"" really is just a flat out denial of the old, that's not _true development_ , and the **very lack of clarification given** should be taken as CONSTITUTING a criterion by which the Church saying that the Church is not (yet) insisting on the new ""teaching"" as binding.",way would offer idea help characterize true real development doctrine binding separate opposition revolution not-binding teaching true development first proposed normally fact proposed binding normally dint thoroughly fleshed worked compatibility doctrine meant unseat clear even better new development expressed way manifestly connects coordinate piece prior teaching meant alter qualified way true development catholic accepted old way saying teaching look new way say see re-frames old concept way introduces new distinction never made much denial old teaching refinement holding old teaching say anything like indeed appearance good faith new teaching really flat denial old true development lack clarification given taken constituting criterion church saying church yet insisting new teaching binding,feser,1401,0

2012," **But the same sorts of thing occur in reverse,** when you judge and evil man to be innocent: in respect of the **mere judgment itself** neither harm nor benefit befalls anyone else, including him. But as soon as you act on the judgment by according him trust as if he were innocent, when he is guilty, you harm _whatever project hinged_ on according him that trust. This usually means harm to yourself (because, usually, you will be a participant in that project), or it COULD be many other people besides yourself. You therefore are **JUST AS LIKELY** to harm yourself and others in this way as in the first case above. The two are entirely analogous.      To look at it from a non-personal perspective: in a court of criminal law, regarding penalties that the law might impose, the judge (or jury) applies a standard of ""innocent until proven guilty"" and a standard of needing guilt to be established ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". But in a civil suit, the judge applies a DIFFERENT STANDARD: the award of damages or benefits is based on a mere _preponderance of the evidence""_ , i.e. wherever the stronger argument lies, there is where the judgment lies. And the judge MUST render a judgment that will be to the detriment (i.e. ""harm"") one of the two parties. Therefore, he must harm one and benefit the other on the basis of merely _whichever is one more probably in the right (has the better argument)_ , he cannot choose to opt out of judging.      Here's the thing: The ""court of public opinion"" and personal judgments are similar to each other in this - that they are RIGHTLY not restricted to bringing conclusions only with evidence showing ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". They both RIGHTLY make judgments based (at least much closer to) on a mere _preponderance of the evidence_ , OR EVEN LESS! And this applies to the vast, vast array of social and civic decisions we must make: I choose not to enter into a repair contract with this roofing contractor because ""he felt slimy to me"", and nothing more specific than that, is a **perfectly appropriate** judgment to make. I don't even have to be judging him to be ""slimy"" as being ""more likely than not"" (i.e. above 50%), it would be sufficient for me to do it based on a lower scale, like 20% or 30% likelihood, because I can go find another contractor whom I estimate is far less likely to be slimy, perhaps ""less than 5%"". Thus I ""harm"" the first contractor based on a very modest basis of evidence, and do so with complete legitimacy.      You might recast this judgment as being not ""he IS slimy"" but rather ""there is a 30% probability he is slimy"", but that doesn't prevent (a) that you made a negative judgment and a negative CHOICE affecting him, and (b) your choice does him harm (in some sense). So recasting it that way still causes the judgment to fall under St. Thomas's stated opprobrium, even though it is manifestly a right kind of judging.      The only way to repair the argument Thomas gives is to reframe it as: it is wrong to make FIRMER judgments (against) someone than the evidence (you have) allows for. And the certain wrongness here lies **primarily in its defiance to the virtues of truth** , and not ""harm to the person.” The virtues of truth (e.g. prudence) would have you make DUE judgments that the evidence allows for, and WITHHOLD from firmer opinions than the evidence allows, and when you violate that, you _harm yourself_ first, before harming some other. Due judgments may well rely on less-than-solid evidence, if they are less-than- solid _judgments_ (i.e. when they are held as opinions). Withholding from making judgments on incomplete evidence is ALSO a failure of prudence, when a judgment is needed regardless of the state of the evidence. Commanders in battle must often make judgments of the enemies tactical object when the evidence is far from solid, they cannot just wait until they have proof or even something close to it.",sort thing occur reverse judge evil man innocent respect mere judgment neither harm benefit befalls anyone else including soon act judgment according trust innocent guilty harm whatever project hinged according trust usually mean harm usually participant project could many people besides therefore likely harm others way first case two entirely analogous look non-personal perspective court criminal law regarding penalty law might impose judge jury applies standard innocent proven guilty standard needing guilt established beyond reasonable doubt civil suit judge applies different standard award damage benefit based mere preponderance evidence ie wherever stronger argument lie judgment lie judge must render judgment detriment ie harm one two party therefore must harm one benefit basis merely whichever one probably right better argument choose opt judging thing court public opinion personal judgment similar - rightly restricted bringing conclusion evidence showing beyond reasonable doubt rightly make judgment based least much closer mere preponderance evidence even le applies vast vast array social civic decision must make choose enter repair contract roofing contractor felt slimy nothing specific perfectly appropriate judgment make even judging slimy likely ie would sufficient based lower scale like likelihood go find another contractor estimate far le likely slimy perhaps le thus harm first contractor based modest basis evidence complete legitimacy might recast judgment slimy rather probability slimy prevent made negative judgment negative choice affecting b choice harm sense recasting way still cause judgment fall st stated opprobrium even though manifestly right kind judging way repair argument thomas give reframe wrong make firmer judgment someone evidence allows certain wrongness lie primarily defiance virtue truth harm person ” virtue truth eg prudence would make due judgment evidence allows withhold firmer opinion evidence allows violate harm first harming due judgment may well rely less-than-solid evidence less-than- solid judgment ie held opinion withholding making judgment incomplete evidence also failure prudence judgment needed regardless state evidence commander battle must often make judgment enemy tactical object evidence far solid wait proof even something close,feser,3929,0

1205,"Why do I propose that Kant’s influence did even more to bolster modern atheism than Hume’s? Because Kant offered a _positive_ alternative to the traditional metaphysics that upheld theism, whereas Hume’s critique is essentially negative. To be sure, contemporary commentators are correct to hold that it is too simple to read Hume as a mere skeptic, full stop. True, he does try to undermine traditional metaphysical views about substance, causation, the self, moral value, etc. But he also emphasizes that the hold such notions have over common sense cannot be shaken by philosophical skepticism, since they are too deeply rooted in human psychology. And for purposes of “common life,” they are indispensable.

4144,"On a relevant but distinct sidenote, I have noticed that Thomists occasionally treat ID as a whipping boy without understanding it. I don't think that this has occurred here, but I have seen Thomists who act as though the the ID movement is a Protestant thing because it somehow involves the denial of secondary causality. If this were true, it is hard to explain why important Catholic philosophers like Ben Wiker or Catholic thinkers from CUA like Jay Richards would be involved with it. In fact, I know that this is not true because one of the very reasons that I converted from Protestantism to Catholicism in the wake of my graduate study at Wheaton was because I recognized the truth and profundity of secondary causality and how this accounted for the Catholic account of cooperation with grace. I seen nothing within ID that necessarily excludes this sort of causality even if it does not explicitly appeal to it. I have also seen a professed Thomist dialogue with Dr. Behe (a fellow Catholic and a biologist who wrote Darwin's Black Box) and even written about his work and it is obvious from the exchange that this person did not take the time to understand what Behe was saying.      This brings me back to my point above. I don't think it is fruitful to discourage the good that is done by ID (or is the suggestion that *no good* is done?) by criticizing it for not getting us all the way to Classical Theism or a link way the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. What it does do for many is get them away from a thorough going secular, materialist worldview. Dr. Behe has had many folks tell him that his work saved their faith in God. Now if scholastic demonstrations get them further, that need not cause us to criticize ID for also moving them away from materialism and atheism and toward theism. Although the critique in the post above is a critique of Meyer's work (or the suggestion made by the title of his work), I think the same principle is applicable.",relevant distinct sidenote noticed thomists occasionally treat id whipping boy without understanding think occurred seen thomists act though id movement protestant thing somehow involves denial secondary causality true hard explain important catholic philosopher like ben wiker catholic thinker cua like jay richards would involved fact know true one reason converted protestantism catholicism wake graduate study wheaton recognized truth profundity secondary causality accounted catholic account cooperation grace seen nothing within id necessarily excludes sort causality even explicitly appeal also seen professed thomist dialogue dr behe fellow catholic biologist wrote black box even written work obvious exchange person take time understand behe saying brings back point think fruitful discourage good done id suggestion good done criticizing getting u way classical theism link way god abraham isaac jacob many get away thorough going secular materialist worldview dr behe many folk tell work saved faith god scholastic demonstration get need cause u criticize id also moving away materialism atheism toward theism although critique post critique work suggestion made title work think principle applicable,feser,1972,0

2967,"Okay now to address your scenario. You are asking whether the scenario you describe is possible. Here we have to make a distinction between something being logically possible and something that is actually the case. The scenario you describe is logically possible in the same way that it is logically possible that God could have made unicorns. However, framing it this way and then going on to say that we should hope for this is analagous to suggesting that we should hope for the existence of unicorns.      The question is not whether it is logically possible in the strict sense. The question is: what from reason or revelation has led you to think that this is in fact the case? After we have all listened to the crickets for a bit, we should be able to move on from this question. Instead we have to put up with folks bending their will to find any figure within the tradition who will agree with their foregone conclusions.      Their approach is not: what is the weight of Tradition on this question. Their question is: can I find anyone who agrees with me. Their question is not: how do I operate within the stream of Tradition making sense of all of Scripture in light of Tradition and especially in light of the greatest figures in the Tradition (doctors like St. Thomas, St. Augustine, etc.). Rather their approach is: how close can I get to affirming something as close to universalism as possible without actually committing myself to propositions that have been explicitly condemned. This is *NOT* a catholic approach to theology.      The problem, however, is even greater than what I have described. It is not that they have neither reason nor revelation supporting their position and they choose to believe it anyways. That would be irrational. However something more is occurring. They actually have both Scripture affirming that few will find eternal life and the greatest doctors of the Church understanding that passage in its very obvious sense and they reject this testimony or explain it away. Again, that is *not* a Catholic approach to theology.      And contrary to the calumnious suggestions otherwise, the concern of those who are speaking out against these trends is ""pastoral"". Those speaking against these trends (e.g. Ralph Martin in his book Will Many Be Saved? and Edward Feser and Fr. Rooney and the Popes who have repeatedly warned about indifferentism) are motivated precisely out of love for those drawn into indifference over sin because of these dangerous opinions. Hard to get people to suffer the embarrassment of a good confession if they think that everyone is going to heaven regardless.

2903," _Even in ordinary language, the term 'proselytism' does have a vaguely negative connotation these days, so it is fair enough that the Church has chosen to deploy it to denote negative ways of promoting the faith, while giving this clarifying definition in the 2007 document.   _      Fair enough. While giving the clarification. But then again: _Not_ fair enough absent the needed clarification, and certainly not when the clarification is being more or less actively undermined by other ambiguity.      And for particulars: one specific example used, of preaching for the ""gospel of prosperity"", I would argue is **not** a sound example. The pope argues that their interpretation of the gospel is in error, and their manner of persuading is unjust. As to the latter - maybe so, although I would want to see specifics to see what, precisely, is unjust. As to their erroneous interpretation - that is so, but (in many cases, though admittedly not in all) the preachers are _sincere_ in their misguided grasp of the gospel. So their error on this is in no way more damaging to the mere fact of their trying to persuade others, than is that of mainline Protestant churches, who also are in error in their interpretation of the gospels. The pope's singling out the mainline Protestants as being ""OK"", and the gospel of prosperity preachers being mean nasty ""proselytizers"" is - on this score - not consistent.      The real problem with the BAD kind of proselytism is that it uses as persuasive forces things that _should not_ be used so. It may use false premises. Or false logic. Or appeal to emotional ""motives"" that are not founded on reasonable bases. Or unreasonable threats of bad outcomes ""if you don't convert"". But mainline Protestants have used these tools also: e.g. they have used false premises in falsely characterizing the _Catholic_ teachings from which they depart. (E.G. ""Catholics worship Mary"".)      These kinds of tools are wrongly used in _Catholic_ hands, too, so it's not the _true proposition_ on account of which they are employed that is the problem with them, it is the manner in which they act on the hearer to cause belief.      Like with all the other times Francis has played funny games with the truth: it's not that his words cannot be understood - with added clarifications - that makes them fit well with Catholic teaching overall. It's that he persistently chooses to present so many of them in obscuring, confusing, problematic ways, and he rarely bothers to clarify later himself, leaving it to other organs of the Vatican to suggest clarifications, while he goes on blythely generating more confusing commentary. The issue with ""God intends a plurality of religions"" stuff is a perfect example: he went beyond appropriate bounds in a public document, his curia ""corrected"" the sense of the passage so as to mitigate the problem, and then later he again in signing yet another public document with the same sort of obscurantist language.      Francis has publicly ""justified"" his so-called ""carelessness"" in these confusing sayings / teachings, by _saying_ that he is careless. But from the fact that the errors and obscurantism all plays to one angle, it isn't truly an accidental kind of carelessness. And anyway, if a person knows he is careless in off-the-cuff remarks, (a) that does not excuse him from _not refraining_ from making such remarks where he could sow problems, and (b) it does not excuse him with respect to written documents published after (what should be) careful consideration.

1750," _in the misbegotten attempt of thinking that such a strategy will drag Catholic thought into the mainstream from the periphery,_      That's just plain goofy, stupid nonsense.

3210,"@Laudator Temporis Acti      There is nothing about your objection that logically limits its application to matters of religion - if it were valid, it would remove the possibility of objective certainty in any field of knowledge, since any assertion we made would always require the implicit qualification, 'But since I am fallible, I could be wrong about this' (even about e.g. 2+2=4).      I'll mention in passing - the objection, thus taken to its logical conclusion, would therefore appear to be self-refuting, because the objector puts forward the objection itself as objectively certain truth (not qualifying it as 'merely probable').      But be that as it may, I will try to show that (whether or not its conclusion is self-refuting) the objection is a logical fallacy.      This is its basic structure:      It is possible for beliefs of mine to be false.   X is a belief of mine.   Therefore it is possible that X is false.      Consider the parallel argument:      It is possible for cats to be black.   Fluffy is a cat.   Therefore it is possible that Fluffy is black [even though I can see she is white].      The reason that these arguments fail is that I can be aware of more about Fluffy than the fact that she is a cat, and I can be aware of more about 'X' than the fact that it is a belief of mine. If all we knew about Fluffy was that she was a cat, then it would be reasonable to say that it was possible that she was black. And if all we knew about X was that it was a belief of my fallible self, then it would be reasonable to say that X was possibly false.      But in fact, I can know from the evidence of my senses that in Fluffy's case, the abstract possibility for cats to be black is not fulfilled in her particular case. And I can know from direct knowledge of conclusive logical or factual evidence in the particular case of X (e.g. 2+2=4), that the abstract general possibility of my beliefs being false is not fulfilled in the particular case of my belief X.      This is why the general fallibility that is ours as humans does not prove the impossibility of individuals reaching valid objective certainty in particular cases, where the individual is aware of sufficient evidence for the belief.      So there is no reason in principle why an individual, although fallible, might not discover sufficient evidence to ground a valid objective certainty (absolute certainty or reasonable moral certainty as the case may be) that e.g. '2+2=4', or 'The theory of relativity is true', or 'God has promised to protect from error a whole class of statements made by the pope in certain fairly well-defined circumstances'.

3683,"@ StardustyPsyche,      ""You may observe that an object comes to a rest, but what you are failing to realize is that other objects increase in their velocity by an amount equal to the observed loss.""      Actually, the Newtonian formulation is _not_ that velocity is conserved. It is that _momentum_ is conserved, _if_ it is measured in _inertial_ coordinates. Furthermore, Newton could not define inertial coordinates, as he well knew. Rest, with respect to the stars, which are in accelerated motion, doesn't work. Still, you ought to get straight the difference between momentum and velocity before you ""explain"" your prejudice to me.      ""No, all motion is in space. You are in space. The medium does not impede motion, rather, neighbors within the medium impede motion of one object by gaining motion for themselves. No net motion is lost""      This is just garbage. If two blobs of putty collide and stick, motion is lost in any inertial reference frame.      ""According to special relativity the mass of an object increases as the speed of the accelerated object approaches c. Energy is not lost, it is gained by the object being accelerated , or gained by any other object the accelerated object loses energy to. E=mc^2 is an expression of the conservation of material.""      You cut off my argument, and substituted something irrelevant to what I said, I guess because you didn't understand it although I put it in pretty simple terms. If an object moves from one place to another with 0 time elapsed on its clock, it is moving at infinite speed. If it changes in a short distance it can't be moving at infinite speed. Populations of neutrinos, which interact so minutely with matter that they can travel tens of thousands of light years through lead without interacting were found to be changing between types in a distance as short as the Earth's diameter. This meant that they had rest mass, and that meant that they couldn't be ""seeing"" time intervals of 0 in their forward direction because if they could they would have to have infinite energy according to special relativity (don't interrupt me again). However, if a constant force were applied in the same direction, its velocity would indeed approach infinity because it would see the time interval over long distances approaching 0 and it would be 0 in the infinite limit. Another way of seeing this is that the space interval in the direction of motion would approach 0 for the forever accelerated object and this would make the distance crossed 0 and it would ""cross the universe"" in 0 time, although unaccelerated observers would see it as a great distance crossed in great time.      So if Aristotle was worried that a mover operating forever would make the speed infinite, he was right even though his concept of motion did not come from modern science but from a different direction that did not contradict science at all.      Since you confuse velocity, momentum, energy, relative motion and absolute motion and change over time with change in the present, and the very meaning of change, I don't think you are doing anything but bootstrapping radical prejudice which blinds you from seeing that your assumptions grossly mislead you and anyone else who takes you seriously.      Also, I doubt that Professor Feser is anywhere as close in agreement with you as you seem to think.

To argue about God’s choices is therefore meaningless unless he revealed something about it.

That is an astounding thing, a top down view of the telos of the universe.

2726,"Regarding the council of Orange and semi-pelagianism: Here again, this assertion reflects a high level of confidence and a high level of ignorance mixed in a toxic cocktail. Pelagianism is a heresy. And Church councils condemn heresy, rather than upholding a moderated version of heresy (i.e. semi-heresy).Semi-pelagianism, which is imprecise and often undefined, denies the role of God's grace in the initial movement of the will toward God. This is denied by both the Council of Orange and St. Augustine. In fact it is condemned by the Council of Orange as heresy. So, the council of Orange *nowhere* condemned St. Augustine. It did however condemn a version of the very same heresy that St. Augustine fought so tirelessly against.      Now, the key here for anyone who cares about orthodoxy is that heresy and orthodoxy are not defined by the self-appointed pope WCB. It is defined by the Church that the Scripture's refer to as ""the pillar and foundation of truth"" and which Christ said ""the gates of hell will not prevail against it"". Satan is the father of lies and where lies prevail (e.g. in the thought of WCB), there Satan prevails. This has not and cannot happen in Christ's Church which is the pillar and foundation of truth. So, as I mentioned below, WCB, no one here is interested in joining the cult of WCB. Your judgements are pervasively erroneous and you should consider tempering that unflinching confidence in your own wisdom. Trusting that rickety old bridge is going to lead you to fall into a pit.      As a final note to the interested reader, it is not enough to read Scripture and quote it. We have to interpret it correctly and there is such a thing as a heretical interpretation (for examples of this, review the writings of WCB). Pelagius was, after all, not reading the funny papers when he arrived at his position that ""there was when the word was not"". He was reading the book of Proverbs and offering a heretical interpretation of this book (He also wrote a commentary on Romans.). So, it is not enough to quote Scripture. Satan quoted Scripture. You have to interpret it truly with the pillar and foundation of truth and this involves submitting to the judgements of Church councils which are under the guidance of the Holy Spirit as we see in Acts 15 from St. James' words (""it seemed good to us and to the Holy Spirit"") as the council sent out letters to the Churches notifying all Christians of the decision of the council. They did not say, ""well take a bible--if your literate--and decide what you think on this issue and, if you are not literate, just follow whoever is most able to convince you with ""smooth and flattering words that will ""tickle your ears"" (two quotes from Scripture, I will leave to the reader to look them up). Instead, everyone knew that they must obey the judgement of the leaders of the Church at the Jerusalem council. After all, Hebrews teaches, ""Obey your leaders"". It is for this reason that they did not say, ""Let me see what you think about that and then I will decide whether or not you got it right."" That would be the arrogant and foolish approach of WCB. Instead, they received the letter with joy and docility because they understood the teaching of Scripture: ""Obey your leaders.""",regarding council orange semi-pelagianism assertion reflects high level confidence high level ignorance mixed toxic cocktail pelagianism heresy church council condemn heresy rather upholding moderated version heresy ie semi-heresysemi-pelagianism imprecise often undefined denies role grace initial movement toward god denied council orange st augustine fact condemned council orange heresy council orange nowhere condemned st augustine however condemn version heresy st augustine fought tirelessly key anyone care orthodoxy heresy orthodoxy defined self-appointed pope wcb defined church refer pillar foundation truth christ said gate hell prevail satan father lie lie prevail eg thought wcb satan prevails happen church pillar foundation truth mentioned wcb one interested joining cult wcb judgement pervasively erroneous consider tempering unflinching confidence wisdom trusting rickety old bridge going lead fall pit final note interested reader enough read scripture quote interpret correctly thing heretical interpretation example review writing wcb pelagius reading funny paper arrived position word reading book proverb offering heretical interpretation book also wrote commentary roman enough quote scripture satan quoted scripture interpret truly pillar foundation truth involves submitting judgement church council guidance holy spirit see act st word seemed good u holy spirit council sent letter church notifying christian decision council say well take bible -- literate -- decide think issue literate follow whoever able convince smooth flattering word tickle ear two quote scripture leave reader look instead everyone knew must obey judgement leader church jerusalem council hebrew teach obey leader reason say let see think decide whether got right would arrogant foolish approach wcb instead received letter joy docility understood teaching scripture obey leader,feser,3256,0

2011,"@Infinite Growth (continued)      The area that we have to be most careful in is in judging particular intentions associated with a particular act. It is here that judgements are most unsure. Now, we also have to be careful not to completely de-link intentions from the exterior act. (This is a problem that occurred in 20th century Catholic theology. On this point, see Matthew Levering's recent book The Abuse of Conscience). The act is intended by the person and if the act is bad then the intention is bad in some way. However, the person again may be acting from ignorance or confusion or trying to achieve some real good and yet be going about it in the wrong way. In this instance, you can again explain moral principles and why a particular act is not good and this should help to guide their intentions in the future as they realize, for example, that a good end does not justify a bad means. etc.      However some people are in fact habitually bad. That is, they have bad character. In this instance another work of mercy is called for: Rebuking the sinner.      Regarding your suggestion that our only enemy is the principalities, this also is based on a partial reading of St. Paul. St. Paul also identifies the flesh as our enemy in Galatians 5:19ff, ""Now the deeds of the flesh (Greek: sarx) are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, etc..."" He warns that those who practice these things will not inherit the kingdom of God. Flesh is used in multiple and analogous ways in the NT and can be used to simply refer to the body, but here it refers to sinful desires, intentions and acts. So the flesh, in this sense, is also an enemy of the Christian according to Paul.      If we take a broader focus on the New Testament, we also find that ""the world"" (Greek: kosmos) is also an enemy of the Christian and this is reflected in the writings of St. John. Kosmos is also used in multiple senses in the NT so this does not entail that each use refers to something bad. However, a worldly spirit that says ""Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die"" (i.e. ""this world is all there is""; hence worldliness) is contrary to authentic faith and is another enemy of the Christian.      It is for this reason that the council of Trent identified three enemies of the Catholic viator: Satan, the world, and the flesh. So, the suggestion that we have only one enemy is based on a partial consideration of the New Testament at the exclusion of other parts.",infinite growth continued area careful judging particular intention associated particular act judgement unsure also careful completely de-link intention exterior act problem occurred th century catholic theology point see matthew recent book abuse conscience act intended person act bad intention bad way however person may acting ignorance confusion trying achieve real good yet going wrong way instance explain moral principle particular act good help guide intention future realize example good end justify bad mean etc however people fact habitually bad bad character instance another work mercy called rebuking sinner regarding suggestion enemy principality also based partial reading st paul st paul also identifies flesh enemy galatian ff deed flesh greek sarx evident immorality impurity sensuality idolatry sorcery enmity strife jealousy etc warns practice thing inherit kingdom god flesh used multiple analogous way nt used simply refer body refers sinful desire intention act flesh sense also enemy christian according paul take broader focus new testament also find world greek kosmos also enemy christian reflected writing st john kosmos also used multiple sens nt entail use refers something bad however worldly spirit say eat drink merry tomorrow die ie world hence worldliness contrary authentic faith another enemy christian reason council trent identified three enemy catholic viator satan world flesh suggestion one enemy based partial consideration new testament exclusion part,feser,2520,0

1256," _In the American context, how about totally free education (books, tuition, room and board, everything) at every level for historically oppressed minorities, paid for by the super-rich, and continued until such time as the wealth gap between whites and minorities was erased._      Amazing how so many plans to erase a racial divide (which must always be illicit and evil, not at all natural) inevitably turns into a not-so-subtle payday for people. There's a reason why ""free"" room and board, tuition, and education is paired with the requirement that it be ""paid for"" by someone else: because it's not free. And it's not going to be the super-rich paying either.      If the concern is to provide education as cheaply and freely as possible, maybe we should consider price caps on tuition. The fact is, with the modern internet, we are capable of providing a massive amount of education for dirt cheap compared to what traditional, outdated institutions currently offer. In fact, we already do so: see Coursera, or all kinds of other online options.      But this solution, while clearly viable and even superior to the traditional alternative, would not enrich the bloated, inefficient education system. And, for all the cries of racism and inequality, circumventing that kind of payout is not a price the loudest antiracists are willing to pay.

1896,"Hi Tom      The sentence in which I used novelty merely emphasized the point of these posts namely to demonstrate that it is possible for a pope to commit heresy and it has happened before.      Here's what I said      ""hence the urgency to show that it is possible for a Pope to commit heresy so that it isn't seen as some kind of novelty""      In this very post he mentions      ""The lessons of the case of Honorius are clear. When a pope is not speaking ex cathedra, it is possible for him to fall into error. ""      To quote Prof. Feser from twitter while he was replying to someone who questioned that the arguments in this post are also used by heretical catholics (sedes, liberals) to habitually disagree with Papal statements      ""But there are also people whose faith is shaken because they think they're expected to swallow that which contradicts past doctrine. There's a danger in not addressing that worry by keeping silent about the possibility of legitimate disagreement merely because some abuse it.""      It doesn't seem that I said anything different, danger implies urgency.      As for what you mentioned about the abuse scandals, personally, I feel it's a bit uncharitable to lay all of the blame at the feet of Pope Francis, 99% of the all the abuse took place preceding this papacy and were just revealed during this papacy, obviously there have been some hush ups which should be criticised but those same kind of cover ups took place on a very large scale during Pope St JPII's papacy, And even Pope Benedict was aware of Mccarrick and had already imposed some sanctions. How Prelates may choose to respond to some scandal is a matter of Prudence, prudence maybe wrong at times. There has also been large scale reform though in regards to the issue though, such as making the reporting process easier, efforts to make the process more transparent, candidates to priesthood are also scrutinized to a very high degree, so there has been some positive change.      As for heresy with regards to sexual morality being perpetuated at the highest level, with regards to same sex marriage and blessings of such couples and the like, the document by the CDCF which was put out awhile ago was quite firm, Pope Francis approved it. Is it not better to go by an official statement then by unconfirmed reports of someone reporting what the Pope allegedly told them.      With regards to Amoris Latetia, Orthodox Theologians like Mathew Levering have shown that the texts in doubt can be given an orthodox interpretation. Obviously it would be better if Pope Francis answered the Dubium himself and we could criticise him for that. But that doesn't entail that this issue is such that people have cause to question their faith especially when orthodox   Interpretations have been offered. In the absence of clarification, one ought to charitably go with the orthodox interpretation while respectfully awaiting a reply. If you are someone with a high position in Rome you could even respectfully use your influence to perhaps prompt some response.         As for ""leaving heterodox opinion at the highest levels standing without clear or any correction"", It can even be argued that Pope John Paul II did the same with Walter Kasper by promoting him who evidently has a heretical postion on the very issue of divorce. Pope Benedict XVI while obviously and sternly disagreeing with him on this issue, did appraisingly mention Kasper's book on Christ in the intro to his final books on the new testament and Christ.      Also if I feel that something should be expressed in a particular way, why can't I suggest it, whether it's taken or not is irrelevant and doesn't change my admiration and respect for Prof.      Elon Musk goes after who he wants without fear lol, did you forget that guy who helped save those kids from the cage.

4047," _You say that, if there is disagreement among the bishops, the only practical infallible organ [on that disputed point] is a General Council confirmed by the Pope or an ex cathedra statement._      Agreed. This does not prevent there to be a dispute about something that had already been taught infallibly earlier. Indeed, Councils have often needed to repeat and re-state the very same dogmatic teaching that a previous Council had made a definitive, infallible teaching: because people continued to dispute with the earlier teaching. In such a situation, _ordinary_ teaching by bishops won't ""settle"" the issue. You need extraordinary teaching authority, and you may need several rounds of it EVEN THOUGH each round is capable of infallibility all on its own. De facto and de jure are distinct: ""has been accepted"" is not the same as ""SHOULD have been accepted"".      _However, as I mentioned, such declarations do not merely amount to infallible statements concerning the history of the ordinary magisterium of the bishops._      Agreed. Before the aftermath of Ordinatio Sacerdotalis, (so far as I know) the organs of the Church never attempted to **officially** declare that that ""this dogmatic truth has been taught infallibly by the ordinary magisterium of the bishops throughout the world"". And in fact, it would be a _particularly bad idea_ for a pope to attempt an _Ex Cathedra_ declaration that ""this truth had been taught infallibly through the ordinary magisterium"", not least because post-Apostolic HISTORICAL truth is not a normal object of divine revelation about which the Church exercises infallible teaching. No: ex cathedra teachings do not have the _history_ of the teaching as their formal object, they have the truth of the faith as their formal object. I have made this point extensively in my own blogging.      I have also made the express point that Pope JPII could not set the matter of women's ordination beyond doubt (which was his express purpose) WITHOUT giving the teaching as an ex cathedra statement. So, in light of the fact that he used ALL the necessary forms of giving an ex cathedra declaration in Ordinatio Sacerdotalis, the fact that _later on_ the CDF asserted that the teaching _had already been taught infallibly_ DID NOT refute the fact that Ordinatio Sacerdotalis **also** taught infallibly that the Church cannot ordain women as priests.      My _underlying_ point remains standing: when a pope simply repeats a teaching that has ALREADY been infallibly taught by the Church, this is just an ordinary kind of ordinary magisterial act, and this is _of the same nature_ as other bishops also repeating that same teaching, who themselves also carry out ordinary magisterial acts of the teaching Church. His teaching act is an ordinary act of the magisterial office of the Church.",say disagreement among bishop practical infallible organ disputed point general council confirmed pope ex cathedra statement agreed prevent dispute something already taught infallibly earlier indeed council often needed repeat re-state dogmatic teaching previous council made definitive infallible teaching people continued dispute earlier teaching situation ordinary teaching bishop settle issue need extraordinary teaching authority may need several round even though round capable infallibility de facto de jure distinct accepted accepted however mentioned declaration merely amount infallible statement concerning history ordinary magisterium bishop agreed aftermath ordinatio sacerdotalis far know organ church never attempted officially declare dogmatic truth taught infallibly ordinary magisterium bishop throughout world fact would particularly bad idea pope attempt ex cathedra declaration truth taught infallibly ordinary magisterium least post-apostolic historical truth normal object divine revelation church exercise infallible teaching ex cathedra teaching history teaching formal object truth faith formal object made point extensively blogging also made express point pope jpii could set matter ordination beyond doubt express purpose without giving teaching ex cathedra statement light fact used necessary form giving ex cathedra declaration ordinatio sacerdotalis fact later cdf asserted teaching already taught infallibly refute fact ordinatio sacerdotalis also taught infallibly church ordain woman priest underlying point remains standing pope simply repeat teaching already infallibly taught church ordinary kind ordinary magisterial act nature bishop also repeating teaching also carry ordinary magisterial act teaching church teaching act ordinary act magisterial office church,feser,2825,0

Where I said, ""No one has excuses for their sins, and yet everyone faces attacks caused by imperfect trust in God precisely because we are human, and that is why loving pastoral guidance is needed"", I wish to clarify that loss of trust (faith) is sin and it is the duty of the shepherd to guide the lost sheep back to safety with the flock.      Professor Feser wrote an extensive analysis of the parallel duty of the theologian where such pastoral care is insufficient, this parallel duty sometimes going so far as to criticize publicly. It is taken mostly from the work (Donum Veritatis) of Cardinal Ratzinger. Professor Feser quotes him extensively.

It offers support for that assertion from Eastern Fathers and saints, i.e. people that most Orthodox Christians consider to _matter_ in identifying orthodoxy.      _Hart obviously thinks its more important to be right than to be orthodox._      I dare say you may be right, this is exactly how he thinks of it. And that, ITSELF, constitutes a non-Christian way of thinking about it: due to Christ's promises of protection, a Christian ought to be _very_ worried when he discovers ""I think X"" but ""the orthodox view is not-X"", and ought to hold that finding the above implies that very likely that he was wrong to think X is true, because ""orthodoxy"" has protections in getting at truth that I don't have. Preferring ""what-I-think-is-truth that I arrived at against orthodoxy"" over ""what-orthodoxy-says-is-truth"" is not **merely** ""preferring truth over orthodoxy"". It constitutes also a position about ""my reliability in getting at truth"" compared to ""the Church's reliability in getting at truth"". DBH can hold his view of preferring truth to orthodoxy, and hold to NOT being bothered about such a condition, but then he ought to _accept_ the comment of others that this disqualifies him from being a Christian, instead of going off on multi-page diatribes against them (as he has against Feser on that).",said essay useless beneath dbh left beneath including beneath comment saying time youre stupid childish bullying even fancier language book issue permanent punishment hell dbh could example said thing like page - demolish argument x whatever article offer nothing new claim position amount heresy accusation ever got anyone well offer shouting heresy offer support assertion eastern father saint ie people orthodox christian consider matter identifying orthodoxy hart obviously think important right orthodox dare say may right exactly think constitutes non-christian way thinking due promise protection christian ought worried discovers think x orthodox view not-x ought hold finding implies likely wrong think x true orthodoxy protection getting truth preferring what-i-think-is-truth arrived orthodoxy what-orthodoxy-says-is-truth merely preferring truth orthodoxy constitutes also position reliability getting truth compared reliability getting truth dbh hold view preferring truth orthodoxy hold bothered condition ought accept comment others disqualifies christian instead going multi-page diatribe feser,feser,1947,0

2480,"I agree with Walter that the ""God is good only in an analogical sense, not a univocal one!"" is a horrible and useless defense. As he said, when there is an analogy there is something in common; in particular, in ""God is good"" there is an analogy of proper proportionality. It is not a metaphor. For the classical theist, God is the source of all actualities - and that includes virtues and moral agency -, and as the source of all perfection and pure act God must FORMALLY possess all pure perfections (that is, perfections that in themselves include no limitation), but in an eminent way. The formal possession of pure perfections by God is insisted upon by many thomists (e.g. Garrigou-Lagrange) and is compatible with analogy (again, it's an analogy of proper proportionality).      Therefore, one can only say that ""God is not a moral agent"" or ""God is not virtuous"" if one believes that moral agency and virtue are not pure perfections. But I think it's obvious that they are pure perfections; the fact that moral agency is found in us in a limited, creaturely manner doesn't make it any less of a perfection just like the fact that wisdom is found in us in a changing, limited, creaturely manner doesn't mean wisdom is not a perfection - and the theist certainly says God is wise in a literal way. God is therefore also properly said to be morally good - indeed, morally perfect - and this goodness cannot contradict what seems basic to us with regard to evil, moral value, etc. Just like we wouldn't say God is omniscient if he didn't literally know (e.g.) that we exist. This is also why I think the ""Brian Davies"" line of approaching the PoE is entirely useless. And it has nothing to do with classical theism per se, but rather with moral virtue being or not being a pure perfection. Needless to say, most people would agree that if God does not at all care to stop a child from being tortured, then God is seriously deficient (which should be impossible).      Walter,      That being said, I wonder how you can feel so confident about the presence of suffering on this earth being totally pointless, and that it would be better to have a world (e.g.) without any Fall at any point. Don't you think that lies beyond your cognitive capacities? At the very least, doesn't it give you pause? It is very clear to me that, for instance, a world consisting of nothing but innocent people being tortured without end is a horrible world and God could not make it. But while that is clear, it is not at all clear to me that it would be immoral to have a world in which people suffered for some finite time on earth, and then went on to enjoy a much longer happy afterlife. And it is far from clear to me that the finite sufferings experienced in that world could not end up contributing to making the good end-state better, or just allowing for a good amount of soul-building, etc. I think you should give more credit to skeptical theism.      Don't get me wrong, I do see the strength in the problem of evil. But it seems to me that you are a bit too confident in the idea that there could be no morally sufficient reasons for God to create a world like ours; especially given that we might only know such a small part of life and the world (it could be like judging a whole novel on the basis of the first pages).",agree walter god good analogical sense univocal one horrible useless defense said analogy something common particular god good analogy proper proportionality metaphor classical theist god source actuality - includes virtue moral agency - source perfection pure act god must formally posse pure perfection perfection include limitation eminent way formal possession pure perfection god insisted upon many thomists eg garrigou-lagrange compatible analogy analogy proper proportionality therefore one say god moral agent god virtuous one belief moral agency virtue pure perfection think obvious pure perfection fact moral agency found u limited creaturely manner make le perfection like fact wisdom found u changing limited creaturely manner mean wisdom perfection - theist certainly say god wise literal way god therefore also properly said morally good - indeed morally perfect - goodness contradict seems basic u regard evil moral value etc like say god omniscient literally know eg exist also think brian davy line approaching poe entirely useless nothing classical theism per se rather moral virtue pure perfection needle say people would agree god care stop child tortured god seriously deficient impossible walter said wonder feel confident presence suffering earth totally pointless would better world eg without fall point think lie beyond cognitive capacity least give pause clear instance world consisting nothing innocent people tortured without end horrible world god could make clear clear would immoral world people suffered finite time earth went enjoy much longer happy afterlife far clear finite suffering experienced world could end contributing making good end-state better allowing good amount soul-building etc think give credit skeptical theism get wrong see strength problem evil seems bit confident idea could morally sufficient reason god create world like especially given might know small part life world could like judging whole novel basis first page,feser,3317,0
1970,"The article is informative and all but I do have some problems with the overall harsh tone of the article especially the ending where in it seems like some of kind of coping mechanism, which more or less translates to ""The going is tough boys, but here is something you can look forward to that will strengthen your faith, the punishment and harsh judgement of those sinners (Followed by Loud Cheers).""      Why can't we just take a more positive route and pray for the conversion and change of those who we don't think are on the right path, why must we depend on looking forward to some fantasized harsh judgement and punishment of those who have lost their way so that our faith is not shaken.      To quote Pope Benedict XVI from God is With Us from the chapter God’s Yes and His Love Are Maintained Even in Death      ""The very heart of the faith has been lost to anyone who supposes that it is only worthwhile, if it is, so to say, made worthwhile by the damnation of others. Such a way of thinking, which finds the punishment of other people necessary, springs from not having inwardly accepted the faith; from loving only oneself and not God the Creator, to whom his creatures belong. That way of thinking would be like the attitude of those people who could not bear the workers who came last being paid a denarius like the rest; like the attitude of people who feel properly rewarded only if others have received less. This would be the attitude of the son who stayed at home, who could not bear the reconciling kindness of his father. It would be a hardening of our hearts, in which it would become clear that we were only looking out for ourselves and not looking for God; in which it would be clear that we did not love our faith, but merely bore it like a burden.""      End quote      To forestall some usual tired objections, obviously this doesn't deny the reality of hell or the reality that some human beings will go to hell or the reality of punishment. These Truths are obvious from Christ's clear words where he says ""Many will not be Able"". (Although on the question of relative numbers and percentages, I am inclined to agree with Cardinal Avery Dulles where he mentioned that God hasn't provided any such stats or figures like more then 50% etc. Those who interpret the narrow path and wide path in that way are free to do so but other interpretations such as taking it to be a practical warning and not as a prediction are legitimate opinions, The pratical warning interpretation is taken by Pope Benedict XVI in ""God and The World "" under the question ""Two Roads"". As in the Book of Revelations, John mentioned he saw an innumerable crowd of people.)         The main point I am trying to make here is that, looking forward to people's punishments isn't healthy and shouldn't be encouraged.

3239,"Implying that a Pope can teach heresy when not speaking ex cathedra - simply because Vatican I defined that ex cathedra statements cannot be heretical - seems a classic logical flaw of making the conclusion broader than the premises.      The Seventh Oecumenical Council could not evaluate the writings of Pope Honorius as heretical, not only because they weren’t, but because there was no discussion of these writings. If it accepted the history that Honorius was a heretic, it got it wrong.      Vatican I, which left nothing to implication, explained how we ought to interpret its deliberations. Because it defined that all the Popes had “unfailing faith”, the expressions contained in the deliberations of the Seventh Oecumenical Council should be understood as the censure of the extremely negligent behaviour that it was; the term heretic was not as specific then as it later would be. The sense of Vatican I in defining Papal infallibility is obvious; it is prefaced with Christ’s prayer that Peter’s faith would not fail, not merely that he might speak infallibly one a century. Rather than put a strict modern theological understanding of the term heresy into the mouths of prelates in ancient times, we need to apply the modern Church understanding of the Papacy; there is no getting around this.      Whether or not one can be accused of being a heretic for “not resisting an error” and “not defending the truth, one is NOT a heretic because of those things; Pope Felix III, cited in the post, has just explained how to view quite possible uses (which do not convey the understanding of a heretical Pope as we discuss it) of the term heretic in his times!

1947,"Well done. You, and I believe someone else, touch on another point I wanted to make but already had a four part reply. :) As you say, there had not yet at the time of Honorious been a formal declaration against monotheletism, so one could not be accused of knowingly opposing a formally established doctrine of the faith. At most, one could say he erred in failing to make an allegedly obvious deduction from Chalcedon (all arguable), but that it seems to me would still just rise to the level of material heresy, because presumably the failure to make such a deduction would not in itself evidence obstinancy in error. And, to be a formal error, there would have to be, I think, a formal declaration of what is to be believed. So I think we are back to (among other things) the question of whether it even makes sense to accuse a deceased person of formal heresy (which Feser has not done I realize), unless perhaps we can explicitly find a place where this person acknowledged he knew his view was heretical and did not care, etc.      It is also fair to say, I think, that these current insights would prevent such declarations against Honorius today. And we might have raise, as i have previously, where future popes could amend the non doctrinal juridical condemnations of earlier councils, but I would have to know more about the status of such statement relative to the establishment of tradition to venture a confident answer on that point. But I am inclined, very tentatively, to say since judgments are not infallible (even if they are at least authoritative AT THE TIME they are given) that they could be corrected later--though of course those corrections themselves could also be the same measure also be reviewed later, and so on. I suspect we could find concrete cases in Church history, but I'd have to look for details.",well done believe someone else touch another point wanted make already four part reply say yet time honorious formal declaration monotheletism one could accused knowingly opposing formally established doctrine faith one could say erred failing make allegedly obvious deduction chalcedon arguable seems would still rise level material heresy presumably failure make deduction would evidence obstinancy error formal error would think formal declaration believed think back among thing question whether even make sense accuse deceased person formal heresy feser done realize unless perhaps explicitly find place person acknowledged knew view heretical care etc also fair say think current insight would prevent declaration honorius today might raise previously future pope could amend non doctrinal juridical condemnation earlier council would know status statement relative establishment tradition venture confident answer point inclined tentatively say since judgment infallible even least authoritative time given could corrected later -- though course correction could also measure also reviewed later suspect could find concrete case church history look detail,feser,1836,0

4241,"Tadeo,   I myself struggled with that question for quite some time. For a while I held that God couldn't know the future because the future is not, and the act of knowing necessarily requires that which is, but fortunately some friends talked me out of that one. To my understanding, the answer (insofar as we can get to it) involves distinguishing between absolute necessity (i.e. it follows from the nature of the thing) and conditional necessity (which is brought about by a specific set of circumstances) and having a proper understanding of God's eternal knowledge (not foreknowledge) as a presentialist view, wherein God sees all things which are (for us) past, present, and future all as the present and immediately available. This knowledge of what presently is does not necessarily preclude the rational agent from choosing to do otherwise in that moment other than what he or she was already doing, i.e. it is conditionally necessary and not absolutely necessary.

4127,"In Dr. Feser's twitter account there was a response to the original tweets that I think captures what seems to me a very obvious problem with this criticism of Meyer. Jonathan wrote: ""I don’t think the point of these arguments is to make God contingent, but to argue for his existence probabilistically. I don’t see an issue with arguing for a metaphysically necessary being with abduction."" To object to this is to say that a contingent argument necessarily entails that the being argued for is contingent. That seems to me quite obviously false. It is the argument that is being characterized as contingent and this does not tell us that the being argued for is either contingent or necessary.      Dr. Feser responded to this tweet saying: ""I know they don't intend to make God contingent. But if an argument leaves it even possible that the world might exist apart from X, then to establish X isn't to establish God (Note that that doesn't entail that X is not God, but only that the arg doesn't establish that X is God)"" My response to this is that their aim is not to ""establish"" God (i.e. the God of Classical Theism who is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob). ID folks are very explicit about this. Their goal is not a scholastic demonstration. After all their arguments are contingent and proceed by way of abduction following the work of Pierce. That this approach does not get us all the way to classical theism and the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob seems to me no grounds for criticizing it as though it accomplishes nothing.      This appears to me like an older brother who is an exceptional and developed artist criticizing his younger brother for making initial efforts at art because those efforts are not as precise and clear. What would be the point of such an attack? It would certainly seem to me unnecessarily discouraging to the younger brother especially when the two approaches are not mutually exclusive.      The point I am making is consistent with Wuellner's definition: ""a conditional or provisional explanation of observed facts or of their connection with each other"". This can be taken in two ways. It can either entail that the existence of the thing that explains the phenomena is contingent and that its relationship to the thing caused is contingent *OR* it could mean that the explanation qua explanation is contingent (i.e. a contingent argument). Is it not entirely consistent with classical theism to recognize the latter possibility with abduction? It is not obvious to me why not.      It seems that Dr. Feser's answer to this is that an abductive approach can only show causal links that are themselves contingent (""because the causal relationship between them, even if real, is going to be contingent."") It is not clear to me why Dr. Feser thinks it is the case that contingent arguments entail that the being argued for is itself contingent and this seems to me to get at the crux of the issue.",dr twitter account response original tweet think capture seems obvious problem criticism meyer jonathan wrote think point argument make god contingent argue existence probabilistically see issue arguing metaphysically necessary abduction object say contingent argument necessarily entail argued contingent seems quite obviously false argument characterized contingent tell u argued either contingent necessary dr feser responded tweet saying know intend make god contingent argument leaf even possible world might exist apart x establish x establish god note entail x god arg establish x god response aim establish god ie god classical theism god abraham isaac jacob id folk explicit goal scholastic demonstration argument contingent proceed way abduction following work pierce approach get u way classical theism god abraham isaac jacob seems ground criticizing though accomplishes nothing appears like older brother exceptional developed artist criticizing younger brother making initial effort art effort precise clear would point attack would certainly seem unnecessarily discouraging younger brother especially two approach mutually exclusive point making consistent definition conditional provisional explanation observed fact connection taken two way either entail existence thing explains phenomenon contingent relationship thing caused contingent could mean explanation qua explanation contingent ie contingent argument entirely consistent classical theism recognize latter possibility abduction obvious seems dr answer abductive approach show causal link contingent causal relationship even real going contingent clear dr feser think case contingent argument entail argued contingent seems get crux issue,feser,2945,0

1942,"Tony, thank you for taking the time to read my posts. I am not clear on what issues you think I am fusing, but I THINK it is that i did not distinguish formal heresy from the ecclesiastical crime of heresy.      If I understand you correctly, I would say that my posts presume a case where a person does not consider his views to be heretical (as I would presume was the case with Honorius). I understand that a person could admit to knowing his view was heretical, and hold to it obstinately, and it be formal without ever being denounced by ecclesial authority.      So I accept that in principle the ecclesiastical crime of heresy and formal heresy are different. BUT, it seems to me that where a person does not take his view to be heretical, they basically conflate. The debate then would be whether a judgment by an authority is needed for us to discern whether or not they had sufficient basis to know the view was heretical. I THINK this might be where you and I disagree.      I would certainly acknowledge that one COULD be aware, in reality, that his view was heretical without such a judgment. But could anyone outside of the person himself sufficiently discern that? That is the question. My view would be that the only way we could know this definitively is if a judgment was made against the person, and he remained in his error.      And I think this then applies to the case of Honorius (BTW, elsewhere I noted Erick's point that there is the additional issue of no council having declared on monothelitism yet at the time of Honorius' letter, an additional wrinkle). I did state in places that I realize Feser was not addressing as such the distinction between formal and material heresy. I raise it to point out that in principle one could be anathematized on material heresy alone where that was not a clear understanding of this distinction, but such an anathema in retrospect is problematic. So that would prompt a further discussion as to given that the Church never later teaches anything not already implicitly supported by the defined deposit of faith, we must presume that those condemning Honorius would in fact be aware of something like material and formal heresy distinction, and still condemned him anyway.      My contention would be that we should not take their condemnation as proof that a pope could be guilty of teaching something sufficiently close to formal heresy, as I THINK you are suggesting. Rather, I would be inclined to do the reverse. Given that what the Church herself now implies (as I take it) about the relationship between formal heresy and the ecclesiastical crime of heresy (in cases where the person does not consider his view heretical), we can see that cases such as Honorius' prompted the need to develop the formal/material distinction more clearly. I think it is also fair to say that over time the Church has come to be procedurally more rigorous in understanding teachings to be DEFINITIVE only when formally pronounced in councils or ex catheda, even if we can contend that there can be infallible doctrine not so explicitly defined. But the ability to judge a person in relation to what they hold in such doctrines does in fact seem to differ when certain distinction and juridical procedures are more defined than they appear to have been in the time of Honorius' condemnation.",tony thank taking time read post clear issue think fusing think distinguish formal heresy ecclesiastical crime heresy understand correctly would say post presume case person consider view heretical would presume case honorius understand person could admit knowing view heretical hold obstinately formal without ever denounced ecclesial authority accept principle ecclesiastical crime heresy formal heresy different seems person take view heretical basically conflate debate would whether judgment authority needed u discern whether sufficient basis know view heretical think might disagree would certainly acknowledge one could aware reality view heretical without judgment could anyone outside person sufficiently discern question view would way could know definitively judgment made person remained error think applies case honorius btw elsewhere noted point additional issue council declared monothelitism yet time letter additional wrinkle state place realize feser addressing distinction formal material heresy raise point principle one could anathematized material heresy alone clear understanding distinction anathema retrospect problematic would prompt discussion given church never later teach anything already implicitly supported defined deposit faith must presume condemning honorius would fact aware something like material formal heresy distinction still condemned anyway contention would take condemnation proof pope could guilty teaching something sufficiently close formal heresy think suggesting rather would inclined reverse given church implies take relationship formal heresy ecclesiastical crime heresy case person consider view heretical see case prompted need develop formalmaterial distinction clearly think also fair say time church come procedurally rigorous understanding teaching definitive formally pronounced council ex catheda even contend infallible doctrine explicitly defined ability judge person relation hold doctrine fact seem differ certain distinction juridical procedure defined appear time condemnation,feser,3344,0
2821,"(continuation)      But the more I grew up, the more I saw how bullshit and make-believe that idea was. That's why I was very (and still am in some way) very afraid to believe or take something for granted. I don't want to believe in something because of how it tastes (i.e good or desirable), but because that's the truth. That's why I (wrongly as I can see now) take the road of ""naturalism"". Not only because of the overwhelming appeal that has today but because it was ""science"" and ""science is the truth"" and ""science is the only thing you can trust that is rational"" because ""it is founded on empirical data"" [I can go on ad nauseam but I will stop here]. But the problem is that at the time I didn't knew that ""science"" was so problematic and not that all-powerful being that is painted today, and full of theories and all that dogma behind it - I simply took it for granted like the average XXI century atheist.      But the problem with skepticism though is the fact that you never get anywhere with it - and in fact, it seems more reasonable to ""believe"" in absurdities that defy reality than something that sounds plausible or good at all. That's why I'm afraid of ""taking sides"". I must say the theory of act and potency, substantial form, the doctrine of the four causes is the most beautiful (and it sounds a lot saner than the rest of the competition out there) that I found since then.

But the problem with me, I'm afraid, is having the same 'faith' I had in the 'espirita' way (i.e the fact that being desirable and all of that) in the same sense with the A-T Meta. I know it sounds ridiculous to compare that crap doctrine of espiritismo with the A-T Meta (and I AM NOT DOING SO). What I am trying to say is that I am very afraid of *having faith* in something that it turns out to be false. I know I must sound like an idiot but I am opening my heart by saying that.

2117,"Also, naturalist's theory of ""spandrels"" is, again, a re-enactment of the **actualization of hidden potentialities existing in prime matter.** (an A-Thomistic metaphysical thesis).

So even if my winning has lower utility than your winning under similar circumstances, it does not follow that my trying to win has lower utility than my not trying to win. There are two possibilities, after all, assuming I try to win. Either I will succeed or I won't. If I won't succeed, then the harder I tried, the more enjoyable the victory for you, for your fans and for my fans. If I do succeed, the utility is lower than if I had tried and you nonetheless succeeded (I am assuming your victory has higher utility), but it may still be higher than had I failed to try (in which case very likely I would not have succeeded) because then there would have been general disappointment. So a case can be made that my trying to win is better than my not trying to win, even if other things being equal my winning is worse than your winning. And similar things seem to hold on expected utility versions.      Still, suppose that the utility of your winning is higher than of my winning, and I am about to win, but I have some subtle way of throwing the game so no one can tell, and everyone will enjoy the game pretty much as much. Then on externalist consequentialism I should throw the game in this way. Whether such a way of throwing the game is available depends on many factors: what the game is, who the audience are, what level one and one's opponent are.

4081,"WCB      As a matter of fact I also agree that foreknowledge is ultimately incompatible with free will, and I therefore reject foreknowledge, but I don't think your argument works.      I would respond by saying that you are confusing God's knowledge of an action with its causes. Proponents of foreknowledge would specify that God's knowing what you will freely do is precisely that: God's knowing what you will freely do. His knowledge doesn't cause your choice. Your choice comes first; God knows your choice because it's the choice you make. It's a contingent fact that is ultimately explained by you. God only knows it as a result of you making the choice.      I would also call attention to an important caveat: most proponents of foreknowledge do not actually accept that God ""ALWAYS"" knew everything that would happen, at least not without qualification. God's foreknowledge of creaturely acts is dependent on their existence, God first has to create them ""before"" he can have any knowledge about what they'll do. The one exception to this would be Molinists, who believe that God has ""middle knowledge"" and therefore knows not only future choices but also ""futuribles"" and counterfactuals of freedom. So ""before"" God created the universe that would have Hitler, he did not know (at least not for certain) what Hitler would do. And as soon as God created the universe that would have Hitler in it, it was already ""too late"" and God would know all that would happen (because it would happen).      God's foreknowledge of his own choices is more complicated to discuss. Since God is outside of time, he wouldn't really know ""in advance"" what he would do. There was no ""in advance"" before the creation of temporal things. So even defenders of foreknowledge would probably not accept that God ""foreknew"" what he would create. God just freely chose what to create, and with his choosing God knew what he was choosing, that was all.   As for God's foreknowledge of his ""future interferences"" in creation, one could respond either that it would be the same case as with creatures (God's choice has a priority over the foreknowledge and is not caused by it) or again God has no foreknowledge of himself because he is timeless even in his actions.",wcb matter fact also agree foreknowledge ultimately incompatible free therefore reject foreknowledge think argument work would respond saying confusing knowledge action cause proponent foreknowledge would specify knowing freely precisely knowing freely knowledge cause choice choice come first god know choice choice make contingent fact ultimately explained god know result making choice would also call attention important caveat proponent foreknowledge actually accept god always knew everything would happen least without qualification foreknowledge creaturely act dependent existence god first create knowledge one exception would molinists believe god middle knowledge therefore know future choice also futuribles counterfactuals freedom god created universe would hitler know least certain hitler would soon god created universe would hitler already late god would know would happen would happen foreknowledge choice complicated discus since god outside time really know advance would advance creation temporal thing even defender foreknowledge would probably accept god foreknew would create god freely chose create choosing god knew choosing foreknowledge future interference creation one could respond either would case creature god choice priority foreknowledge caused god foreknowledge timeless even action,feser,2247,0
108,"I'm not sure that the creaturely changes are necessarily ""destroying"" (or creating) parts of God (beliefs) on the open theists' assumption. I think they are determining them. I will assume open theists who believe God is maximally knowledgeable, that is, knows all that can be known, which does not include perfect knowledge of the future according to them.      On this set of assumptions God will still, however, have perfect foreknowledge of all possible outcomes as he can understand all possible cause/effect branches as First Cause. He just doesn't know which path along the branching options will eventuate before the time that they do. This means his knowledge grows only in the sense that he is able to pick out which of each fully foreseen branch is actualised. In other words, the only way his knowledge grows is by the steady lengthening of a ""track"" through a foreknown ""space"" of possible world-states over time. In such a scenario, creatures with free will would determine the direction of the track and thus the precise determination of God’s knowledge of it, but they would not be adding to or subtracting from God's beliefs in any quantitative sense.

396,"But I think in the finite case one can remove the counterintuitiveness. For there are mixed strategies that if adopted by everyone are better than everyone choosing _A_ or everyone choosing _B_. The mixed strategy will involve choosing some number 0 < _p_ best < _q_ (where _q_ is the threshold ratio at which the disaster happens) and everyone choosing _B_ with probability _p_ best and _A_ with probability 1 − _p_ best, where _p_ best is carefully optimized allow as many people to feed hungry children without a significant risk of disaster. The exact value of _p_ best will depend on the exact utilities involved, but will be close to _q_ if the number of agents is large, as long as the disaster doesn’t scale exponentially. Now our statistical reasoning shows that when your best estimate of the probability of other people choosing _B_ is _not_ close to the threshold ratio _q_ , you should just straight out choose _B_. And the worry I had is that everyone doing that results in the disaster. But it does not seem problematic that in a case where your data shows that people’s behavior is not close to optimal, i.e., their behavior propensities do not match _p_ best, you need to act in a way that doesn’t universalize very nicely. This is no more paradoxical than the fact that when there are criminals, we need to have a police force, even though ideally we wouldn’t have one.",think finite case one remove counterintuitiveness mixed strategy adopted everyone better everyone choosing everyone choosing b mixed strategy involve choosing number p best q q threshold ratio disaster happens everyone choosing b probability p best probability − p best p best carefully optimized allow many people feed hungry child without significant risk disaster exact value p best depend exact utility involved close q number agent large long disaster scale exponentially statistical reasoning show best estimate probability people choosing b close threshold ratio q straight choose b worry everyone result disaster seem problematic case data show behavior close optimal ie behavior propensity match p best need act way universalize nicely paradoxical fact criminal need police force even though ideally one,pruss,1387,1

Also for clarity's sake, I DO NOT believe that Hell is empty, and I do accept the weight of Tradition.      However, so far as I am aware (and this is of course limited - I have not read most of the Fathers & Doctors), there is no specific biblical passage that tells us in certain and definitive terms that THERE ARE some in Hell. It is, therefore, (so far as I know), remotely, vaguely possible to suggest that the biblical passages that point toward Hell are all to be understood as contingent: e.g. contingent on the sinner(s) not repenting.      _More than this, the scenario is *not possible* given the fact that Christ has revealed to us than many will in fact follow the path to destruction._      For all those huge numbers on the road to destruction, they will REACH destruction...if they do not repent. Suppose that **every single** person on Earth (other than Christ and Mary) will be on that road at some point in their lives, and so that road is very, very wide, and heavily populated. But we also know that SOME who are on that road turn around and head the other way - they repent.      Therefore, not everyone who is on the road to destruction _reaches_ destruction. What if 90% who are on the road right now, repent: the heavy population of the road right now tells us nothing about the ratio of those who end up in hell. What if it's 99%? What if it's 100% who repent?      Christ will, at the end of time, judge all people. Those who are judged to be goats will go off to final perdition. What if the class of ""the goats"" happens to have no members - an empty set? The _class_ is still a valid concept, because of the contingent possibility that some might not have repented.      I repeat: I don't think this what the weight of Tradition is pointing toward. I think that Christ **repeatedly** pointed out the dangers of Hell because there ARE people going to Hell.

Thus your real argument just seems to be a rejection of prime matter as being identified with passive potentiality.

Both of these arguments still go through on your account: there are first material causes (your 'ultimate physical forms') which remain the same in substantial change.

The effort would be better spent thinking about heaven.      Evil is not ""natural"" or part of the divine plan.

4272,"@ Walter Van den Acker,      ""Please continu""      Well then, the simplicity of a random number is greater than the simplicity of science, logic, or mathematics. The XOR process is meant to show that even a finite random sequence can mean any predetermined thing, but we cannot unravel its intended meaning, except by luck, and even then, there is no way to know that the lucky guess was correct, because it could mean anything that would fit against its length, as I wrote earlier.      The logic that you and I use, as expressed by Aristotle, is complex. The rules of inference are ordered and detailed in a complex way that cannot be reduced to the simplicity of a random number, which yet contains them if it is long enough, as I described. I earlier described how 2+2 could easily be made equal to 3 as shown by video games running a sequence that displays such things on a screen (ask me if this was somewhere else that I discussed it). With the infinite random sequence, an image (only) of God, these things are written an infinite number of times. Any finite part of it that is long enough, running on a computer, could always show our logic expressed as we know it. It could also always show the rules incorrectly expressed. That is because the predetermined meaning that could be anything intended, in the image, is not open to us and the XOR process shows that no specific random sequence matters. It's all in there somewhere and the computer can show anything you can imagine (now I will include moving images). It could show that the world runs exactly as our sight and sound senses tell us it runs except that if you walk 500 steps without stopping you step on the tines of a rake that suddenly appears and it pops up and gives you a good whack on the head and then disappears. Yet for some reason, people mentally (only) start to count their steps, they do not know why they are doing it, and they forget where they are in their count long before they reach 500. Then after 500 - whack!      Logic in this computable world would have to be different from the logic we love and know in order to account for these abnormal (in our world) mental phenomena. God knows this idea, but is not limited by it. If you don't like it, you can always ignore this computable meaning and only pay attention to the one you like. It's in there too but so are great numbers of other computable meanings.      Something that suggests this is the arrangement of the grains of sand on a beach washed by winds, waves, and disturbed by animals, including humans with their various activities, motorised or not, disturbed by their nuclear activity, etc. Now look at the arrangement of the grains as they change for a few days and then try to articulate something in the spirit of science as we know it that will allow you to accurately predict the arrangement of the grains into the future.

2875,"As Kurt suggests: it may indeed be possible to ""read"" Francis's words in a charitable light in which ""what he meant"" was to castigate the nasty proselytism that uses bad means (and motives) to push people into the Church, and not to throw stones at the kinder, gentler persuasion by which we justly bring others to appreciate the true Church of Christ. But at the same time, Francis used highly ambiguous phrasings to convey that, and - like he has ever so many other times - he INTENDS to be ambiguous, that's is precisely his operating method.      In this case, for example, there is, in addition to the negative-connotation word ""proselytism"" in the second sentence, the word ""convince"" in the first sentence. There is no reason, outside of Francis's choice to put them next to each other, to imagine that ""convincing someone of your faith"" amounts to ""proselytism"". Even if one might have (before this) thought he was **strictly** avoiding the impermissible ""proselytism"" types of action, and merely speaking so as to ""convince"" a listener of his faith, now he has to second-guess whether even that is allowable. And so, Francis chose to cloud up the matter.      It would be silly to look at all the hundreds (at this point) of occasions in which he has done this, and somehow imagine that they come out evenly divided between a traditional and a progressive view of Christianity. They do nothing of the sort: the confusion and obscurity sown is **very decidedly** in favor of one angle, and that's the progressive view. He's never accidentally confusing in a way that promotes traditional, standard Catholicism. So, it's not accidental at all, it's intentional.      (And by the way, in that video by Mike Lofton is FAR from being wholly exculpatory: take, for example, this quote from a 2007 doc. by BXVI's curia:      _The term proselytism originated in the context of Judaism, in which the term proselyte referred to someone who, coming from the gentiles, had passed into the Chosen People….More recently, however, the term has taken on a negative connotation, to mean the promotion of a religion by ujsing means, and for motives, contrary to the spirit of the Gospel that is, which do not safeguard the freedom and dignity of the person. It is in this sense that the term proselytism is understood in the context of the ecumenical movement: cf. The Joint Working Group between the Catholic Church and the World Council of Churches…”_      Sure, the World Council of Churches take the term ""proselytism"" that way, **precisely because many of them think evangelization is a sin**. And so the push on the idea of ""proselytism"" = bad, and try to eliminate the meaning of the term which was just fine until they came along. Trying to control the language to win the debate. And shame on the Vatican for accepting their improper constraint on the term. If you want to shame those who proselytize wrongly, SAY that ""they proselytize wrongly"".

917,"@RunDec      Given that, as I understand it, to qualify as a classical theist, a thinker has to, principally, adhere to divine simplicity, I readily concede that this is compatible with a necessitarian view, and that of many thinkers classified as such. This compatibility, however, obviously does not entail its truth. Fr. Davies seems to concern himself with rebutting the claim that divine simplicity entails it, and to achieve this he doesn’t need to positively prove the account he happens to think is the true classical theist account, namely, presumably that of St. Thomas. After all, it’s not like classical theism is a concrete comprehensive philosophical doctrine or “system” as opposed to a (contingently useful) classification abstracting from the all-important theoretical peculiarities.      Now, in light of your reference to pure act, I assumed that it is this account that you had in mind, and I submit that, I find, the way the pure act argument works is straightforward, really: agents act for an end, and where there is no necessary relation between the means and an end, there is no necessity. Because, on the one hand, God is pure act, something per se perfect, and is the only possible end for His acts, and creatures fail to contribute anything to His perfection, on the other, God cannot be said to will the creatures necessarily. See e.g. Ia q. 19 a. 3.

2353,"""If the tree of life was necessary for Adam and Eve to live forever, one might reasonably ask, did animals have access to the tree of life? The answer seems to be no.      If the tree of life was unique, it might have been enough for Adam and Eve to eat from, but it would never have been enough for all of the animals of the world to eat from. This may be another sign that the animals were not understood to have the tree of life for their food. If so, then the text of Genesis itself would suggest that, while man was meant to be immortal, animals were not. That would support the idea, based on St. Paul’s statement, that it was human death that entered the world through the Fall, not animal death.      Furthermore, we should note that giving “every green plant” to animals as food does not mean that some of them weren’t also carnivores. It’s not as if, before original sin, lions ate dandelions and toadstools and only afterward did they begin picking on poor old wildebeest. This is something Thomas Aquinas wrote about in his Summa Theologica:      In the opinion of some, those animals which now are fierce and kill others, would, in that state, have been tame, not only in regard to man, but also in regard to other animals. But this is quite unreasonable. For the nature of animals was not changed by man’s sin, as if those whose nature now it is to devour the flesh of others, would then have lived on herbs, as the lion and falcon.      (We should add, lest anyone be tempted to think that this is a forced retreat in the face of modern evolutionary theory, that Thomas wrote these words nearly 550 years prior to the birth of Charles Darwin.)""",tree life necessary adam eve live forever one might reasonably ask animal access tree life answer seems tree life unique might enough adam eve eat would never enough animal world eat may another sign animal understood tree life food text genesis would suggest man meant immortal animal would support idea based st statement human death entered world fall animal death furthermore note giving “ every green plant ” animal food mean also carnivore original sin lion ate dandelion toadstool afterward begin picking poor old wildebeest something thomas aquinas wrote summa theologica opinion animal fierce kill others would state tame regard man also regard animal quite unreasonable nature animal changed sin whose nature devour flesh others would lived herb lion falcon add lest anyone tempted think forced retreat face modern evolutionary theory thomas wrote word nearly year prior birth charles darwin,feser,1659,0

But that is not the case. Sometimes experimentation is carried out even in the absence of any well-worked out theory, in an _exploratory_ way that aims simply to see what will happen under various circumstances. Sometimes experimentation _creates_ new phenomena that would otherwise not be observed – where, precisely because they have not otherwise been observed, no theory yet exists to account for them. Sometimes experimentation _reconstitutes_ phenomena in the sense of deeply altering our understanding of them, even in the absence of theoretical considerations.

2221,"@ Infinite_Growth,      ""speaking of free will, it disturbs me greatly that traditional Catholic theology has not considered animal abuse to be a deadly sin like Lust or Gluttony. That goes very contrary to religions like Judaism or Buddhism.""      First, note of pre-Christian Judaism that it certainly permitted the use of animals   for human needs, including for rites of sacrifice. Christianity does not include the use of animals for sacrifice so from your point of view that is an improvement.      Second, note that Jesus said:      ""Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."" (Matthew 5:17-20 KJV)      But much of what is specifically listed as law in pre-Christian Judaism is subsumed in Christianity as Love rather than being specifically listed, so while abuse of animals is not listed, it is an act of hatred against what God loves, which includes all of Creation. Now we have been given all of material Creation for our proper and needful use, but an act of hatred against anything is a turning from God and is a mortal or deadly sin as Christians always understood.      So at no time did Christianity embrace the evil treatment of animals. It would have always been recognized as hate. But as in many other things, a formal doctrine against the mistreatment of animals was later worked out from these foundational principles of Christianity. It certainly is explicit now. See, for example, the Catechism as promulgated by Pope John Paul II.      Buddhism is not a development of Christianity or Judaism. Therefore, its rites and rules, while based on partial truth, are not held wholly correct. We cannot properly be directed by Bhuddhist doctrine.

The point is that the _kind_ of argumentation involved will not be a matter of forming empirical hypotheses and then testing them (using Mill’s Methods, or appealing to probability theory, or whatever). That’s just a category mistake. It is instead going to involve metaphysical reasoning that begins with much deeper facts about the world – for example, the fact that the things that make it up are compounds of essence and existence or of actuality and potentiality – and arguing that nothing that is like that could exist even for an instant without a sustaining cause that is not composite in such ways.

Now, one problem with this claim is that it simply isn’t true. A person could be angry without exhibiting the usual behavioral signs of anger, and could also exhibit those signs without actually being angry. Hence anger is something more than the behavior. Another problem is that it turns out even apart from that to be impossible entirely to analyze anger or any other mental state in entirely behavioral terms. Suppose we say that “John is angry” means “John is disposed to raise his voice, frown, stomp his feet, etc.” The trouble is that this sentence will be true only if John does not desire to hide his feelings. But if we add a reference to the absence of this desire to our definition, we’ve now got a further mentalistic concept – desire – that needs to be given a behaviorist analysis. And it turns out that to carry out such an analysis, we need to make reference to yet _further_ mental states, with _those_ now needing a behaviorist analysis, and so on _ad infinitum_.

This is pretty straightfoward here: the soul is stuck with the body limitations and so its natural capacities will be worser on a crappier body.      Take now the cartesian view were the soul is a substance whose nature is other than the body but is made to function with the body. Here the sould and the body must function together to it to work well, so a bad body will make the soul less capable of functioning.      Now take the thomistic view were the soul is the form of the body. Here things also work well, for the body is responsable for sense data, memory and imagination and the intellect(that the soul is responsable for) needs sense data everytime it needs to function*, so if the body do not work well, them the sould is screwed.

There are also the related points that one could be a heretic in the _material_ sense of affirming something doctrinally erroneous, while not being a _formal_ heretic in the sense of persisting in the error even after being warned by ecclesiastical authority; and that whether some doctrine has actually been defined by the Church is relevant to whether it is “to be believed by divine and Catholic faith.”",one point reader made word “ heresy ” used expansive way earlier church history today correct important something elsewhere emphasized myselfhttpsedwardfeserblogspotcompopes-heresy-and-papal- heresyhtml modern canon law heresy “ obstinate denial obstinate doubt reception baptism truth believed divine catholic faith ” pope honorius definitely heretic sense evidence obstinacy part charitable reading problematic statement support judgment intend undermine traditional teaching even word inadvertently effect also related point one could heretic material sense affirming something doctrinally erroneous formal heretic sense persisting error even warned ecclesiastical authority whether doctrine actually defined church relevant whether “ believed divine catholic faith ”,feser,1204,0

If they do, why baptize them?      ""Accordingly, what is in question here is man in all his truth, in his full magnitude. We are not dealing with the ""abstract"" man, but the real, ""concrete"", ""historical"" man. We are dealing with ""each"" man, for each one is included in the mystery of the Redemption and with each one Christ has united himself for ever through this mystery. Every man comes into the world through being conceived in his mother's womb and being born of his mother, and precisely on account of the mystery of the Redemption is entrusted to the solicitude of the Church. Her solicitude is about the whole man and is focussed on him in an altogether special manner. The object of her care is man in his unique unrepeatable human reality, which keeps intact the image and likeness of God himself92. The Council points out this very fact when, speaking of that likeness, it recalls that ""man is the only creature on earth that God willed for itself""93.

In the above example given by our esteemed Anonymous above, if we assume 1=2, does it STILL remain true that ""equals subtracted from equals make equals"", which he uses to get the second step?

473,"Alexander R Pruss: ""there is no objective reason to do or believe anything""      You cannot believe anything at will. Nor are your choices to do something are ever free, even if they seem to be so. All your beliefs and choices to act are predetermined by your genetic makeup and past experiences, which express themselves in the current emotional/cognitive (that is, biochemical) state of your brain. This hypothesis is simpler than to suppose some immaterial stuff, whose interaction with material things, including the brain, would be beyond comprehension.   Also note that being rational is not somehow ""inherently better"" than being irrational or arational. Rather, it's just that rationality is the kind of attitude that pays off most of the time in the long run. And even this ""paying-off"" translates to things that support the survival of the individual, so it can be expressed in value-neutral terms.      ""every reason expresses the value of the thing it is a reason for""   This is false.   For example, if you know that p, and also know that ""if p, then q"", then this knowledge, together with knowledge of the rule of inference ""modus ponens"" may be a reason for you to believe (and, also know) that q. But there is nothing that expresses the ""value of q"" in the state of knowing p, ""if p, then q"", or in knowing ""modus ponens"", nor in its application. They are just propositions, syntactic structures with semantic interpretation according to classical logic. And there are many other alternative systems of logic, even some where modus ponens is not a theorem.",alexander r pruss objective reason believe anything believe anything choice something ever free even seem belief choice act predetermined genetic makeup past experience express current emotionalcognitive biochemical state brain hypothesis simpler suppose immaterial stuff whose interaction material thing including brain would beyond comprehension also note rational somehow inherently better irrational arational rather rationality kind attitude pay time long run even paying-off translates thing support survival individual expressed value-neutral term every reason express value thing reason false example know p also know p q knowledge together knowledge rule inference modus ponens may reason believe also know q nothing express value q state knowing p p q knowing modus ponens application proposition syntactic structure semantic interpretation according classical logic many alternative system logic even modus ponens theorem,pruss,1572,1
1263,"@Tony:      ""I would suggest that the principle only holds within a constrained , limited context, and not absolutely - for the reason that ""equals"" does not inherently mean ""the same in every possible respect"". In the realm of quantity, if you are speaking of one aspect of the two referents x and y, x=y may well imply f(x) = f(y) because you have limited the context of the ""is equal"" itself. But it doesn't hold in every respect if x is not the same as y in every respect. If x is ""8"" and y is ""4 + 4"" and z is ""3 + 5"", then they are not the same in respect of ""expressed as a whole singular"" versus ""expressed as a sum of equal parts"" or ""expressed as a sum of primes""""      The = sign *does* stand for identical; the names in both sides of the sign name the same, identical thing.

I should clarify that I am *not* dismissing any criticisms of first order logic, or even saying that this way of talking is the best way of talking in every possible practical and theoretical subject. To give a simple, obvious example, as far as I know there is no good satisfactory account of intensional contexts. This way of talking entails no contradictions (or at least any obvious ones) and is especially useful in mathematics though; part of the reasons are certainly contingent and reflect the way how mathematicians are trained, but I would contend that they also reflect a deep intuition. Mathematical objects are simple in the sense that their identity conditions are sharp and clearly delineated -- they are the furthest removed from the material. Virtually all of mathematics can be formalized in ZFC, possibly with some extra large cardinal axioms; *equality* itself can be defined in terms of the other primitives (in symbols: x = y iff forall z, z e x <=> z e y). In this setting, we have: (1) *everything* is a set and (2) *everything* can be constructed bottom up from the empty set via (possibly transfinite) iteration. This is a large amount of reduction and simplification, yielding a powerful framework. But to circle back to the criticisms, it also has its downsides. Now suddenly, it make senses to ask the non-sensical question if the number 5 is an element of the number 1023. This question has a definite truth value but its value depends on the specific, non-essential details of the construction of the natural numbers in ZFC.",tony would suggest principle hold within constrained limited context absolutely - reason equal inherently mean every possible respect realm quantity speaking one aspect two referent x xy may well imply fx fy limited context equal hold every respect x every respect x z respect expressed whole singular versus expressed sum equal part expressed sum prime sign stand identical name side sign name identical thing far putative counter-examples would say response longer talking even aspect thing altogether somehow related -- expression tree additive prime decomposition partition whatever else mind clarify dismissing criticism first order logic even saying way talking best way talking every possible practical theoretical subject give simple obvious example far know good satisfactory account intensional context way talking entail contradiction least obvious one especially useful mathematics though part reason certainly contingent reflect way mathematician trained would contend also reflect deep intuition mathematical object simple sense identity condition sharp clearly delineated -- furthest removed material virtually mathematics formalized zfc possibly extra large cardinal axiom equality defined term primitive symbol x iff forall z z e x z e setting everything set everything constructed bottom empty set via possibly transfinite iteration large amount reduction simplification yielding powerful framework circle back criticism also downside suddenly make sens ask non-sensical question number element number question definite truth value value depends specific non-essential detail construction natural number zfc,feser,2648,0

4343,"Walter,      I don't think I understand your response. I did not mean to suggest that God could not have stopped the Fall (if ""the Fall"" happened; I was just using that as an example) with sheer power, but rather that a world like ours in which the Fall happened might be better than a world in which the Fall never happened. Or that, from the point of view of perfect rationality, one should not have attempted to prevent the Fall. It seems to me that there are many possible reasons, even beyond our ken, for why God could not have prevented the Fall without some immorality, or perhaps without sacrificing a greater good that could morally justify his inaction.      I do not deny that there is a plausibility to thinking that, prima facie, if God existed, the world should look a lot better than it is. Speaking for myself, I think it raises the probability of atheism to some degree, but I find it very hard to go beyond a prima facie impression here. It seems the problem of evil would require us to adopt a ""God's eye"" point of view that I don't think people can reliably have (I certainly can't have it, at the moment).

1880,"@Laudator Temporis Acti      That other fallible humans have a subjective certainty Y, that contradicts a subjective certainty X belonging to my own fallible self, is no proof that X could not be recognised by me as objectively valid. (As with the colour of Fluffy the cat in my previous post) it's only a problem if all I knew about X and Y were that they were beliefs belonging to this or that person.      If all the knowledge that we had access to was that 'I believe X, you believe Y', then since we are all fallible, there would be no grounds for preferring X over Y in regard to their objective certainty.      But the presupposition that all the knowledge to which we have access is of the form 'I believe X, you believe Y', is a type of philosophical idealism: 'All we can directly know is the fact that something is someone's belief - we cannot have direct knowledge of evidence for these beliefs in themselves, whereby we can discriminate which are true and which are false.'      But we do not grant this unproven idealist presupposition (which furthermore is contradicted by our very experience of having direct awareness of evidence); and so we are not led to the relativist conclusion.      In short, we are not reduced to saying, 'Fallible person A says X, fallible person B says Y - who knows?' Each fallible individual can turn to the actual evidence, by which valid objective certainties can be established in particular cases - even if in other particular cases, someone (myself or others) fails to properly examine the evidence, and so actualizes in those particular cases the abstract possibility of falling into error.      I agree that my background and life history makes it more likely for me to have ended up a Catholic than e.g. a Hindu. But that proves nothing. My background also makes it more likely that I will have a valid objective certainty of Pythagoras' Theorem, than if I had been born in 3000 BC. For every individual, particular contingent circumstances channel us into a position where we are more favourably placed than we otherwise would have been to discover objective evidence for this or that truth. That does not invalidate our objective certainty of those truths, once we have seen the evidence. Again the principle: we must examine the actual evidence regarding X (not matters about our background that are logically irrelevant to the truth or falsity of X).      And just on a couple of your other points:      I can agree for the sake of argument that Newman's example regarding the trustworthiness of John or Richard is for our purposes the least satisfactory of his examples, since the nature of the 'evidence' for their trustworthiness raises all sorts of other questions. (His example is nonetheless perhaps a useful corrective against modelling our understanding of certainty primarily on our experience of mathematical certainty, rather than on e.g. certainties that occur in interpersonal relationships.)      And the passive infallibility (according to Catholic teaching) of the whole Body of the Faithful guided by the Holy Spirit, has no bearing on the topic of an admittedly fallible individual, Catholic or not, coming to a valid objective certainty in a particular case, by rationally examining evidence.

1337,"Even if we look at Eric Perl's treatment of Plotinus's so-called 'necessary emmanation' we see that there is an aspect of necessity involved in it. Perl says on pg. 50 of Theophany, ""The necessity of procession, therefore, is in no sense a limitation on the One, but rather an expression of his absolute freedom from any limiting condition whatsoever."" He's clearly denying that the One is constrained by any 'condition,' but that is something the Thomist would also accept. The 'necessity' refers not to the any external condition, but his pure productivity itself. As Perl says, ""For if the One might not produce being, then his productive activity would be distinct from himself and he would be condition by a relation to his product.""      Why is this relevant? Well, one of the arguments of Perl's book is a situating of Pseudo-Dionysius within a Plotinian and Procline metaphysics. So, Perl goes on to state that ""For Dionysius, as for Plotinus, God is nothing but the making of all things, so that the possibility of not making does not arise.... As in Plotinus, to produce all things is not a ""choice"" on God's part... That God cannot not create is a consequence, not a limitation, of his absolute transcendence, his unrelatedness to that which proceeds from him."" Pg. 52      I mean this is the absolute best I can do to make sense of Hart's position - interpret it through the Dionysian idea of diffusive goodness and love. And Hart's supporters frequently point out that he's operating within this 'Neoplatonic and Dionysian tradition,' so my move appears to be justified.      But, an appeal to Denys or the Neoplatonic tradition isn't any argument or textual exegesis, and it seems to me that Dionysius is still subject to the same criticisms raised in Ed's post.

(Davies’ views on this issue were the subject of [another post from years ago](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2010/05/davies-on-divine-simplicity-and- freedom.html).) Critics of divine simplicity often argue that it is incompatible with God’s having freely created the universe. For if God could have done other than what he has in fact done, doesn’t that entail that God is changeable, contrary to divine simplicity? And if he is in fact unchangeable or immutable, doesn’t that entail that he could not have done otherwise, and thus created of necessity rather than freely? In response, Davies points out, first, that creating _freely_ simply does not in fact entail _changing_. Certainly it simply begs the question to assume otherwise. For the classical theist, God creates _eternally_ or atemporally, and what is eternal or atemporal does not undergo change.

3727,"Hi ccmnxc and The Deuce,      For the record, I broke with the ID movement back in 2016, after concluding that its scientific claims didn't add up and that its mathematical arguments were invalid.      The Thomistic version of hylomorphism espoused by Koons (and by Ed) is quite radical. What it says is that a proton which is part of a human body isn't a proton: the constituent particles of ordinary objects are ""only potentially rather than actually entities in their own right,"" as Ed succinctly puts it in his review. The claim being made here is not just that they're only potentially independent; rather, what Thomists claim is that they're only potentially entities. However, Albert the Great and Duns Scotus held a different view: namely, that the human body contains forms at multiple levels, which means that the particles comprising it are still particles.      A physicist will tell you that the protons in a human body are indistinguishable from free-floating protons, and that their properties undergo no change when that body dies. This indicates that they do not cease to be entities, when they're incorporated into a human body.      I might add that there is a fundamental dis-analogy between quantum indeterminacy and the Aristotelian notion of potency. According to Aristotle, while an object is only potentially F, it is not actually F. By contrast, with quantum indeterminacy, when some property of a particle (say, its spin) is not defined (say, ""up-or-down"", or ""F-or-G""), we cannot say it is not actually F (""up""); all we can say is that it is not (actually) up-and-not-down (F-and- not-G) or down-and not-up (G-and-not-F).      The discovery of indefinite properties at the micro-level has no bearing on the question of whether we need to invoke the concept of potency to account for accidental or substantial change at the macro-level.      Finally, while I agree with Ed that radical atomism and radical holism pose a threat to Christianity, I would suggest that the antidote is not radical hylomorphism, but a more nuanced view, which recognizes that ordinary-level may be viewed as fundamental from one perspective, as aggregates from another perspective, and as modifications of a larger whole from yet another perspective.

2256,"""Being infinitely good, would it not go against His nature to choose a lesser good, as against a better one? Similarly, would it not go against His nature to to choose not to create, if He knows that the choice to create is better?""      I am also puzzled by this. But since I am not bound by dogma, I am open to accepting that God creates out of a necessity of his perfect nature. But it'd be nice if it can be avoided.      So there's a lot to be said about this, and what I'll mention doesn't come close to covering the whole topic, but I think it's an interesting thought, and maybe an escape route. Consider: one could deny that perfect goodness MUST entail always doing the best, if the best is supererogatory. The very notion of a supererogatory action is that it's a good action you can perform without being anything like an obligation. We can imagine you can, for instance, donate 100 dollars to a charity right now, and it would be good and virtuous of you, but it wouldn't be an obligation. You can fail to do it without thereby incurring in sin or evil.      I think creation might be a supererogatory good like that.

4352,"I agree that some instances of suffering that happen in the world does indeed help us to realise and understand the goodness of God. It manifests his goodness in so far as his mercy is enough to restore even the most broken of souls and we do see examples of this. The way in which God has arranged things does give way to a lot of instances where he brings a greater good out of all the evil that is taken place, the most stark example being the crucifixion which God used to manifest his infinite mercy. Pope John Paul II as well as Thomas Aquinas have both referred to God's mercy has his greatest attribute, that attribute which displays his goodness in the greatest way since God is below no one. And to top it all it was implemented by means of an Incarnation. All these great goods would not have been possible to us in a world without sin even if an Incarnation had taken place in that world because God's mercy would have been conceivable to us only by contemplating the act of creation which would be very abstract. In this world his mercy was on its fullest display. We deserved punishment but God gave us the opposite.   Having said all that though, I think these instances serve to show us that God can indeed bring greater goods out of great evils and we can trust him in that regard. They form parts of the reason why God has permitted suffering. And it's true in a general sense. At the same time there are such ghastly acts that humans commit, that it's hard to believe that God allowed that person to suffer like that just because doesn't want that person to get attached to this world, it's even worse to propose that it was deserved as punishment. In such cases solace should be derived from the fact that even such ghastly trauma can be healed by God's mercy and at the same time refrain from attributing any reason to God for permitting it since we truly aren't in a position to know why. God himself points to our cluelessness in the book of Job. In previous posts on suffering Prof usually did underscore this point regarding particular cases atleast up untill last years Christmas message where he posited that we can't fathom why God has permitted the crisis in church to go on for so long.

54,"To be clear, I don’t doubt that the example works. It does, and it illustrates a genuine problem with the view that belief is (or is justified by) credence above a threshold. Specifically, this violates an apparently natural reflection principle, that if I rationally believe that I will rationally come to believe, then I should believe now. Issues like this seem unavoidable with a threshold (other than 1). The lottery paradox illustrates a different one: violation of logical closure. Of course, you may be prepared to live with such issues - maybe beliefs don’t have to be logically consistent.         My problem with the threshold approach is more basic. If I don’t have a credence, I can’t apply the threshold test. If I do have a credence, then noting whether it is above or below a threshold adds nothing useful. One response to this is straight Bayesianism, which rejects any role for belief (beyond credence 1). Another is that credence and belief are separate and related, but not straightforwardly.

3333,"The famous paragraph slipped into the Fourth Council of Constantinople’s deliberations had more to do with the inflamed politics of the East than the wrongs of Pope Honorius. The Lateran Council of 649, rejecting Monothelitism, had blamed the orientals, making no mention of Pope Honorius. Pope Agatho got his legates to bring to the Council of Constantinople a letter in which he stated: “From the day when the leaders of the Church of Constantinople tried to introduce heretical novelties in the immaculate Church of Christ, my predecessors never ceased to exhort them… that they had to abstain… [from proclaiming the error concerning the single will etc.]”.      The Council’s machinations contradicted Pope Agatho and resulted in a wording that was modified by Pope Leo II (upon receiving notice of its deliberations) when he ratified it. This was the version he then sent to Constantinople and all the bishops of the West. Pope Leo, in his explanation of the affair to the bishops of Spain, clearly distinguished between the list of heretics named by the Council, and Pope Honorius, censured for being negligent.         In a long article in the Dictionnaire de theolgie catholique (1931, the DTC was in another league entirely from the estimable Catholic Encyclopedia), Fr. E. Amann, professor of theology at Strasbourg, concludes: “For us, the two letters of Pope Honorius represent a doctrinal intervention of the Roman pontiff in a debated question: referring to previous decisions, without adding anything new to them except in manner, the pope teaches the theory of the two natures, each operating according to what is proper to it, and demands entire acceptance of this doctrine. Alongside this doctrinal teaching is a very unfortunate prescription on the silence to be kept relative to the formulas in dispute, ‘one or two energies’”.      He concludes that “… [Honorius’] thought carries greater weight than the formulas by which he expresses it, that these formulas themselves can with the greatest rigor uphold an interpretation which does not deviate too much from official orthodoxy. But to conclude from this, as many theologians have done, the perfect orthodoxy of the two letters of Honorius, there is, it seems, some distance.”      Had the Council made a dangerous mistake? “It would certainly have done so if, taking the question from an exclusively dogmatic point of view, it had passed a doctrinal and pointless judgment on the very teaching of Honorius….[because Honorius was basically orthodox, despite his expressions in these letters] the assembly set itself up as judge much less of a theology than of a type of conduct and those who engaged in it”.      The weak arguments made by some theologians mentioned in the post do not devalue their stronger ones – which don’t get a proper mention; the question of the Pope losing the faith, the issue of formal heresy dealt with by Bellarmine, surely deserves some explanation. As far as the history goes, Pope Honorius was NOT a heretic, and Fr. Chapman’s 100 page work does not establish it.      I think there is a distinction between ex cathedra infallibility (which permits no stain of error) and the foibles of Popes at other times which, however much destruction they cause, does not translate into meaning they can lose the faith. Obviously we aren’t expected to believe that off the cuff “magisterium” on planes is not free from tendentiousness to the point of destructive favouring of whatever error is in fashion. That the man doing this will not lose the faith, ever, is in line with what Vatican One defined concerning the Faith of the See of Rome that would not fail until the end of time. Reducing this to the extraction of ex cathedra statements one a century from men who could otherwise have no faith, or renounce Christ, seems more like the speech of Balaam’s ass.

The fact that _councils and later_ _popes themselves_ have denounced him as a heretic is also crucial, for to deny that he was a heretic is thereby to challenge the judgment of these councils and popes.

855,"Hi Ed,      I respectfully put it to you that the Thomistic doctrine of Divine simplicity you're defending here has passed its use-by date, for the following reasons:      1\. It isn't taught by the Church, which merely affirms that God has “one essence, substance, or nature absolutely simple” (Lateran IV, 1215). There's nothing here about whether God has contingent thoughts, plans or intentions in his capacity as Creator of the cosmos, in addition to possessing a nature which is necessary.      2\. It's totally unscriptural. The Bible depicts God as explicitly declaring, ""My thoughts [plural] are not your thoughts"" (Isaiah 55:8), in a verse affirming Divine transcendence (which is the last place where one would expect anthropomorphic language, so I can only assume it's literal). The Psalmist adds: ""How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How vast is the sum of them!"" (Psalm 139:17). Thomists, on the other hand, believe that God does not have multiple thoughts; instead, He has only one thought, viz., His thought of Himself, and He knows creatures by knowing Himself.      3\. It's grounded in a philosophically dubious ontology: creatures are said to be compounds of essence and existence, while God alone is an Act of Pure and Infinite Existence, which is incapable of possessing any modifications or attributes (such as thoughts and intentions). However, the arguments for a real distinction between essence and existence in creatures prove no such thing: all they prove is that matter and form are distinct (which is why I can know what a Thylacine [or Tasmanian tiger] is, without knowing whether it currently exists or not: I don't know for sure if its form is still instantiated anywhere on Earth). What's more, the notion of Pure Existence is utterly vague: it is indefinite rather than infinite. Better to say, rather, that God is the Ultimate Yardstick of existence. He defines what it means for us to exist, for ""in him we live, and move, and have our being"" (Acts 17:28).      4\. Thomists also contend that God, the Author of nature, could have made a different world, or no world at all, without having any different mental acts, such as intentions. That's like an author saying, “I could have written a totally different story, or even no story at all, without there being any difference in my intentions.”      5\. Why is there a world? The Thomist’s answer is: “Because God.” But if there were a different world, or no world at all, the Thomist's reply would be the same: ""Because God."" I respectfully submit that any explanation which is elastic enough to account for BOTH the world’s occurrence AND its non- occurrence is not doing the work of an explanation at all. It's vacuous.      6\. Finally, if there's one thing Scripture is quite clear about, it is that God is a Father. And as the doctrine of the Trinity shows, even without creating anything, He'd still be one. That's a basic fact about God, and it shows He's personal all the way down.",hi ed respectfully put thomistic doctrine divine simplicity defending passed use-by date following reason taught church merely affirms god “ one essence substance nature absolutely simple ” lateran iv nothing whether god contingent thought plan intention capacity creator cosmos addition possessing nature necessary totally unscriptural bible depicts god explicitly declaring thought plural thought isaiah verse affirming divine transcendence last place one would expect anthropomorphic language assume literal psalmist add precious also thought god vast sum psalm thomists hand believe god multiple thought instead one thought viz thought know creature knowing grounded philosophically dubious ontology creature said compound essence existence god alone act pure infinite existence incapable possessing modification attribute thought intention however argument real distinction essence existence creature prove thing prove matter form distinct know thylacine tasmanian tiger without knowing whether currently exists know sure form still instantiated anywhere earth notion pure existence utterly vague indefinite rather infinite better say rather god ultimate yardstick existence defines mean u exist live move act thomists also contend god author nature could made different world world without different mental act intention like author saying “ could written totally different story even story without difference intention ” world answer “ god ” different world world reply would god respectfully submit explanation elastic enough account occurrence non- occurrence work explanation vacuous finally one thing scripture quite clear god father doctrine trinity show even without creating anything still one basic fact god show personal way,feser,2992,0
2962,"@the most recently posting anonymous.      I am not sure what you are talking about in stating that there are no Scriptures that teach that people are in hell. Did you not read all of what I wrote above? Christ says, ""few will find it"" (the narrow road that leads to heaven). So would you have us believe that those making no effort to find and follow the narrow path, will ultimately land themselves precisely on that path without the slightest effort? So, Christ will save them without their willing to be saved? Well, that is contrary to Catholic teaching as Trent taught definitively that we must cooperate with God's grace.      This includes following the warning of Christ to ""make every effort to enter through the narrow gate"". Your reading would require that this should be interpreted: ""You don't really need to make any effort at all because everyone will (or might) get into heave without being on the path or without trying."" Well, as I said above, that is not an ""interpretation"" it is a rejection of our Lord's words.      So, yes, we do have revelation that has made clear that ""few will find it"" (the path to salvation). Again, if you think that they will arrive at their destination by some path other than the narrow path that Christ names, where on earth did you get such wisdom to know more than our Lord how we get to Heaven? Perhaps you have been there and can guide us in this new path that you have in mind. Please tell us about it. Is it broad and easy? That sounds alot nicer than the narrow path. Please tell us more.

2957,"@Michael @Talmid @AnonWCB      That was incredible, you are amazing guys. Thank you so much for the in-depth answers. That helped a lot.      I asked that because of the time I've been passing through life in the last 3 years. My life has been a lot miserably. So it's nice to know that - even though it's hard to imagine how in one act - God is listening to my prayers. But I won't lose my faith.      In case you guys were curious about that it has to do with things that happened before I meet Ed's blog. My life - my family - life has always been pretty harsh. And to worsen all that I have OCD. My grandmother on my father- side died of Alzheimer and I'm afraid that my father would develop that too. My mother lost her job due to an injustice that happened to her during the pandemic and all that bullshit.      But the worst thing that doesn't seem to go away is the depression and trauma that my OCD contributed to. I was very very influenced by Libet's ''experiment'' back then and unfortunately, I acknowledge a fella named Sam Harris with all that mysticism about 'no self' etc. (that seemed to follow from the experiment's conclusion), and since then that stuck in my head - not because I believed it - even though I had a weak spot for materialism and 'took it for granted' because you know ''science'' mentality that I was influenced to. The problem was (somehow still) the fact that I didn't even know how to defend myself from all that (i.e that the experiment methods were bogus, that the rest doesn't necessarily follow from it). And the implication with all of that in my life was the fact that if that is true, life is simply worse than it seems. There is just pain and suffering. What weighed more than one hundred pounds for me was the fact that I simply love my mom and my family and if there was no free will, no God, and we were somehow unreal because there was no self (nothing that lasts or abides)... I don't need to paint the rest of the picture to see how evil, atrocious, and how I felt and still feel because I have nightmares and traumas with that till nowadays.      In the midway path between that, I found Ed's blog and began to read it - even emailed him one time. And that gave me hope that there was a God after all and that those things could be false.      But even so, buddhist claims from Harris traumatized me a lot and due to my OCD, I still suffer from them till today. Deep there, I confess I'm really afraid that something evil like that is possibly true. Because it's an even worse version of materialism with all its adorns.      Based on what I've learned from Ed's books and posts I tried to read some authors from that and engaged against it for some time (authors like Jay Garfield and Mark Siderits)      (I will continue)",michael talmid anonwcb incredible amazing guy thank much in-depth answer helped lot asked time passing life last year life lot miserably nice know - even though hard imagine one act - god listening prayer lose faith case guy curious thing happened meet blog life - family - life always pretty harsh worsen ocd grandmother father- side died alzheimer afraid father would develop mother lost job due injustice happened pandemic bullshit worst thing seem go away depression trauma ocd contributed influenced experiment back unfortunately acknowledge fella named sam harris mysticism etc seemed follow conclusion since stuck head - believed - even though weak spot materialism took know science mentality influenced problem somehow still fact even know defend ie experiment method bogus rest necessarily follow implication life fact true life simply worse seems pain suffering weighed one hundred pound fact simply love mom family free god somehow unreal self nothing last abides need paint rest picture see evil atrocious felt still feel nightmare trauma till nowadays midway path found blog began read - even emailed one time gave hope god thing could false even buddhist claim harris traumatized lot due ocd still suffer till today deep confess really afraid something evil like possibly true even worse version materialism adorns based learned book post tried read author engaged time author like jay garfield mark siderits continue,feser,2777,0

1582,"I've been reading through the complete works of C. S. Lewis for the past 7-8 months. (Reading through his works by genre). When I got to his non-fiction ""popular works"" (such as Mere Christianity, Miracles, etc.), I was surprised that his descriptions of God sound similar to the Classical Theist understanding of God. (At least in some cases). Below are a few quotes from Lewis's books (possibly) showing this.      For each quote, the name of the book (and chapter) comes first.      In this first quote when Lewis uses the word ""Dualism"" he means ""Cosmic Dualism"" (the belief in 2 equal opposite powers that control the universe, one good and the other evil), not ""Substance Dualism"". In this article he's responding to C. E. M. Joad, a British philosopher who was arguing in favor of Cosmic Dualism. (Lewis wrote this essay while WWII was happening).      (God in the Dock, Part 1, Chapter 1 ""Evil and God"")   (Quote)   ""We are left then to choose between monotheism and dualism—between a single, good, almighty source of being, and two equal, uncreated, antagonistic Powers, one good and the other bad. Dr. Joad suggests that the latter view stands to gain from the ‘new urgency’ of the fact of evil. But what new urgency? Evil may seem more urgent to us than it did to the Victorian philosophers—favoured members of the happiest class in the happiest country in the world at the world’s happiest period. But it is no more urgent for us than for the great majority of monotheists all down the ages. The classic expositions of the doctrine that the world’s miseries are compatible with its creation and guidance by a wholly good Being come from Boethius waiting in prison to be beaten to death and from St Augustine meditating on the sack of Rome. The present state of the world is normal; it was the last century that was the abnormality.   This drives us to ask why so many generations rejected Dualism. Not, assuredly, because they were unfamiliar with suffering; and not because its obvious prima facie plausibility escaped them. It is more likely that they saw its two fatal difficulties, the one metaphysical, and the other moral.   The metaphysical difficulty is this. The two Powers, the good and the evil, do not explain each other. Neither Ormuzd nor Ahriman can claim to be the Ultimate. More ultimate than either of them is the inexplicable fact of their being there together. Neither of them chose this tête-à-tête. Each of them, therefore, is conditioned—finds himself willy-nilly in a situation; and either that situation itself, or some unknown force which produced that situation, is the real Ultimate. Dualism has not yet reached the ground of being. You cannot accept two conditioned and mutually independent beings as the self-grounded, self-comprehending Absolute. On the level of picture-thinking this difficulty is symbolised by our inability to think of Ormuzd and Ahriman without smuggling in the idea of a common space in which they can be together and thus confessing that we are not yet dealing with the source of the universe but only with two members contained in it.

Bradshaw also notes that Basil the Great rejects the idea that God creates “without choice, as the body is the cause of shadow and light the cause of brightness” (where he obviously takes these effects of the body and of light to be necessitated by them); and that Gregory of Nyssa holds that God created “ _not by any necessity_ … but because it was fitting.”",father also understand divine freedom way rule necessitated david bradshaw noteshttpsafkimelfileswordpresscomdivine-freedom-in-greek- fatherspdf clement alexandria say “ god good necessity choice ” conflict christian doctrine god positively evil understand clement meaning god could evil instead good rather could refrain acting rather good action bradshaw also note basil great reject idea god creates “ without choice body cause shadow light cause brightness ” obviously take effect body light necessitated gregory nyssa hold god created “ necessity … fitting ”,feser,934,0

Well, now Mr. Jindra, why don't you tell us what counts as evidence and how you arrived at the conclusion that your proposal is true. What I suspect you mean by evidence is ""empircally verifiable"". In other words, it has to be something that you can see to count as evidence. Or put in the terms of the debate it has to be material to count as evidence. So for someone to show you that the immaterial exists, you need them to show it to you in material form. Well that makes about as much sense as you standing behind the podium doing the macarena, now doesn't it.      In philosophy 101 and basic logic, students learn that this is called ""begging the question"". You are assuming the very thing that needs to be proven and you are requiring that this assumption also be taken by others as the only means to show you that it is not true. Oh what a wicked web we weave.      So the assertion that ""knowledge requires empirical verification"" is itself *not verifiable by its own criteria*. Those insisting upon it are either unreflective or like to impose heavy burdens on the backs of others that they themselves don't have to carry.

3773,"I posted the stuff above about GC. The standard view about elements in Aristotle is this:   "". For Aristotle an element of something is the most basic constituent of that thing. It is indivisible into   things that are different in form, which is to say that it cannot be analysed into further constituents - or 'elements' - of its own. The elements of bodies, then, are the simplest constituents of bodies (Metaph. V.3, 10l4a26-34, De cáelo III. 3, 302al4-21). ... Aristotle analyses fire, air, water, and earth into more fundamental constituents. Consequently the latter - usually believed to be the primary   'qualities', the contraries hot and cold, dry and wet, and often also 'prime   matter' - are more deserving of the name στοιχεία, or 'elements'. These items - the contraries alone, or together with prime matter - are considered the true elements of bodies because together they compose fire, air, water, and earth... in his view, fire, air, water, and earth are not elements strictly speaking, because they reveal under analysis further, more fundamental, that is, more elemental, items."" ~ Timothy J. Crowley, Phronesis 2008.      In the Meteorologica, Ari says that what we call fire is different from ""real fire,"" which is an excess of heat. The problem I'm puzzling over - and not just now, though Prof. Feser's review recalled it - is what happens when, say, a hot thing is destroyed. ""The hot"" in it doesn't just poof out of actuality and revert to prime matter. Something hot is left over and is a constituent of a new thing. So it's a puzzle, how ""the hot"" would NOT be a constituent of either the prior or the subsequent heated substance.      This question recurs when we substitute protons and neutrons or whatever for ""the hot/cold/wet/dry."" For Aristotle, ""an 'element', strictly speaking, is the primary material constituent into which bodies divide, or into which bodies can be analysed {Metaph. V.3, 10l4a31-34; De cáelo III.3, 302al4-19; cf.   Metaph. III.3, 998a22-b4; cf. Metaph. VII. 17, 104lb31: στοιχεῖον δ' εστίν εἰς ὃ διαιρεῖται ἐνυπάρχον ὡς ὕλη)"" ~ Crowley.      One may say, we never have ""the hot"" just by itself apart from substances that are hot. On the other hand, ""the hot"" bridges across corruption and generation, so it's hard to see how it exists only potentially apart from either substance. It does work during the bridge, so it seems to persist in act. Lindsay Judson said in a colloquium that what persists from corruption to generation is just the hot's ""extension.""

4221,"God's act of creation is God's very essence. That's why creation is a mistery we can not fully grasp. But I think we can show that this doctrine is coherent - or, at least, we can show that the arguments against this doctrine fail.      God has but one act of will - the act by which God wills himself. And God wills everything in the act of willing himself. This Divine Act is the same in every possible world. However, just as a point can be considered as the maximal or the minimum point of different parabolas, or the zero of many different lines, God's Will can be considered as the source of different worlds. His act of Will is really the same, but virtually distinct across possible worlds.      In fact, Saint Thomas says in the Summa contra Gentiles that sometimes a causa has a non-necessary relation with its effects. During the Middle Ages, of course, he was not aware of any probabilistic events - intrinsically probabilistic, I mean, like Quantum Mechanics. But his answer has this deep insight: a cause may produce its effects, not out of necessity, but randomly or because of a free choice.      The argument against Divine Simplicity shifts, at this point, towards intentional directedness. But here I think the argument presupposes an anthropomorphic conception of Divine Choice. We do not know anything about God's psychological life. We can not affirm nor deny the possibility of choosing different things in the same Divine Act.      A final observation: English is not my first language. I hope my text is clear and understandable, despite some mistakes.",god act creation essence creation mistery fully grasp think show doctrine coherent - least show argument doctrine fail god one act - act god will god will everything act willing divine act every possible world however point considered maximal minimum point different parabola zero many different line considered source different world act really virtually distinct across possible world fact saint thomas say summa contra gentile sometimes causa non-necessary relation effect middle age course aware probabilistic event - intrinsically probabilistic mean like quantum mechanic answer deep insight cause may produce effect necessity randomly free choice argument divine simplicity shift point towards intentional directedness think argument presupposes anthropomorphic conception divine choice know anything psychological life affirm deny possibility choosing different thing divine act final observation english first language hope text clear understandable despite mistake,feser,1577,0

824,"Walter,      Libertarian freedom entails that you can, at the same time, have non- determining reasons for doing X and non-determining reasons for not-doing-X. What is the intention, beyond the choosing of one over the other? It is when you intend (and hence have chosen) to do one instead of the other, and thus are ready intending the action. If the intention is not the choice, then it would be the motivation. And in both cases there is no difference between our case of LFW and God's:      Before I finally make my choice, I have motivations for X and ~X. In w1 I go on to choose X; in w2 I go on to choose ~X. And yet there is no difference in my intrinsic properties between w1 and w2.      This is what is weird in LFW, but as explained, it is the same for God as well as for us. So this is no objection against divine simplicity per se.      But perhaps you think that the ""intention"" is neither the choosing nor the motivation, but an accompanying mental state that is always present when, and only when, a choice is made. In that case, the intention would NOT be a necessary condition for a choice being made. Because if it were, we would never be able to choose anything, since we would have to choose our intention before being able to make a choice, and that is circular or regressive. I can, under motivations for both X and ~X, and with no intention whatsoever (since I haven't made the choice yet), choose to do X or ~X and thus effectively, freely bring about X or ~X without this ""intention"" entity/property. So God's having or not having an intention in this case would be irrelevant for his power to choose, but it ALSO is the same for us.      But if the the problem is that God must be different when he chooses X as opposed to ~X, then again this would not work under libertarian freedom for us as either. Because (again) when you choose between X (in w1) or ~X (in w2), the cause of your choice has exactly the same intrinsic properties between worlds. The cause of your choosing X in w1 is you at t in state S; and the cause of your choosing ~X in w2 is you at t in state S. There is a branching, and yet there is no difference in intrinsic properties of you at t between worlds. So, once again: it is the same for us and God, and libertarian freedom does not require subjects to change in intrinsic properties between worlds in order to make choices.",walter libertarian freedom entail time non- determining reason x non-determining reason not-doing-x intention beyond choosing one intend hence chosen one instead thus ready intending action intention choice would motivation case difference case lfw finally make choice motivation x x w go choose x w go choose x yet difference intrinsic property w w weird lfw explained god well u objection divine simplicity per se perhaps think intention neither choosing motivation accompanying mental state always present choice made case intention would necessary condition choice made would never able choose anything since would choose intention able make choice circular regressive motivation x x intention whatsoever since made choice yet choose x x thus effectively freely bring x x without intention entityproperty intention case would irrelevant power choose also u problem god must different chooses x opposed x would work libertarian freedom u either choose x w x w cause choice exactly intrinsic property world cause choosing x w state cause choosing x w state branching yet difference intrinsic property world u god libertarian freedom require subject change intrinsic property world order make choice,feser,2377,0

1971,"@Ed Feser      So why believe Chapman over Bellarmine?      Seems the problem is the term ""heresy"" has undergone a development over the past 2000 years.

The difference between the views is that theistic personalists reject divine simplicity and, as a consequence, often reject other classical attributes such as immutability, impassibility, and eternity.

1626,"@anonymous.      What does or does not ""seem heretical"" to you is not the criteria by which something is or is not heretical. The position you are describing is a position that has been condemned by the Church. Pope Pius IX condemened the following proposition in the the Syllabus of Errors: ""Good hope at least is to be entertained of the eternal salvation of all those who are not at all in the true Church of Christ"" (17). This condemnation draws from a previous encyclical entitled Quanto Conficiamur.      So the suggestion that there is good reason to hope for the salvation of all men has been condemned by the Church. Balthasar was aware of this and would not have gone so far as to say that we have good reason to hope for the salvation of everyone. To make this assertion is again to affirm what the Church has condemned.      Where does this leave the position of Balthasar? It leaves him with a hope that is based neither in reason nor in revelation. It leaves him with an irrational hope. That is the problem with the position: it is rooted neither in reason nor revelation.      In the Tradition, the overwhelming weight of the Church Fathers is against the positions of Gregory of Nyssa and Origen and a couple of clever theologians do not overturn the weight of a broad range of Church Fathers that includes a great number of doctors of the Church.      It certainly doesn't overturn the words of Christ that ""the way is narrow and *few will find it*"" (Mt. 7:14). These words are not taken seriously by those in the Balthasar camp. Balthasar's position on this issue was influenced by the reformed theologian Karl Barth. Such theologians have an account of election that has little place for human freedom and secondary causality. They read salvation as though God will save us without us. This is not the Catholic position. The Catholic position is that we need to cooperate with God's grace to be saved.      So, the Balthasarian position in order to remain orthodox on this point would have to posit that we should hope that everyone in history has, is, and will cooperate with God's grace. Well, we might ask the disciples of Balthasar, what reason do we have for thinking that everyone in the world has, is, and will cooperate with God's grace? Oh, you don't have a good reason to think that? Well why in the world would I hold a position that has no rational basis and is widely rejected by the Church Fathers? Why would I hold a position that is so manifestly contrary to the state of our corrupt society?

4098,"""How certain are you of that? If you are to any degree less than certain of that claim, then the door is open for as much religious certainty as a claimant says. If not, then I think you bear the burden to explain.""      Irreflectively, I think I am not 100% certain about that. But if I reflect enough on the matter, I think I might be able to reach 100% certainty - in that case, what could you respond?      Nevertheless, as of now, I admit that I am not 100% certain of it. So what? Although Cartesian doubt is possible for me on that point, it still strikes me as obvious that no one can have absolute certainty of their own religious tradition. It is crazy to think one can be as sure of ""Catholicism is true"" as one can be of ""2 + 2 = 4"". My lack of certainty about that is not a ""gotcha"". There is nothing inconsistent with holding (without absolute certainty) that there can be no absolute certainty about the truth of an entire religion.      (Notice, also, that I am not claiming there can be no absolute certainty of anything. As a matter of fact I am an infallibilist and I think we can know some things with perfect Cartesian certainty, and infallibly so. But the amount of things we can be truly certain of is very small. The first principles for example, like Non-Contradiction.)      So, so what if I am not absolutely certain? I still think it's crazy to suggest you can be absolutely certain that the Catholic Church is the one true church founded by Christ (who by the way was really raised from the dead, and by God, not by any other occurrence or being) etc. You are not certain of that. You might be VERY confident about it, for whatever reason, but you're not certain of it. And if you say you are, then I think you are confused.      ""A personal revelation is just that—personal. One would not expect others to have the same insight without a similar revelation. The fact that my certainty cannot convince you doesn’t mean that I am any less certain.""      Sure. I just think you are entirely confused - much like an atheist who says he is certain that the Christian God doesn't exist - and won't buy it. It's absurd to suggest a contingent fact (such as the truth of Catholicism, if it is true) dependent on so many other historically contingent facts, etc., could be the kind of thing a human being could be certain of. And if I had a ""personal revelation"" about it, I could still question whether I was hallucinating, jumping to conclusions, or whatever - even if I am nevertheless convinced of the revelation! - because it still wouldn't be anything like knowing that contradictions are impossible, that A = A or whatever.      It also doesn't reflect the reality of religious belief in life. Ordinary believers are not certain of what they believe - except if they say so in a vulgar and irreflective manner. They can be very strongly convinced and pious. But they also struggle with doubts from time to time, and are capable of wondering whether it really is true (even if they believe), and so on.

2676,"Quoting Hart:    _For God, deliberative liberty – any “could have been otherwise,” any arbitrary decision among opposed possibilities – would be an impossible defect of his freedom._   And:    _A God who merely chooses to create – as one equally possible exercise of deliberative will among others – is either actualizing a potential beyond his nature... or he is actualizing some otherwise unrealized potential within himself...._      I notice that Hart is essentially stating the Modal Collapse objection in these passages, which purports to find a dilemma according to which either creation must be as actual as God Himself, or His act of creation must be utterly arbitrary, random, and unintended on His part.      Rather than rejecting this dilemma as classical theists do, or taking it as an argument against the Unmoved Mover as atheistic proponents of the argument do, Hart affirms the first leg of the dilemma, collapsing creation into necessity and thus crossing into pantheism. He wants to arbitrarily take this only halfway, though, rather than following that line of logic to its full implication that change and multiplicity are illusions, and only Being Itself exists, a la Parmenides.      As Ed points out, to assume that creation must be as necessary as God in order to be caused by God ignores the distinction between active potency and passive potency. And that distinction isn't some special pleading, but rather a direct implication of the Unmoved Mover argument.      I would argue that the idea that creation must be either necessary or random also evinces a tendency especially common among moderns to try to collapse free will (the choices of rational agents with will and intellect) into either blind law-like automation or random chance, the two broad categories of mindless, mechanistic causation allowed by the ""scientific"" reductionist- mechanistic worldview. _Even though we experience it all the time in our own choices_ , they simply have a difficult time understanding that a free rational agent can cause things such that they are not necessitated by the agent's nature but are still grounded in it and non-random, and that this does not reduce to something less.",quoting hart god deliberative liberty – “ could otherwise ” arbitrary decision among opposed possibility – would impossible defect freedom god merely chooses create – one equally possible exercise deliberative among others – either actualizing potential beyond nature actualizing otherwise unrealized potential within notice hart essentially stating modal collapse objection passage purport find dilemma according either creation must actual god act creation must utterly arbitrary random unintended part rather rejecting dilemma classical theist taking argument unmoved mover atheistic proponent argument hart affirms first leg dilemma collapsing creation necessity thus crossing pantheism want arbitrarily take halfway though rather following line logic full implication change multiplicity illusion exists la parmenides ed point assume creation must necessary god order caused god ignores distinction active potency passive potency distinction special pleading rather direct implication unmoved mover argument would argue idea creation must either necessary random also evinces tendency especially common among modern try collapse free choice rational agent intellect either blind law-like automation random chance two broad category mindless mechanistic causation allowed scientific reductionist- mechanistic worldview even though experience time choice simply difficult time understanding free rational agent cause thing necessitated nature still grounded non-random reduce something le,feser,2200,0
3359,"I have a bone to pick with the reasoning given here:      _And again, “we ought, in this kind of judgment, to aim at judging a man good, unless there is evident proof of the contrary.” To be sure, we might frequently be misled as a result. However, argues Aquinas, this is preferable to the outcome that would follow if we did not give others a presumption of innocence:       **He who interprets doubtful matters for the best, may happen to be deceived more often than not; yet it is better to err frequently through thinking well of a wicked man, than to err less frequently through having an evil opinion of a good man, because in the latter case an injury is inflicted, but not in the former.**_      I suggest: _On the contrary:      “Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. (Matt 5:13      …and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame. (1 Peter 3:16)      If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. (1 Peter 4:14)      No weapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every tongue that accuses you.   This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and this is their vindication from me,” declares the Lord. (Isaiah 54:17)      For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me,   speaking against me with lying tongues. (Ps. 109:2)   But thou, O God my Lord,   deal on my behalf for thy name's sake;   because thy steadfast love is good, deliver me! (Ps. 109:21)   Help me. O Lord my God!   Save me according to thy steadfast love!   Let them know that this is thy hand;   thou, O lord, hast done it!   let them curse, but do thou bless! (Ps. 109:26-28) _      So, arguably, the mere _thought <.i> against a man is not injury to him.      I don't think it is easy to establish the last statement in ""in the latter case, an injury is inflicted, but not in the former."" Let me suggest the opposite: As often as you injure an innocent man when you judge him evil, just as often so also you injure _yourself or others_ when you judge an evil man to be innocent.      To argue this: Let me distinguish: if you judge a man evil when he isn't, but you do not ACT on this opinion in any way, you do not _actually_ injure the man as such. **YOUR** thoughts don’t affect him directly, but only via some further medium. So, the only actual injury he suffers is when you ACT on that opinion. Now, perhaps the first action you might take is to declare your judgment to others and this WOULD be harm to him (in some sense or other, perhaps), but let's eliminate this: it clearly requires not your mere judgment, but your ACT to tell others. The next most likely downstream (harmful) event from that erroneous judgment is that you won't give him some trust on some matter, and this withholding from trust does actually injure him. Any actual harm requires a transfer from your _thought_ into some secondary vehicle that goes outside yourself and impinges on him. UNTIL you have an occasion (such as this withholding trust) to act on your erroneous opinion, you have not actually injured him. However, there are high prospects that there WILL be some such occasion, and so it is _very likely_ that you will injure him. And perhaps this high likelihood is sufficient to say (as a loose approximation) that you ""have"" harmed him in making the judgment. _",bone pick reasoning given “ ought kind judgment aim judging man good unless evident proof contrary ” sure might frequently misled result however argues aquinas preferable outcome would follow give others presumption innocence interprets doubtful matter best may happen deceived often yet better err frequently thinking well wicked man err le frequently evil opinion good man latter case injury inflicted former suggest contrary “ blessed people insult persecute falsely say kind evil matt …and keep good conscience thing slandered revile good behavior christ put shame peter reviled name christ blessed spirit glory god rest peter weapon forged prevail refute every tongue accuses heritage servant lord vindication ” declares lord isaiah wicked deceitful mouth opened speaking lying tongue p thou god lord deal behalf thy sake thy steadfast love good deliver p help lord god save according thy steadfast love let know thy hand thou lord hast done let curse thou bless p - arguably mere thought man injury think easy establish last statement latter case injury inflicted former let suggest opposite often injure innocent man judge evil often also injure others judge evil man innocent argue let distinguish judge man evil act opinion way actually injure man thought affect directly via medium actual injury suffers act opinion perhaps first action might take declare judgment others would harm sense perhaps eliminate clearly requires mere judgment act tell others next likely downstream harmful event erroneous judgment give trust matter withholding trust actually injure actual harm requires transfer thought secondary vehicle go outside impinges occasion withholding trust act erroneous opinion actually injured however high prospect occasion likely injure perhaps high likelihood sufficient say loose approximation harmed making judgment,feser,3511,0

The logic formula “p and (q or r) = (p and q) or (p and r)” is always valid only in a realm where Boolean logic is always valid, e.g., Newtonian physics. Aristotelian logic is a generalization of that Logic, hence the reality’s structure (included the quantum’s one) it describes has not always abide to that.   (2) As physicist we must not forget that QM as well its subsequent application in particle physics is a “just” a narrative which works (well, at least it is what Copenhagen’s school teaches us). As philosophers, we must give a hermeneutic, or if you prefer, a frame of interpretation for this narrative. Now, philosophically, we do not need a big bunch of new conceptual tools to describe what kind of categories of entities this narrative can be referred to: the Aristotelian one set is more than sufficient, not only at the level of the logic involved but also at the level of the concepts. We are surrounded by realities which are not individualized, not only quarks, electrons and fields of any kind, but also colors, warmth, affection, knowledge. We are also surrounded by beings which need to be “connected” to a bigger whole to exist as such, not only quarks, protons and electrons, atoms and crystals, but also limbs and bodies, leaves and trees, and so on and so forth. As philosophers we must understand that reasoning on a “free” electron is the same as reasoning about a “free” color which would wander by itself, about qualities and accidents: it will follow some rules of the logic and we can even affirm what happens when the yellow color “meets” an orange when this one fruit is ripe. Equations of movement “just” tell us what happens once one of these qualities meets the substance which will allow it to transition (projection in a Hilbert’s space) into something measurable, i.e., something actual, e.g., an “explosion” of any kind of particles (?) or, more precisely analogic and digital electronic signals, in the ATLAS instrumentation at CERN which confirms, or not, the … narrative.

Thus a hydrogen atom has a smaller mass than the sum of the masses of a free electron and a free proton. This lost mass in the hydrogen atom is called the ""binding energy"" of the electron and the proton in the hydrogen atom.

3139,"WCB,      It's an uncontroversial, well-acknowledged fact of intellectual history that ""critical theory"" is a tradition of thought that emerged out of Marxism and was pioneered by self-avowed Marxists. What else could CRT be invoking with ""Critical"" in the very name but that tradition?      From the Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's page on ""Critical Theory"":      ""According to these theorists, a 'critical' theory may be distinguished from a 'traditional' theory according to a specific practical purpose: a theory is critical to the extent that it seeks human 'emancipation from slavery', acts as a 'liberating … influence', and works 'to create a world which satisfies the needs and powers of' human beings (Horkheimer 1972b [1992, 246]). Because such theories aim to explain and transform all the circumstances that enslave human beings, many 'critical theories in the broader sense have been developed. They have emerged in connection with the many social movements that identify varied dimensions of the domination of human beings in modern societies.      ...While Critical Theory is often thought of narrowly as referring to the Frankfurt School that begins with Horkheimer and Adorno and stretches to Marcuse and Habermas, any philosophical approach with similar practical aims could be called a 'critical theory,' including feminism, critical race theory, and some forms of post-colonial criticism."" (Bohman, 2021, paras. 1-2)      That's what rightwing critics mean when they call CRT ""Marxist"":      ""The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it."" ``-- Karl Marx, Theses on Feuerbach      But go ahead and project onto me and other conservatives that we have been hoodwinked by Fox News and Chris Rufo as you regurgitate the distortions and talking points from leftwing media and activists about this most pernicious of ideologies animating the contemporary left.",wcb uncontroversial well-acknowledged fact intellectual history critical theory tradition thought emerged marxism pioneered self-avowed marxist else could crt invoking critical name tradition standford encyclopedia page critical theory according theorist critical theory may distinguished traditional theory according specific practical purpose theory critical extent seek human emancipation act liberating … work create world satisfies need power human being horkheimer b theory aim explain transform circumstance enslave human being many critical theory broader sense developed emerged connection many social movement identify varied dimension domination human being modern society critical theory often thought narrowly referring frankfurt school begin horkheimer adorno stretch marcuse habermas philosophical approach similar practical aim could called critical theory including feminism critical race theory form post-colonial criticism bohman para - rightwing critic mean call crt marxist philosopher interpreted world various way point change -- karl marx thesis feuerbach go ahead project onto conservative hoodwinked fox news chris rufo regurgitate distortion talking point leftwing medium activist pernicious ideology animating contemporary left,feser,1931,0
3979,"As usual, Professor, this is well done. However, I would ask you to make a clarification of an ambiguity that arises in 2 places in your post:      _The ordinary magisterium of the Church, and the pope when exercising it, are also infallible when they simply reiterate some doctrine that has been consistently taught for centuries...      as I have already acknowledged, a pope’s exercise of the ordinary magisterium can also be infallible when it involves reiterating doctrines consistently taught by the Church for centuries. _      These comments are similar but in part deficient in clarity when compared to another comment:      _Now, as already noted, the standard qualification would be that popes can err when neither speaking ex cathedra nor, in their ordinary magisterium, merely reiterating teaching already independently known to be infallible._      The issue I have is in that more precision is needed in speaking of the pope's ""ordinary magisterium"" and how it bears on infallibility.      First, I would suggest that it is probably a mistake to even use a phrase like ""the pope's magisterium"" at all. Not that the phrase is wrong altogether, but I think it creates a connotation that is unhappy: the **Church** has the teaching office as a whole, and the bishops _exercise_ that teaching office in a special way their fullness of the priestly orders. The bishops (including the popes) exercise the teaching office _in an ordinary way_ when they teach. The bishops exercise the teaching office _in an extraordinary way_ when they teach by solemn definition in ecumenical council. The pope, acting distinctly from the college of bishops, exercises the magisterial office in an extraordinary way when he solemnly defines a truth to be held by the universal Church.      And the bishops, _not executing their office as teacher in an extraordinary way_ also generate an infallible teaching when they teach _in an ordinary way_ some truth as _to be held_ , where there is universal agreement on this teaching by the college of bishops. In this latter case, the infallibility is the effect, not of bishops acting in an extraordinary act of solemn pronouncement, but of the Holy Spirit bringing about effective universality and unanimity to the separate teaching acts of the bishops exercising their teaching office in an ordinary way.",usual professor well done however would ask make clarification ambiguity arises place post ordinary magisterium church pope exercising also infallible simply reiterate doctrine consistently taught century already acknowledged exercise ordinary magisterium also infallible involves reiterating doctrine consistently taught church century comment similar part deficient clarity compared another comment already noted standard qualification would pope err neither speaking ex cathedra ordinary magisterium merely reiterating teaching already independently known infallible issue precision needed speaking ordinary magisterium bear infallibility first would suggest probably mistake even use phrase like magisterium phrase wrong altogether think creates connotation unhappy church teaching office whole bishop exercise teaching office special way fullness priestly order bishop including pope exercise teaching office ordinary way teach bishop exercise teaching office extraordinary way teach solemn definition ecumenical council pope acting distinctly college bishop exercise magisterial office extraordinary way solemnly defines truth held universal church bishop executing office teacher extraordinary way also generate infallible teaching teach ordinary way truth held universal agreement teaching college bishop latter case infallibility effect bishop acting extraordinary act solemn pronouncement holy spirit bringing effective universality unanimity separate teaching act bishop exercising teaching office ordinary way,feser,2343,0

574,"@Talmid: My condition for the “necessary” is ‘in order to achieve God’s plan’. We can of course only see that very dimly indeed, but it’s clear that the “new heaven and earth” will be more like the creation that people who reject God because of theodicy issues would expect of a good God. No more working in vain, no more pain of witnessing your children's misfortune. The wolf and the lamb eat together, even the lion no longer eats other creatures. So it seems clear to me from revelation that these things are a necessary phase of creation. When God creates he says it’s “good”, even though He knew it would contain elements that would not be part of the second creation. Once we were consciously able to choose between Him and not-Him, we often chose the latter. However it’s in making this choice correctly when it’s not obvious or easy that we ‘grow up’, as in we become as our Father intended.      Now I agree with you that we can imagine universes where we would be free and where we could easily see what is right, where there is no suffering of us or others to make us ‘loose heart’, and where there are no bright and shiny false lights with temporary excitement and pleasure. However, like the vines planted in good, loamy soil, which produce great big bunches of grapes but poor wine, there is clearly a need for us to struggle a bit in an apparently sub optimal environment for the creation process to have a successful end point. How God knows that, we cannot know. Did He tune creation like a quantum experiment, with all possible realities happening, and from eternity selected the one that worked best? Or did He just know, because He is infinite and absolute in all things? I suspect the latter, but the point is that we see a very small part of the creation process. The people who have the most issue with it nearly always think the process is complete, and that is their downfall.",talmid condition “ necessary ” ‘ order achieve course see dimly indeed clear “ new heaven earth ” like creation people reject god theodicy issue would expect good god working vain pain witnessing misfortune wolf lamb eat together even lion longer eats creature seems clear revelation thing necessary phase creation god creates say “ good ” even though knew would contain element would part second creation consciously able choose not-him often chose latter however making choice correctly obvious easy ‘ grow become father intended agree imagine universe would free could easily see right suffering u others make u ‘ loose bright shiny false light temporary excitement pleasure however like vine planted good loamy soil produce great big bunch grape poor wine clearly need u struggle bit apparently sub optimal environment creation process successful end point god know know tune creation like quantum experiment possible reality happening eternity selected one worked best know infinite absolute thing suspect latter point see small part creation process people issue nearly always think process complete downfall,feser,1902,0
1030,"There are many horrendous evils that a loving father God should prevent/stop, and should be able to. For example, many cases of horrendous suffering caused by some diseases; sexual abuse and torture; etc. The list could go on and on. And Christians do believe that God does, in fact, sometimes prevent or stop said evils through (for example) miracles or providence. So it is a problem why there are still so many of these evils going on and our loving Father does nothing about it - not even when people desperately or earnestly pray and beg him for help.      ""And how could God prevent the evils in the world without also preventing the wonderful goods that accidentally give rise to them or to which by Divine mercy they lead?""      I do not know with certainty that God could do that. But it does seem like there are many cases of seemingly gratuitous, horrible evil - which God should therefore prevent or stop. And again, Christians do believe that God does that in some cases, too (either through miracle or providence). So the problem seems pressing to me.      I believe in God, so in the end I do think that there is some greater good that is achieved with God not-intervening, or allowing this universe to just be full of suffering and horror for some time, etc. I hope there is a morally sufficient reason for it all and that the Form of the Good (God) is not so distant from our love, hopes and needs. But this is a serious epistemic cost - because when I look at the world, it does seem like there are purely gratuitous horrendous evils, or that God should be doing better, and so on. It's a bad epistemic cost, one that I wish I could avoid, and it makes me think that some people truly are reasonable in their position of atheism. I personally just happen to find theism to be harder to deny, rationally speaking, so I think it offsets the problem of evil in the end.

Motion in physics is velocity. Velocity is a vector not a scalar so it is not just dx/dt but dx/dt with a direction. So when a thing changes direction or slows down motion/velocity is **not** conserved....by definition.      Momentum and energy have different definitions. The First Mover argument is about local motion/velocity, not momentum/energy.

For example, I remember for certain what I did yesterday, but still my memory is not infallible; I am quite clear that two and two makes four, but I often make mistakes in long addition sums. I have no doubt whatever that John or Richard is my true friend, but I have before now trusted those who failed me, and I may do so again before I die.’      ‘A certitude is directed to this or that particular proposition; it is not a faculty or gift, but a disposition of mind relatively to a definite case which is before me.

We ought in strict propriety, to speak, not of infallible acts, but of acts of infallibility…’      ‘A man is infallible, whose words are always true; a rule is infallible, if it is unerring in all its possible applications.

I may be certain that the Church is infallible, while I am myself a fallible mortal; otherwise, I cannot be certain that the Supreme Being is infallible, until I am infallible myself. It is a strange objection, then, which is sometimes urged against Catholics, that they cannot prove and assent to the Church's infallibility, unless they first believe in their own. Certitude, as I have said, is directed to one or other definite concrete proposition. I am certain of proposition one, two, three, four, or five, one by one, each by itself. I may be certain of one of them, without being certain of the rest; that I am certain of the first makes it neither likely nor unlikely that I am certain of the second; but were I infallible, then I should be certain, not only of one of them, but of all, and of many more besides, which have never come before me as yet.

It falsely assumes that if we cannot give an answer with something other than x (to use the example) then the question has no meaning.      Edwards just begs the question by assuming that there is no answer when there IS an answer, one that has been proposed again and again by philosophers: that it is necessary for something to exist. Why is there anything at all? Because it's impossible for there not to have been anything at all. That is surely an intelligible answer.      ""why has lost its meaning because it is logically impossible to have an answer.""      It's just false that it is logically impossible to have an answer. The answer is precisely that it is logically impossible for no things to have existed. There is something rather than nothing because it's impossible for therr to have been absolutely nothing; there is something that is necessary, which could not have failed to exist, and this is why there is something. There isn't an answer beyond necessity, but that doesn't make the answer unintelligible and certainly doesn't mean we shouldn't accept it; we explain things with necessity all the time in mathematics, philosophy, etc. Plus, if one didn't accept that then they'd have to accept brute contingent things which is irrational (or at least seen as a heavy cost even for those who don't accept PSR)",another way arriving conclusion question “ everything exist ” meaningless consider ordinarily ask “ x ” assume answer something x case “ anything ” possible find something outside everything explain everything false question patently meaningful - understand asked mystery dealing mystery thing exist would also uncharitable treat meaningless question captivated many best influential philosopher throughout history something rather nothing anywhere close colorless green idea sleep furiously falsely assumes give answer something x use example question meaning edward begs question assuming answer answer one proposed philosopher necessary something exist anything impossible anything surely intelligible answer lost meaning logically impossible answer false logically impossible answer answer precisely logically impossible thing existed something rather nothing impossible therr absolutely nothing something necessary could failed exist something answer beyond necessity make answer unintelligible certainly mean accept explain thing necessity time mathematics philosophy etc plus one accept accept brute contingent thing irrational least seen heavy cost even accept psr,feser,2104,0
3319,"@ Laudator Temporis Acti,      ""It does in math""      Even in math, truth never corresponds with popularity because math depends on the logic under which it is developed and even humans can develop a logic under which what is true in one system is false under another. Under what authority do you ban the rule of inference ""(A is true implies that A is false)""? If every mathematician in the world called such a rule lunacy, that would not be sufficient to ban it. Lunacy is not even a mathematical concept.      This proffered rule of inference is perhaps the logic of some rock. Since everything is false under its logic, it wills nothing, hence does nothing of its own will. Conventionally we say a rock does not have a will.      :-)      A lunatic has a logic somewhat damaged (by convention) but still closer to normal. He can will himself (usually) to put food into his mouth and even raid the fridge, and even if his neurons are so destroyed that he can't do that, his body will digest the food under its own degraded logic. Of course he could be dying, but that is to be undergoing a change of state to something that is no longer human (lacking a will).      Mathematics just is not objective, somehow outside of creation. It is what God wants it to be. Furthermore, God is beyond our understanding. If He wants it to be possible to square a circle, he can make it so and we have only human arguments against it using the logic that God willed us to normally have, rather than another.

3767,"SeanJanuary 11, 2023 at 10:31 AM   ""In what way was Aristotle wrong about motion?""   Aristotle was fundamentally wrong in asserting that sublunary motion is in an impeding medium such that a moving object requires a mover to account for its motion.      This fundamental error of Aristotle is repeated by Aquinas in the First Way in the example of the staff and hand, wherein Aquinas asserts that the staff moves ""only"" because it is moved by the hand, which is clearly false.      This fundamental error of Aristotle, repeated by Aquinas, leads to the unsound argument for the first mover.      The truth is that all motion is in space. You are in space. We are all in space. Motion is never lost, only transferred or transformed. An object once set in motion will continue moving ad infinitum unless its motion is transferred or transformed.      Aristotle had the notion of ad infinitum motion in his grasp, as expressed in his Physics book 4, but he discounted the notion of the void, thinking, among other things, that speed would go to infinity absent the sublunary impeding medium.      Aristotle was not an atomist, and thus had no understanding that heat and temperature are functions of molecular or atomic motion, which progresses losslessly in space, thus negating the argument from motion for a first mover.",seanjanuary way aristotle wrong motion aristotle fundamentally wrong asserting sublunary motion impeding medium moving object requires mover account motion fundamental error aristotle repeated aquinas first way example staff hand wherein aquinas asserts staff move moved hand clearly false fundamental error aristotle repeated aquinas lead unsound argument first mover truth motion space space space motion never lost transferred transformed object set motion continue moving ad infinitum unless motion transferred transformed aristotle notion ad infinitum motion grasp expressed physic book discounted notion void thinking among thing speed would go infinity absent sublunary impeding medium aristotle atomist thus understanding heat temperature function molecular atomic motion progress losslessly space thus negating argument motion first mover,feser,1320,0

1935,"Melkman, you seem to be fusing two different issues: the first is the difference between material heresy and formal heresy. Material heresy is believing X when the Church has taught not-X. You can do this by merely NOT KNOWING that the Church has taught not-X. Formal heresy adds to the material heresy the necessary spiritual ingredient of holding the proposition X obstinately, in the face of the Church's teaching, being aware _that the Church teaches not-X_. This is the sin of heresy in its formal aspect.      Then there is another distinction, having the sin of heresy, versus the ecclesiastical crime of heresy. If you obstinately hold X, but _never tell or act on that belief_ , you could not be held guilty in a Church court for the ecclesiastical crime, because there would be no knowledge of the fact. So your heresy could become publicly declared. So it would not be ""formally"" determined heresy, by which you mean "" **officially** NAMED 'the sin of heresy' by the Church"".      And then there is the distinction between holding an X where the Church has taught not-X, but in which not-X is _not a formally defined dogma to be affirmed with Catholic faith, or a definitive teaching ""to be held"" unreservedly_ but a lesser position, taught (""merely"") as a firm tradition. While a Church court might find you guilty of some crime or other in publicly asserting X, it wouldn't necessarily be that of ""heresy"" as defined in the canons. For the latter, the teaching of not-X must be a definitive one, a teaching on which the Church has **definitively** resolved the debate. So, you could be found obstinately sinful in holding error, but not that of "" **formally defined** "" error.      Your point seems to be that even if the position stated by Honorius was actually material heresy, (a) maybe he wasn't guilty of the obstinacy necessary for the sin, and (b) nobody in the Church could have successfully carried out an ecclesiastical trial to _determine_ his guilty status so that it could be OFFICIALLY DECLARED to be ""heresy"" to all. erick below points out the additional issue that the true answer had not yet been defined.      To all of this, I will submit: the point of this post is not to answer whether a pope might be _officially declared_ a heretic, or whether a pope might hold a position that had already been _officially defined_ to be wrong, but to discuss whether a pope might ever hold (and teach) what is, materially, erroneous, on faith and morals; and do so when he _should have known better_ even if the Church had not yet officially defined the issue.",melkman seem fusing two different issue first difference material heresy formal heresy material heresy believing x church taught not-x merely knowing church taught not-x formal heresy add material heresy necessary spiritual ingredient holding proposition x obstinately face teaching aware church teach not-x sin heresy formal aspect another distinction sin heresy versus ecclesiastical crime heresy obstinately hold x never tell act belief could held guilty church court ecclesiastical crime would knowledge fact heresy could become publicly declared would formally determined heresy mean officially named sin church distinction holding x church taught not-x not-x formally defined dogma affirmed catholic faith definitive teaching held unreservedly lesser position taught merely firm tradition church court might find guilty crime publicly asserting x necessarily heresy defined canon latter teaching not-x must definitive one teaching church definitively resolved debate could found obstinately sinful holding error formally defined error point seems even position stated honorius actually material heresy maybe guilty obstinacy necessary sin b nobody church could successfully carried ecclesiastical trial determine guilty status could officially declared heresy erick point additional issue true answer yet defined submit point post answer whether pope might officially declared heretic whether pope might hold position already officially defined wrong discus whether pope might ever hold teach materially erroneous faith moral known better even church yet officially defined issue,feser,2581,0

3360,"@Uncommon Descent      I don't think you have understood the account of charity given in this post. Charity or love is to will the good of another person. This is the highest call of the Christian and a fulfilment of the entire law. We are called to love God above all things and to love our neighbor as ourselves. It is in this that Christians reflect the image of God who is love itself. It is in this that we show the Spirit of love dwelling within us as ""the love of God is poured into [our] hearts through the Holy Spirit who is given to us"" (Rom 5:5). It is this love that causes us to obey Christ's commands as Jesus taught ""If you love me you will keep my commands"" (John 14:15). The significance of this love for our salvation is that ""Christ is the source of eternal salvation for those who obey Him"" Hebrews 5:9).      This love is even greater than faith (1 Cor 13). Even with faith to move mountains, without love we are nothing (1 Cor 13). It is this love that causes our faith to work as what counts is ""faith working through love"" (Gal 5:6).      Again, this is the entire law: to love God and to love neighbor as oneself. Such love is reflected in the 10 commandments with the first 3 being about loving God and the second 7 being about loving neighbor. It is for this reason that Jesus responded to the rich young ruler's question (""what must I do to be saved?"") by quoting the commandments and then calling him to an act of love for the poor. It is for this reason that Jesus will separate the sheep and the goats based on whether or not they cared for those without clothes, food, and those imprisoned. We will be judged in the end on whether or not love dwells within us. As God is love itself and this love it poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, it is this love by which we ""remain in Christ"" as branches remain in the vine. This occurs when we love even our enemies as Christ calls us to do.      This does not mean that we never correct our enemies or rebuke them. Rebuking a sinner to stop sinning is an act of love. It is a work of mercy. So is instructing those that are ignorant. The key point in the post above is that we should not easily default into thinking that those who disagree with us are malicious.

It is ""up to you"" whether you believe in fairies and goblins. You are ""free"" to believe in fairies and goblins, but that does not make such a belief rooted in Scripture or Tradition. Nor does it make it reasonable. And choices that are rooted neither in reason nor revelation are baseless. Such ""freedom"" is really no freedom at all. It is a sheer willfulness to believe whatever I want to believe regardless of reason, evidence, and revelation. That is the point. Authentic freedom is always rooted in reason and/or revelation. In other words, authentic freedom is always rooted in the truth. If I have neither reason nor revelation to support my belief in fairies, then it is unreasonable to do so. If you wish to believe in fairies because they give you warm fuzzy feelings, you are ""free"" to do so, but that does not make your choice a good choice. It makes it baseless just as your choice to believe that everyone may be going to heaven is baseless.      This leads to the biggest problem with the position: counterfactuals.

However, if one's ""interpretation"" involves denying or ignoring the testimony of Scripture, then this is not really an interpreation so much as a denial of the explicit teaching of Sripture. So if Scripture teaches that the way to eternal life is narrow and few will find it and I say it is broad and everyone will (or might find), then I am denying revelation. Who will or will not be saved is not something you or I could know apart from revelation. However, it is something that God knows and He has revealed to us that ""few will find it"".

I don't see how that gets out of Aquinas's arguments though. You basically asserted that God wouldn't depend on his attributes coming together to form a whole. That's an assertion. The problem is that if the attributes are in fact distinct from God, then they are not God - they are not the divine essence. But then where do these distinct attributes come from? Since they are distinct from the divine essence, they cannot exist a se (otherwise they would be another instance of necessary existence/pure esse which is what the Divine Essence is). But then they will be caused by God (which would be impossible and/or superfluous, because it would be a case of a cause actualizing itself), and would in some manner actualize God (which would be impossible, etc).

His question seemed vague, especially since it referred at the end to ""the status as moral teaching of the counsel"" where what ""the"" counsel means is not specified; in Christian terms ""counsel"" refers usually to the fruit of of the cardinal virtue of prudence, not to the magisterial councils of the Church.

From the beginning, contrary to what Ed claims, suffering was a problem and hence, from the beginning, there was a a need for theodicies.   God may be good in only an analogous way, but an analogy has something in common with what it is compared to, and your definition of goodness is contrary to what is generally understood by goodness. What is more important is that I think you are a good person and that in everyday life you use the same definition of goodness that I do.   And on that definition of goodness, every possibilty of evil would be ruled out if that were possible. But yiurb definition of god's goodness is simply circular ""Good is what God does and whatever god does is good"".      It is indeed so that the Christian good is not all good in any meaningful sense, not just not in the sense that we are but in no sense at all.   Using people and their suffering as a means to get a more attractive creation is not good in any meaningful sense. It is, in every meaingful sense, appalling.

1919,"A helpful and informative discussion. I will break up my reflection in multiple posts, since what I have to say is too long for a single comment.      One point I see consistently unmentioned in various assessments of Honorius I have read online over the years, though, is the importance of the distinction between formal and material heresy. I do not know when this distinction came to be (ahem) formally recognized in Catholic thought, but I suspect it was after the period of Honorius.      What is significant in this in respect to the later Vatican I's declaration of papal primacy of jurisdiction is that the Pope himself is the final court of appeal. Hence, in many cases someone might not be aware of their heresy, and hold it materially but not formally (insofar as they are not consciously and obstinately asserting a view contrary to the teaching of the Church, as made clear to them by the ecclesial authorities). In other words, it is ultimately up the ecclesial authorities, and ultimately via appeal to the Pope himself, to declare a view heretical.      It seems that it is only at that point that one who continues to hold the problematic view can be definitively called a formal heretic (such would apply earlier, of course, if the person himself acknowledged his view was heretical, but said he did not care, etc.). But in the case of one who does not consider his view heretical, it would require ecclesial judgment, and even this could be overridden by the Pope via appeal. That would be the final say, at least in that Pope's lifetime (another wrinkle in the case of Honorius, on which i'll comment more in a moment).

2951,"Vincent, I fear your new theory is just the same as the Aristotelian thesis but in different words. You still have levels of being and now some actualities are grounded in other “actualities.” Form is the source of a things defined properties, matter is the source of its ability to have other properties. If you scrap matter for just another kind of form then you have a Parmenedian static universe. If this conclusion doesn’t follow from your new conception of “levels of actuality” then you’re really just describing potency.      Potency is not mysterious, it’s almost the exact same meaning as when average men say something has “potential.” And I highly disagree that essence and existence are artificial.      The ancients like Plato and Aristotle were much better at being in touch with intuitive knowledge and deepening their understanding of what is already implicit in our mind (I.e. growing of wisdom) rather than the contemporary philosophical practice of over-analyzing to the point of doubting the obvious. The contemporary philosopher is rigorously trained to over-analyze and cut himself off from the original source of information (e.g.Descartes, Kant, pansyschism, etc.), so I caution against the accusation that Plato, Aristotle, or Aquinas were mysterious or artificial in their thinking when it is probably us who are blind.

3758,"Hey @Rafa,      I'm Brazilian too so I think I can help you with this. First, I must say that Aristotelian-Thomistic metaphysics (A-T for short now on) is well-developed and could be hard to understand at first (and indeed, it could take a long time to get a lot of it right) but Ed's turn makes all of that intelligible and very readable for lay people like us. Second, if you grow up like me (I'm from around Sampa, btw) and had that *amazing* educational system regarding philosophy and related matters, I friendly suggest that you get rid of all of these crap notions that you could have learned about the soul, religion and etc. because this will effectively hinder your knowledge - and you will be reading into A-T metaphysics something that's not true of it!      For a start, I do recommend the famous The Last Superstition (TLS, for short), but I urge you to not buy the Portuguese version (even though the cover art is awesome), but instead, you should buy the yellow cape OG version. I know it may sound paradoxical, but you will understand the English version much better than the Portuguese one because our Portuguese version looks like the people who translated it have a superficial understanding of the doctrine and even less knew Ed's amazing style of writing a book (i.e the Portuguese version is a pedantic, hard to read and misleading just like the great majority of continental philosophy books that we are familiar with). I don't know if you share that opinion about our philosophical school (continental) but I can say without thinking twice that I only could grasp things truly when I read the original version. So keep that in mind.      I do recommend though that you read the book calmly, and carefully and not read your own understanding into the book itself. And when you get a better familiarity with A-T (through the monumental, careful, and well-detailed blog posts that Ed wrote throughout all these years and the TLS itself) I do recommend, with some cautions, Scholastic Metaphysics: A contemporary introduction. The caution part is because, even though Ed's incomparable ability to make it readable through and through you gonna face some things - to say the truth a lot of it - that we are unfamiliar with because of our traditional philosophical school (e.g causal powers, dispositions, modality, essence and existence, identity over time in some sense, and others).      If you want to know more about Our Father, I do recommend you to read the wonderful Five Proofs for the existence of God. In this book, Ed goes through five philosophical arguments given for the existence of God. In special, it would be nice if you already have some familiarity with the Act/Potency distinction - even though Ed goes through to explain it in the book - because if you grasp that distinction, you will see why the Aristotelian Proof further developed by Saint Thomas must necessarily follow from the philosophical premises of the argument. You don't need faith to know that God does exist, but after knowing that His existence sure follows and that for some reason does not change your faith... I dare to say that you don't understand the argument right.      And, of course, there are A LOT of good-willed fellows out here in the blog (e.g Michael Copas, grodriges, Mister Geocon, UncommonDescent, and my homeboy Talmid just to say a few ones that I remember).

2597,"Isn't that what affirmative action effectively already does to some extent, which, incidentally, is on the chopping block? Except here, no rich people need to shave any money off their bank accounts. And hasn't it failed? And wasn't it just a lazy way of pretending to solve what is essentially a cultural problem? (Recent African immigrants, by contrast, do very well, academically and professionally, even after our previous American schools teach them that, despite what their lying eyes tell them, they are, in fact, oppressed, that there's no sense in denying it, and the only way out of the invisible cage is through rage and self-pity.)      But more to the point... By making things concrete, you make them tractable, and when you make them tractable, you make it possible to arrive at a goalpost. But who wants that? Once a problem is resolved, careers and institutions built around the problem are threatened because you've taken away their very raison d'etre. They no longer have the cudgel or leverage they once had.      The same is true of feminism. Many feminist demands have been met. But has feminism gone away?

4147,"Hi Ed,      The central problem with the design argument, as you point out, is that in and of itself, it can only take us to a cosmic architect, who could be merely a Demiurge, rather than a Creator. But I put it to you that traditional, cosmological arguments have a problem of their own: all they establish is the existence of an Ultimate Cause, or Necessary Being, which may or may not be personal - i.e. an intelligent moral agent.      Defenders of the traditional arguments typically attempt to rectify this deficiency by arguing that (i) the Ultimate Cause or Necessary Being must be Pure Being itself, (ii) Pure Being is infinite and utterly unlimited, and (iii) anything which is infinite and utterly unlimited must be intelligent and capable of moral agency - not merely as one agent among many, but as the Agent from which other agents derive their ability to act.      The problem with this line of reasoning, as I see it, is that even granting (i) and (ii), (iii) does not follow. Intelligence is not a mode of being; therefore even a perfect and unlimited Being need not be intelligent. Nor does God's intelligence follow from his being the Ultimate Cause, for the cause of X need not possess any knowledge of X. One might try to argue that whatever contains the form of X must somehow know it, but this is dumbing down the definition of knowledge. There is no reason to suppose that the mere ability to produce an object’s form gives the producer a knowledge of that form – even in cases when the producer is an immaterial agent. How do we know that He is acting intentionally, in producing the forms which are instantiated in our universe?      The only solution to this problem, as I see it, is to make the notion of a Personal Agent ontologically fundamental, and attempt to argue that impersonal agents (such as bodies) are, in fact, pale imitations of personal agents: blind rule-followers stripped of any intentionality. John Macmurray defended this approach to God in his Gifford Lectures of 1953-54, later published as ""The Self as Agent"" and ""Persons in Relation.""

But it does bar making white students apologise to black students for transgressions of the past or teaching that the white people of today have innate racism of which they don't know about. This is literally what is being taught in schools, muti national corporations etc. And it's not just white people, any group that has a had any measure of success in the system namely Asians, has been accused of pandering to the so called White Supremacists. If people are banning CRT at the college level is wrong but at the school level, there is really no need to teach children that America's social and economic structures are supposedly inherently designed to prevent the success of minorities. There may be particular people in the system who are acting in a racist way, that's not s failure of the system, rather it's a failure of the people to abide by the system. People are flawed and every once in a while you can encounter a racist jerk but it's inevitable, there's a limit to which you can fine tune recruitment so as to get the ideal employee.

1090,"Hi Ed,      You write:      As Augustine says, there isn’t “any evil [that] happens to the faithful and godly which cannot be turned to profit,” so that, with St. Paul, “we know that all things work together for good to them that love God” (Romans 8:28).      I have to say that Augustine's remark sounds very Pollyanna-ish. There are some evils which can only be described as soul-breaking, rather than soul- making. Three which come to mind are rape, mutilation and torture. These are horrendous sufferings which serve no ""greater good,"" and which can destroy even a good individual's faith, as the following account of the 17th century ""torture in the pit"" illustrates:      https://sspx.org/en/news-events/news/real-life-silences-character      There were priests, many of them good men, who apostasized. What good was served?      You also cite Augustine to support the following claim: ""We cannot achieve happiness in the world to come if we become too attached to the world that is, and suffering is a means of preventing the latter.""      This might explain some of the suffering that befalls adults, but it fails to explain the death and suffering of a child, who has no worldly attachments.      Finally, original sin (or the fall of Adam) is said to be the ultimate explanation for why humans are permitted to suffer and die, rather than enjoying immortality and bliss. I am not persuaded that a dumb choice by a distant ancestor makes it fair for us to be allowed to suffer soul-breaking evils of the sort described above, but let that pass. What original sin cannot explain is the fact that people (e.g. political prisoners, psychiatric patients) have been beaten or tortured to death, while screaming for Divine deliverance or at least some Divine consolation (i.e. a sense of ""I am with you"") at the moment of death, and in many cases, it never arrives: they die in agony and desolation. Spiritual abandonment at the hour of death is the most difficult evil of all to make sense of, and if you can make any sense of it, Ed, you're a better man than I.      For my part, I think it's best to honestly acknowledge that some evil in this world is indeed gratuitous and senseless, and that there are some dark recesses of the human psyche which God Himself cannot reach: He can console us while we're in pain, but not while we're in agony, as that severs the communication channels.

3713,"Tom,   In Newtonian mechanics both momentum and energy are conserved, I did not bother going into those details, as I left it to the reader to understand the relationships between velocity, mass, momentum, and kinetic energy.      ""This is just garbage. If two blobs of putty collide and stick, motion is lost in any inertial reference frame.""   No, and this is the core misconception in the A-T argument for the first mover.      Aristotle, Aquinas, Feser, Tom, and most of the good posters here have this point wrong. This ancient error you all continue to hold is at the heart of your misunderstanding.      The kinetic energy of motion of the two blobs of putty is converted into the kinetic energy of motion of the molecules that make up the blobs of putty, what we call heat.      No motion is lost, in the very real sense that matter/energy is considered, that is, the molecular motion of the constituents of the putty increases by an amount equal to the decrease in linear translational motion the blobs of putty started with, in a manner that conserves material (matter/energy).      More extreme examples are kinetic weapons and meteors from space. The motion of these projectiles is never lost, rather, it is transformed into the molecular motion we sense as heat.      That is true of all objects that appear to the human senses to slow and stop. To our immediate senses the motion seems to be lost, and that apparent loss leads one to argue for a first mover.      But, in truth, motion is never lost, only transformed. Thus, no first mover is called for.      At base causality, to the extent that causality is a valid concept at all, is fundamentally circular, not hierarchical.

Again, pulling cards from a fair deck would be an example. But much of what happens in nature does not amount to a chance set-up in this sense.

As I said in my exchange with Goff, I would say that the problem arises only if we follow Galileo and his early modern successors in holding that color, odor, sound, heat, cold, and other “secondary qualities” do not really exist in matter in the way common sense supposes them to, but instead exist only in the mind (as the qualia of conscious experience) and are projected by us onto external reality. If you take this position, you are stuck with a conception of matter that makes it impossible to regard consciousness as material. The solution, I would say, is simply not to go along with this assumption in the first place, but to return to the Aristotelian-Scholastic view the early moderns reacted against, and which is compatible with the commonsense view of matter.

3579," _Everybody has the right to criticize everything._      This may represent a _legal_ standard, i.e. nobody is to be punished under civil law for criticizing anything he wants to criticize. But it certainly _does not_ represent the Catholic position on behavior by Catholics. To be specific: criticizing officially declared Church dogma _in a manner repudiating even its basic truth_ (rather than, say, criticizing incompleteness or confused phrasing) is expressly NOT ok for just everyone to do. In fact, it is not OK even for a pope with immense prestige. And Catholics should not _think or feel_ that they are free to criticize just anything: to the extent that they DO feel that way, to that extent they fail to have a Catholic faith.      _Whether a criticism is to be taken seriously has nothing to do with the prestige of the author,_      It is fair to point out that a claim by an author should be evaluated _primarily_ on its own merits rather than on the merits of the author as a person. A good man can make a mistake, and a bad man can say something true.      However, all the same, all of us must make choices as to what claims to _even pay attention to_ enough to go through the effort of evaluating them. Nobody can give ALL claims of all commenters equal weight and evaluate ALL of them independently of who said them.

4375,"@Walter. I agree we’re going around in circles. I could use an analogy of a mother shouting at her daughter to get out of the busy road, and of the elder brother feeling empathy for his sister while accepting that the telling off was necessary. However you will take that in a univocal sense where you can’t translate this onto the big picture, or focus on the idea that I’m claiming that suffering is God ‘telling us off’, which is not the point at all.      I don’t claim to understand the whole picture, but there is a beauty in the universe that relies on this balance between the good stuff and the bad stuff, where our overcoming of difficulties are in a way more valuable because of the difficulties. Without decay physical reality would be a disgusting mess, without suffering our bodies could not have evolved. If you see the physical world as everything, and our physical existence as the peak of some very lucky random circumstances over time, as I did as an atheist, then the idea of this physical universe as a phase of an essentially spiritual creation process makes no sense at all. So instead you decide that a good God would instead just create something like angels in a paradise, and not bother with the often messy physical universe and human beings at all. Which seems to me to loose a great deal of richness from existence, for all it’s troubles. Some of the angels seem to have had this view, so at least you’re not alone!

3770,"Tom,   ""You seem to think that logic is some absolute supporting your prejudice""   Logic is a human convention, to which Aristotle was an early and major contributor.   Aquinas clearly valued logic and put a great deal of effort into an attempt at using logic to make a positive case for the necessity of a first mover, and therefore god.      Dr. Feser clearly values logic, so much so that some of his posts are deep dives into very finely specified nuances of logical minutia, which I greatly appreciate. He and I agree on little, but if we can both agree on a common language of logical communication then at least we have a common basis for constructive engagement.      If you do not value logic then there is no logical argument I can make that will even potentially form a basis for mutual understanding between us.      ""All bodies in temporal motion radiate energy as multi polar radiators and lose orbital motion, thus energy, and come to a natural state of rest.""   That is a version of Aristotelian misunderstanding, that when an object loses energy to an impeding medium and comes to a rest its motion is lost, and therefore, it is erroneously considered, given the fact that we observe motion generally, there must be a prime mover to keep it all moving.      The error Aristotle, Aquinas, Feser, you, and most of the good posters here make is that the energy lost from the slowing and stopping object is not lost in total, rather, the energy of motion is is conserved and is merely transferred.      For every object that slows and stops there is an equal energy of motion gained by other objects due to the conservation of energy. You may observe that an object comes to a rest, but what you are failing to realize is that other objects increase in their velocity by an amount equal to the observed loss.      This forms a system of universal perpetual motion, making a first mover unnecessary.      ""Nothing you say demonstrates that, should an orbit be sustained, it could not be by a prime mover. There is no inconsistency.""   The Fist Way is not an argument for consistency.      I can speculate that little angles nudge every particle in the universe along and they are all continuously battling little demons trying to slow them down, but the little angles typically win, and that is consistent with what we observe.      The First Way is an attempt to prove the necessity of a first mover, and in that attempt the First Way fails.      ""It _is_ in an impeding medium.""   No, all motion is in space. You are in space. The medium does not impede motion, rather, neighbors within the medium impede motion of one object by gaining motion for themselves. No net motion is lost.      ""Absent the impeding medium which removes energy from objects in motion, a continuing force would cause the speed to go to infinity. According to special relativity,""   According to special relativity the mass of an object increases as the speed of the accelerated object approaches c. Energy is not lost, it is gained by the object being accelerated , or gained by any other object the accelerated object loses energy to. E=mc^2 is an expression of the conservation of material.

4697," _But he looks around and sees actually good people, people with special abilities and excellence, and he realizes how unworthy he is of Heaven,_      In addition to the replies above, I want to focus on this notion. First, ""special abilities"" **never was** any aspect of being ""qualified"" for heaven. Take, for example, St. Peter. If you examine his behavior in the Gospels and Acts, you find a guy - a mere fisherman - who constantly puts his foot in his mouth, who berates God, and who runs away from a friend in great need. Eventually, he did clean up his act, but - as with all the saints - he attributed this to **favors he was granted out of God's overflowing gifts** , not out of his own merit.      ""and excelllence"". Again the ONLY excellence that technically qualifies is the **love of God** by which you act rightly in all your acts, and this is (again) always due to God's beneficent favor, not our own merit. All we can claim is to have _remained in cooperation_ with said grace, rather than repudiating it. St. Francis said that greater good would be found in a man merely picking a piece of straw out of the road, if done with perfect love of God, than in a great many great sacrifices suffered with imperfect love.      What you are confusing in ""excellences"" is the acts of HEROIC virtues by which the Church _locates and confirms canonized_ saints, with the actual excellence needed, perfect love. But the life of a nun in a contemplative cloister, who spends her entire life _just FOLLOWING THE RULE_ with perfect charity, (and without any call by God to endure situations demanding heroic virtue), has just as much claim on being in heaven as some highly acclaimed saint who performed many wonders and miracles with love of God, or a saint who bore great visible sufferings for love of God. The Church never _expects_ to canonize all those who go to heaven: she uses the test of heroic virtue as an empirical source of _evidence for_ the required love of God, but she does not deny the same love might persist in many who do not demonstrate it VISIBLY in great events.      And if you die in the state of grace but highly imperfect in your love of God, your time in Purgatory will correct that, and you will get to heaven with perfect love of God - just like the acclaimed and cannonized saints.",look around see actually good people people special ability excellence realizes unworthy heaven addition reply want focus notion first special ability never aspect qualified heaven take example st peter examine behavior gospel act find guy - mere fisherman - constantly put foot mouth berates god run away friend great need eventually clean act - saint - attributed favor granted overflowing gift merit excelllence excellence technically qualifies love god act rightly act always due beneficent favor merit claim remained cooperation said grace rather repudiating st francis said greater good would found man merely picking piece straw road done perfect love god great many great sacrifice suffered imperfect love confusing excellence act heroic virtue church locates confirms canonized saint actual excellence needed perfect love life nun contemplative cloister spends entire life following rule perfect charity without call god endure situation demanding heroic virtue much claim heaven highly acclaimed saint performed many wonder miracle love god saint bore great visible suffering love god church never expects canonize go heaven us test heroic virtue empirical source evidence required love god deny love might persist many demonstrate visibly great event die state grace highly imperfect love god time purgatory correct get heaven perfect love god - like acclaimed cannonized saint,feser,2316,0

I'm sorry if the topic/questions that I put on the table were repetitive or lame. Here in Brazil none of my friends really like to talk about that and don't care that much and I can say the same thing about our philosophers - they're a bunch of commies and half-baked intellectuals when it comes to anything that detours from politics that they ''know a lot''. In short, I don't have anyone to talk about that kind of thing. There are a lot of other questions that I can't even find materials to work with (all I have is some of Ed's books and the articles that David Oderberg gives for free on his website, and still there are a lot of things that I just can't understand right because it's hard to grasp). So I just want to say that I appreciate a lot of you guys time and effort - that means a lot to me.      The topic of natural selection and evolution generally opens up a lot of other questions - questions that mere biologists, say, can't answer in principle. The examples that I brought up about counting cells as individuals it's something that was really puzzling me. Of course, as I said I think that's insane. If cells we're conjoined to survive in the first place why do a lot of them have to die every day for the sake of others if the 'plan' was just for the single cell to survive in the first place? Why do we have apoptosis and the like? Or worse, like I said some comments ago replying to Tom, why do the 'true individuals' (the cells) come to form up 'the illusion' of a single individual? It means that the dog we see every day that 'seems' to rely on and works in unity with his own parts as a single thing to chase down the bikers across the street is just an aggregate of individual cells. That's not just disturbing I think that it's evil to think something like that.      As you guys can see I'm not a pro in biology. That's why I rely so much on the ''armchair'' philosophy. I can see that it is problematic to say that cells are individuals but I don't have a 'biological argument' (whatever that means) to affirm that. But the point is what is the motivation behind that 'science guys' to affirm something bizarre as that? That's something we should repeal because a lot of people just buy these ideas without even thinking about it.",hey uncommon hope trip went well endosymbiosis opinion powerful argument favor a-thomism mechanistic evolution like point well elaborated worked really well concept prime matter potentiality hidden btw want thank attention far tom sorry topicquestions put table repetitive lame brazil none friend really like talk care much say thing philosopher - bunch commie half-baked intellectual come anything detour politics know short anyone talk kind thing lot question even find material work book article david oderberg give free website still lot thing understand right hard grasp want say appreciate lot guy time effort - mean lot topic natural selection evolution generally open lot question - question mere biologist say answer principle example brought counting cell individual something really puzzling course said think insane cell conjoined survive first place lot die every day sake others plan single cell survive first place apoptosis like worse like said comment ago replying tom true cell come form single individual mean dog see every day seems rely work unity part single thing chase bikers across street aggregate individual cell disturbing think evil think something like guy see pro biology rely much armchair philosophy see problematic say cell individual biological whatever mean affirm point motivation behind science affirm something bizarre something repeal lot people buy idea without even thinking,feser,2653,0

3799,"Unfortunately, there is no Kindle version for this book, and I will have to wait it to be delivered with Amazon in Switzerland, hence my comments will be comments on (Feser’s) comment which is not the summit of the state of the art to discuss about this topic.   I think it is rather ingenuous to wish to establish hylomorphism as the right paradigm to interpret quantum mechanic without doing the effort to analyze the logical structures that support the Aristotelian, the Newtonian, and the Quantum mechanical world.   There has been a deep void in understanding the World from Illuminism to nowadays: (1) the deep misunderstanding of the nature of space and time on side, which became like a “box” where all bodies are contained, and which paradigm impedes very clever people to understand the meaning of physics at a reality layer; (2) the consequential shrinking of the Aristotelian/Thomistic logic into a poor subset, namely the Boolean logic, by avoiding to take into account the reality of the existence of things (medium term typically) to validate a reasoning; (3) the objective lack of understanding of what a form is, letting platonic idealism invade the field of scientific reflection (typical of the Descartes pretention to find the soul, which is the form of the human body, inside the pineal gland).   Hence there is no wonder that people do not actually understand that general and local theories of relativity are not the physics of a space-time universal box (i.e., how could the universe be a big block of space and time, while neutrinos and photons, in their own reference’s frame exist for zero second in an infinite space, while for each of us all what we experience and even think is in our physical past, etc. etc.); the symmetries that we find (which are actually the expression of the law of physics) are never perfectly realized in the nature (e.g., time cannot be reversed); or when reflecting on quantum mechanics the paradigmatic incapacity to understand that the form of a system, included its potentiality, is not an element of space and time and that it is impossible to decorrelate a potentiality from the objective possible ends of the considered quantum system.   The Newtonian world is an impoverished world which thinks essentially in terms of BArbArA, while science proceeds falsifying reasoning like BOcArdO, and while everyday people actually uses essentially a DArII logical structure, and Quantum Mechanic the similar DArAptI.   What defines univocally a form is the final cause of it, which is typical of the Quantum Approach of measurement: in contrast, reductionism, which is fine for engineering purposes, cannot pretend to define, per construction, the final cause, even though it allows to understand “the how” this last one is made ""reachable"", it cannot trigger per se that one.   The final cause is, at the end, what gives form to the form included the Quantum form within a world which is driven by Aristotelian logic and, all of that, without paradoxes.

In fact, part of the point of Chapman’s book itself was precisely to uphold that authority, and in particular to defend the Council’s teaching on papal infallibility. And yet for all that, Chapman does not shrink from the judgment that the historical facts show that “no Catholic has the right to deny that Honorius was a heretic” (p. 116). The reason he could say this is that the error Honorius was guilty of did not occur in the context of an _ex cathedra_ definition.

4083,"In contrast to this, the realist account see an inextricable link between the formal cause of a thing (which is the species) and the final cause (the pursuit of life via certain acts). In the scholastic dictum agere sequitur esse (to do follows upon to be). So we look at what a thing does and this points back toward what it is (its form). All animals pursue the end of life, but they do so in distinct ways and it is those distinct ways that naturally distinguish the species not some percentage of genetic difference randomly selected by some guy in a lab for no principled reason. After all, people were able to dinstinguish species before the work of Mendel. This does not make the work of Mendel unimportant but it does mean that we need a non nominalistic account of species that is not based on some random overlap of genetic code, but is instead based in principles observable in nature outside the lab. After all, I don't need a geneticist to tell me what a dog is and that it is distinct from a cat. The fact that the classification of species is now the exclusive privelege of geneticists is not an inevitable outworking of some scientific theorem. Instead it results from the imposition of nominalist metaphysics and its account of species onto the whole program.      For those who strictly follow the river forest principle that metaphysics must always follows physics and that the modern sciences are a subset physics (natural philosophy), I would suggest that they pass along this memo to folks like Darwin because he clearly did not receive it. For those in doubt about this, read the work of AC Crombie who was a part of the Pontifical Academy of the Sciences and wrote and magisterial (pardon the irony) three volume work on the modern history of the sciences following his two volume account of the classical and medieval backdrop. In an article summarizing his three volume work, he identifies what he calls various ""styles"" of European scientific thought that are variously influenced by either nominalism or realism.      So, like it or not, metaphysics has influenced the way that the modern sciences have developed and we cannot take on the modern sciences as a metaphysically neutral part of our natural philosophy without it having a potentially negative effect on our metaphysics. Again, those who think that we can are, on this point, naive.      So, a realist metaphysics coupled with scientific facts could approach the origin of the various kinds in order to suggest the relationship between God and the “kinds” or “species” or “forms” of things. This would fit well with the kinds or forms or species as existing in the mind of God as exemplar causes. This entails arguments not just for the existence of the universe in a broad sense, but rather of God as the cause of the kinds or species of things. It seems to me that there is important exploration that is wide open on this point and would, again, involve a partnership between a Thomist and a scientifically informed ID theorist.",contrast realist account see inextricable link formal cause thing specie final cause pursuit life via certain act scholastic dictum agere sequitur esse follows upon look thing point back toward form animal pursue end life distinct way distinct way naturally distinguish specie percentage genetic difference randomly selected guy lab principled reason people able dinstinguish specie work mendel make work mendel unimportant mean need non nominalistic account specie based random overlap genetic code instead based principle observable nature outside lab need geneticist tell dog distinct cat fact classification specie exclusive privelege geneticist inevitable outworking scientific theorem instead result imposition nominalist metaphysics account specie onto whole program strictly follow river forest principle metaphysics must always follows physic modern science subset physic natural philosophy would suggest pas along memo folk like darwin clearly receive doubt read work ac crombie part pontifical academy science wrote magisterial pardon irony three volume work modern history science following two volume account classical medieval backdrop article summarizing three volume work identifies call various style european scientific thought variously influenced either nominalism realism like metaphysics influenced way modern science developed take modern science metaphysically neutral part natural philosophy without potentially negative effect metaphysics think point naive realist metaphysics coupled scientific fact could approach origin various kind order suggest relationship god “ kind ” “ specie ” “ form ” thing would fit well kind form specie existing mind god exemplar cause entail argument existence universe broad sense rather god cause kind specie thing seems important exploration wide open point would involve partnership thomist scientifically informed id theorist,feser,3019,0

125,"@Alex I think an important nuance here is that in this specific view of participation, goodness-by-participation isn't actually **true or intrinsic** goodness. But this is problematic because we do have other verses affirming the true goodness of creatures, such as Genesis 1 explicitly affirms this, as does 1 Timothy 4 (first four verses on marriage & food) and Matthew 10 (sparrows).      The main problem would be that this view of participationism _wouldn't just make it impossible_ to take pride or ""brag"" about something we did (which I can concede is wrong), but that it also makes it impossible to actually say we are good or have value as well. In the **same manner & for the same reasons** we can't take pride in or brag about our actions, we also can't affirm we are **good,** or have being, and this seems to be a big problem with that specific account.      And it's also important to point out that Scripture often uses **hyperbolic negation** or hyperbolic merism - God for example in Jeremiah 7:22 apparently denies He ever commanded the Hebrews to do sacrifice, yet that's not a literal negation but a hyperbolic one to point out that loving God is more important - rhetorically DENYING one thing to point out the greater importance of another, without intending to truly deny the importance of the secondary. Same thing with loving Christ & hating one's parents - intentionally hyperbolic contrasts that actually convey a hierarchy of love, but not pure exclusivity.      So basing a very specific view of participationism (because not all models of participationism would agree that we aren't actually truly good) on a phrase that is likely using intentional rhetorical hyperbole is more speculative than solid.",alex think important nuance specific view participation goodness-by-participation actually true intrinsic goodness problematic verse affirming true goodness creature genesis explicitly affirms timothy first four verse marriage food matthew sparrow main problem would view participationism make impossible take pride brag something concede wrong also make impossible actually say good value well manner reason take pride brag action also affirm good seems big problem specific account also important point scripture often us hyperbolic negation hyperbolic merism - god example jeremiah apparently denies ever commanded hebrew sacrifice yet literal negation hyperbolic one point loving god important - rhetorically denying one thing point greater importance another without intending truly deny importance secondary thing loving christ hating parent - intentionally hyperbolic contrast actually convey hierarchy love pure exclusivity basing specific view participationism model participationism would agree actually truly good phrase likely using intentional rhetorical hyperbole speculative solid,pruss,1731,1

I'll go for this: those microorganismos were substances at first ( _per se subsistens_ ), capable of ""independent"" life and then merged. A new organism (substantial form) emerged (new species). The mitochondria would remain there virtually, until through accidental changes it could no longer re-gain (in a natural manner) its independence, becoming an obligate intracellular organelle. (But maybe it could in a laboratory in presence of human beings with adequate technology).      2 questions for the darwinian: what does the environment in which a mitochondrion lived prior to the fusion had to do with the intracellular environment in which it found itself after the fusion?? If organisms adapt to their niches, the extracellular life of the mitochondrial organism would have had very little in common with the metabolic machinery of the cytoplasm of the host.

3556,"Nice post Prof Feser!   I concur with almost everything.   I do think that Dubia should have been cleared!   However I think that the case for the Latin Mass would do well if it were to be presented without the purpose of ""appeasing traditionalists"" because it tends to create the image of being held to ransome and traditionalists being traditionalists ought to know better then that. Being in the appeasing business of liberals or traditionalists usually doesn't go well. And a case should be evaluated on its merits.   Pope Benedict XVI always referred to the latin mass as one of the treasures of the Church, I think a very strong argument could be formed on the basis of that it self. And ultimately it should not be restricted is my opinion.   There are some criticisms not of the mass it self but with the circumstances surrounding it. Many right wingers try to frame it as a right wing issue when in fact it absolutely is not and many people of even neutral political persuasions love the latin mass and it's beauty.   Attempts by some traditionalists to campaign against Mass in other languages also doesn't help. Lots of efforts were taken in many areas with regards to translations and words in order to remain true to the substance of the Eucharistic celebration. An example being my mother tongue Konkani. Some people prefer to be able to properly understand the meaning of what is being celebrated so that they can focus and concentrate their mind.

3896," _The original spiritual war was between God & Satan and then God created man; and so the spiritual war continues. As man is below the nature of an angel, Satan is enraged to think that humans can be given Divine Life in their souls, an act of God’s pure love and mercy for us. _      According to some authors, Satan's primary outrage was in apprehending that God would unite Himself to _human_ nature (not to an angelic nature) and that a human being would be elevated _above the angels_ in the order of grace. I.E. Mary.      I don't know if they are just speculating on this, or even merely proposing it as one way to explain Satan's rebellion. I suspect that some of the authors who propose it do so out of a conceit in their own hearts: since (in this account) God's foreseen action makes man _special_ : even Satan's sin must be centered on man's special role. I say this because Satan's sin - if right described above - is one of pride, in that he was unwilling to see angels below a mere creature composed of body and soul. But such pride in a being, once you grant that Satan was going to be proud, _needs no intervening object_ about which to be proud, than his OWN being and his relation to God: Satan could be proud by refusing to accept his dependency on God _without_ any further need of considering Satan's relation to other beings. Parsimony of hypothesis does not require us to lever in Satan considering _some third party_ to the matter, in order to find room for pride.",original spiritual war god satan god created man spiritual war continues man nature angel satan enraged think human given divine life soul act pure love mercy u according author primary outrage apprehending god would unite human nature angelic nature human would elevated angel order grace ie mary know speculating even merely proposing one way explain rebellion suspect author propose conceit heart since account foreseen action make man special even sin must centered special role say sin - right described - one pride unwilling see angel mere creature composed body soul pride grant satan going proud need intervening object proud relation god satan could proud refusing accept dependency god without need considering relation being parsimony hypothesis require u lever satan considering third party matter order find room pride,feser,1489,0
2278,"@Talmid      The same way classical theism and contingent knowledge go together. My open theism is based on the openness of the future (I agree with Pruss and many others that foreknowledge of free acts requires eternalism, but I am a presentist, so I reject foreknowledge of free acts). In other words: there is no difference at all in our views of God - I also believe that he must know every true fact. The difference between us is that I do not believe there are any true facts of what we will choose. Only what we choose or have chosen. So there is nothing for God to know there.      How can God ""learn"" what we choose without undergoing intrinsic change? The same way God can learn any contingent facts without undergoing intrinsic change. Classical theists believe God's knowledge of contingents is externalist and involves only Cambridge changes for him. You already have to believe that God's knowledge differs between worlds without that entailing any change in his intrinsic properties. Even with foreknowledge you have to believe that God only knows what you will do IFF God contingently creates you (unless you are a Molinist - which thomists reject - or you believe God creates of necessity). So you're on the same boat as me when it comes to having to account for God's contingent knowledge without real change. The only difference, again, is that I think there is nothing to know re: ""future choices"".      So no, open theism does not entail God being temporal. I wholeheartedly agree that God is outside of time. But unlike what some (very confused) thomists think, that does not mean that God can ""see the future"" as if there were anything to see there (unless, again, you are an eternalist/B theorist).",talmid way classical theism contingent knowledge go together open theism based openness future agree pruss many others foreknowledge free act requires eternalism presentist reject foreknowledge free act word difference view god - also believe must know every true fact difference u believe true fact choose choose chosen nothing god know god learn choose without undergoing intrinsic change way god learn contingent fact without undergoing intrinsic change classical theist believe knowledge contingent externalist involves cambridge change already believe knowledge differs world without entailing change intrinsic property even foreknowledge believe god know iff god contingently creates unless molinist - thomists reject - believe god creates necessity boat come account contingent knowledge without real change difference think nothing know future choice open theism entail god temporal wholeheartedly agree god outside time unlike confused thomists think mean god see future anything see unless eternalistb theorist,feser,1722,0

487,"I am an eternalist. I think it's OK for the accidents of a substance to be located at a time where the substance does not exist. In one sense this isn't, however, a case of the accidents existing without the substance, because when the accidents exist presently, the substance exists, too, albeit pastly.      As for consubstantiation, here are some worries.      1\. When Jesus says ""This is my body"", it seems like he is pointing to the visible thing, namely bread. If there is bread there, then he is pointing at the bread. Thus, if there is bread there, he is making the incorrect or at least non-literal statement that that thing, the bread, is his body. But the Tradition likes to take Jesus's words here literally.      2\. According to Scripture and Tradition, we eat Christ's body and drink his blood. But on a consubstantiation view, it's not clear that this is the right way to describe it. It seems that what we really eat and drink is the co- present bread and wine, and the body and blood just happens to come along with it. Here's my image of consubstantiation. Suppose that magnetic fields are substances. Then where there is a magnet, we have something like consubstantiation: there are two substances, a magnet and a magnetic field, in the same place (I am talking of the magnetic field inside the magnet, not the one that extends outside of it). But suppose now you foolishly eat the magnet (DON'T DO IT; children have died from eating two magnets and having them pinch through intenstines).

I argue that (b) is incompatible with classical theism, and I think everyone involved agrees. Thus, we must assert (a) in the alternative.      But (a) means that creation is inevitable.

He first promulgated the belief that it is the subject (the viewer) that is central to knowledge, and not the object viewed. Socratics believed that truth was a quality that existed outside of human perception. It was a philosopher’s job to search it out. Plato, unwittingly, gave a demonstration of this in his famous parable about shadows in a cave that we have touched on. People are chained to a cave wall and can see only shadows thrown from objects passing before a fire behind them. Since this is all they ever see, they will mistake the shadows for reality. In this example, perception is not the seat of knowledge at all, but instead a false prophet. Truth does not exist in the perception of the person in the cave, but is an independent quality that is outside not only the viewer’s perception, but also outside the cave itself. Jesus took this a step further in describing truth not as a quality, but as a god, as independent from a man’s perception as it is possible to be. Truth was God, and came from God, and it was our job to accept God and His will for us. Saint Paul, foremost architect of the Christian church, anticipates Kant’s description of spiritual truth as something outside of sensory perception in I Corinthians Chapter 2: “We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, ... Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared”. In Paul’s view, we don’t get knowledge of God through our senses, but “God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.” Truth is truly outside of ourselves, and absolutely outside of our perception. It must be revealed by God. “Now we have received … the spirit which is of God; that we might know … not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth”. In this case, a viewer’s perception is useless, for truth can be known only through revelation to the spirit. Kant turned this around to teach that we cannot truly know any object outside of ourselves. All we can know is our view of that object. Thus, all knowledge is contingent on the subject, or subjective. There is no truth that we can find in an object, because we see that object only through our view. We see only our piece of it. From this point, he built a philosophical system which used scientific observation as a lens to determine what we can know, how we can know it, and how we learn it and describe it. At the same time, Kant held on to the notion that there may be truth that is outside of our ability to observe its phenomena, and so prove it. In fact, Kant felt he had proved that there were phenomena that did not have any observable traces, and so could not be known. He used the origin of matter in the universe as an example. It is here. It had to get here from somewhere, but where did it come from? Everything we can sense has an action and reaction. Everything has a start. So, what about matter? In short, Kant proved that we see things subjectively, but went on to show that this does not mean that objective truth does not exist, but only that we cannot observe objective truth, since we cannot observe the object itself. I will give you a CliffsNotes version to say that Kant built a science-based philosophy that still left room for Saint Paul’s belief that God’s truth could not come to us through our senses, but only through revelation.",kant took emergent sense self era made seat knowledge first promulgated belief subject viewer central knowledge object viewed socratics believed truth quality existed outside human perception job search plato unwittingly gave demonstration famous parable shadow cave touched people chained cave wall see shadow thrown object passing fire behind since ever see mistake shadow reality example perception seat knowledge instead false prophet truth exist perception person cave independent quality outside perception also outside cave jesus took step describing truth quality god independent perception possible truth god came god job accept god u saint paul foremost architect christian church anticipates description spiritual truth something outside sensory perception corinthian chapter “ speak wisdom god mystery even hidden wisdom eye hath seen ear heard neither entered heart man thing god hath prepared ” view get knowledge god sens “ god hath revealed unto u spirit ” truth truly outside absolutely outside perception must revealed god “ received … spirit god might know … word wisdom teacheth holy ghost teacheth ” case perception useless truth known revelation spirit kant turned around teach truly know object outside know view object thus knowledge contingent subject subjective truth find object see object view see piece point built philosophical system used scientific observation lens determine know know learn describe time kant held notion may truth outside ability observe phenomenon prove fact kant felt proved phenomenon observable trace could known used origin matter universe example get somewhere come everything sense action reaction everything start matter short kant proved see thing subjectively went show mean objective truth exist observe objective truth since observe object give cliffsnotes version say kant built science-based philosophy still left room saint belief truth could come u sens revelation,feser,3476,0

4097," **We Catholics reject Calvinism. I am thinking maybe you are channeling that and not Thomism?**      From what I studied, Thomism and Calvinism differ only on these three points:      1\. Whether G-d is the active author of sin. This is denied in Canon 6 of the 6th Council of Trent, which states that G-d caused the vocation of Paul but did not cause the betrayal of Judas. Calvinists would say G-d caused both.      2\. Whether G-d only named the names of the elect when He was dying on the cross. Calvinists regard it as blasphemous to say that a creature's free will can overpower Christ's sacrifice and thereby nullify it, so they see his dying as being limited in scope, and that for the reprobate it is as if Christ is an abstract Heavenly being (kind of like ""The Angel of the L-rd"" of the Hebrew Bible) who never became man (but will appear as the judge of the reprobate on the Great White Throne Judgment).      3\. Whether man is capable of doing any good by his own power. Thomists say yes, but natural goodness doesn't merit any kind of Heavenly reward. Calvinists say no, and that things which appear to be naturally good are tainted by impure motivations. Basically original sin vs. total depravity.

But he teaches here that it is _not_ justifiable to refrain from such criticism merely because it is difficult, or because we fear causing offense and losing friends, or because we don’t want to risk losing status or other worldly goods. For the wicked are in danger _of damnation_ if they do not repent, and we “wickedly blind ourselves” if we shirk our duty to encourage them to do so.

3672,"Tom,   ""Because you are unable to entertain any other ideas""   I entertained the idea that maybe Aquinas had some kind of sound argument.      Then I analyzed the First Way in detail, its premises, and its logical structure.      I identified several false premises and multiple instances of invalid logic in the First Way.      Recall, the First Way is ""The first and more manifest way"", in other words, Aquinas led with his best, his strongest, argument.      If the First Way is unsound then the foundation of A-T is unsound.      The First Way is unsound.      The human body, which is used in an example of objects not being able to move themselves, does in fact move itself, so Aquinas presents a false premise there.      An object in motion does not move ""only"" because it is being moved by another, since an object in inertial motion is not being moved by another, so there is another false premise by Aquinas.      When Aquinas says ""because then there would be no first mover"" he is begging the question by using the conclusion of the argument as a premise in the argument.      The First Way is founded on the false premise that absent an external mover a moving object will slow and stop and its motion will be lost and disappear from the universe.      Aquinas employs a false dichotomy between an infinite hierarchical regress or a finite hierarchical regress terminating in a single first mover, neglecting the third alternative of a circular regress terminating finitely in a multitude of mutual movers.      The last clause ""; and this everyone understands to be God."" is logically invalid in that there is no logical connection with the prior argument.      Koons has identified the lack of connection between god and the rest of the argument as the ""gap"" problem, in other words, the non-sequitur logical fallacy.      The argument from motion is based on what is ""evident to our senses, that in the world some things are in motion"", thus, physics. Koons tries to make some rather weak points that A-T is compatible with QM. Bmiller above kindly provided a link to an old Feser post wherein Feser argues for compatibility between inertial motion and a first mover.      Both Koons and Feser make the same error you made, in that compatibility is irrelevant. The First Way is not an argument for compatibility, it is an argument for necessity.      Aquinas falsely claims ""Therefore it is necessary to arrive at a first mover"" when in fact his argument is riddled with defects and is not worth the paper it was written on.

1840,"My recent article on [the error and condemnation of Pope Honorius](http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2022/10/the-error-and-condemnation- of-pope.html) has gotten a lot of feedback both here and at Twitter (much of the latter surprisingly civil and constructive for that venue). Because of the historical and theological complexities of the topic, several issues have arisen, but the main one I want to address here is the question of whether Honorius can plausibly be defended from the charge of heresy that the Sixth Ecumenical Council leveled against him. Keep in mind that what is at issue here is _not_ whether Honorius taught heresy while issuing a purported _ex cathedra_ definition. He was certainly not doing that, which is why the case of Honorius is irrelevant to whether popes are infallible when they _do_ teach _ex cathedra_ (which is all that the First Vatican Council taught in its decree on papal infallibility). What is at issue is whether Honorius taught heresy when _not_ speaking _ex cathedra_ – and, more generally, whether any pope could in principle do so.",recent article error condemnation pope honoriushttpedwardfeserblogspotcomthe-error-and-condemnation- of-popehtml gotten lot feedback twitter much latter surprisingly civil constructive venue historical theological complexity topic several issue arisen main one want address question whether honorius plausibly defended charge heresy sixth ecumenical council leveled keep mind issue whether honorius taught heresy issuing purported ex cathedra definition certainly case honorius irrelevant whether pope infallible teach ex cathedra first vatican council taught decree papal infallibility issue whether honorius taught heresy speaking ex cathedra – generally whether pope could principle,feser,1077,0

The choice to do X is different from the choice to do ~X because the effects are different, but if Libertarian Freedom is to work, the two effects could indeterministically come about from the same cause without any difference of intrinsic properties in it. If there was a difference which was associated only with X (and another with ~X) then that would entail that the agent would have already chosen either X or ~X, since he would have the corresponding property for one or the other.

My point was more that the nature of the Roman empire was such that when Christianity started to grow in towns and cities (within living memory of the events), if soldiers/officials etc based in Jerusalem at the time denied that a preacher called Jesus had been crucified at all, that would surely have been used as an argument against the Christians early on. However we have details of the criticisms against the early believers, and none of them were that Jesus had not existed, or that he had not been crucified etc.      So yes any local records were likely destroyed AD 70, but my contention is still that when you look at the development of civilisation up until then, although there were others that kept some level of written administration (such as the Egyptians, Assyrians, Greeks etc), the Romans were distinct in the likes of administration, language, education and commentary - across a vast portion of the known world - in a way that seems fitting to me for the incarnation, for the ‘covenant with all peoples’.

4456,"""and neither are any of God's perfections and human perfections.""      I disagree with that and you seem to be missing the point of analogy. Of course God is not perfectED but he nevertheless is *literally* perfect in the sense that he eminently possesses (eternally) all of the actualities that creatures come to possess when they are perfected. As I said, it has long been a standard thomistic view to say that God must *formally* possess all pure perfections. This is related to what names we can literally predicate of God with analogy. We don't say that God is wise just because God caused wisdom, just like we don't say God is a cat (though he is the cause of cats and hence has all of their actualities). Wisdom per se does not entail limitations, but on the contrary, an increase in being.      If you want to insist that this is no analogy of proper proportionality etc. and discuss terminology, nevertheless the metaphysical point remains that God must possess all of the actualities/perfections of its creatures (see ST I question 4 for instance), and hence be relevantly like a moral agent unless you think moral agency is intrinsically limiting.      Again, would you say that God is not intelligent? That God is not wise? That God is not free? Just because a perfection is found in a limited and creaturely manner in us, that does not mean it is not a pure perfection per se. The same goes for ""God is a moral agent"".      ""while the notion of moral is also rooted in the notion of custom (or more), which in turn is intrinsically (both conceptually and existentially) dependent upon a framework of human practices and institutions and corresponding ends and modes of excellence""      I completely disagree. To me, moral has to do with the necessary facts of ethics. ""Moral agency"" simply refers to the capacity of beings possessed with intellect and will (and hence freedom) to act in accordance with (or contrary to) the necessary moral facts (such as ""torturing people is wrong/evil""). God absolutely is a moral agent. Again, this has nothing to do with classical theism but rather with whether ""moral agent"" is a pure perfection or not.      And the point remains that when we attribute goodness, and moral goodness, to God (and we do; and in particular, Christian believers must do that) there must be some basic standards which God must fulfill, lest the attribution of goodness becomes equivocal. It would not do to say ""God is most wise!! Omniscient and perfectly knowing!"" and yet have God not actually knowing whether we exist or not. But if God does not care about the suffering of people (to the point where we could prima facie expect him to prevent or stop it) then this God is not ""good"". He might be ""good"" the way a squirrel that has all of its bodily parts is ""good"", but not good in the relevant sense that believers profess him to be - and would, again, strike many of us as a severely defective being (which should be impossible for the Purely Actual source of all existence and perfection). This is all that is needed to get the problem of evil going, however.      It amazes me how some people don't realize that the ""God is not a moral agent"" line not only is metaphysically problematic for many (again, it has to do with moral agency being a pure perfection or not, not with classical theism per se. There are also classical theists that deny there is knowledge in God, after all) but also only ""solves"" the problem of evil at the expense of making God unworthy of love and worship to most believers, as well as a severely defective and limited being to many metaphysicians.",neither perfection human perfection disagree seem missing point analogy course god perfected nevertheless literally perfect sense eminently posse eternally actuality creature come posse perfected said long standard thomistic view say god must formally posse pure perfection related name literally predicate god analogy say god wise god caused wisdom like say god cat though cause cat hence actuality wisdom per se entail limitation contrary increase want insist analogy proper proportionality etc discus terminology nevertheless metaphysical point remains god must posse actualitiesperfections creature see st question instance hence relevantly like moral agent unless think moral agency intrinsically limiting would say god intelligent god wise god free perfection found limited creaturely manner u mean pure perfection per se go god moral agent notion moral also rooted notion custom turn intrinsically conceptually existentially dependent upon framework human practice institution corresponding end mode excellence completely disagree moral necessary fact ethic moral agency simply refers capacity being possessed intellect hence freedom act accordance contrary necessary moral fact torturing people wrongevil god absolutely moral agent nothing classical theism rather whether moral agent pure perfection point remains attribute goodness moral goodness god particular christian believer must must basic standard god must fulfill lest attribution goodness becomes equivocal would say god wise omniscient perfectly knowing yet god actually knowing whether exist god care suffering people point could prima facie expect prevent stop god good might good way squirrel bodily part good good relevant sense believer profess - would strike many u severely defective impossible purely actual source existence perfection needed get problem evil going however amazes people realize god moral agent line metaphysically problematic many moral agency pure perfection classical theism per se also classical theist deny knowledge god also solves problem evil expense making god unworthy love worship believer well severely defective limited many metaphysicians,feser,3613,0

They potentially have such independent existence (via electrolysis), but until that happens what actually exists is the water as a whole substance.""      1\.

Well, Kant starts with the humean thesis that sense data can only generate contigent knowledge. He quickly realized that empiricism is dumb, for we do have necessary knowledge, so he was a sort of rationalist early. Necessary knowledge comes from reason.      But them Kant understood that sense data is pretty much how we have information about reality, so if our necessary knowledge does not come from the senses them it either:      1\. Has no basis on reality and is mere play with definitions(which smart empiricists do defend).      2\. Come from something else.      The prussian argued that at least mathematics is a sort of necessary knowledge that is not created by language, so 2 won. His answer was that we can know some truths about how we happen to organize sense data by analysing the necessary conditions to our experience to it to be how it is. For instance, every experience we have is in time, it has a sucession and all that, so we can derive several truths about that(inded, mathematics would have his origin on the forms of time and space).      And so, by knowing this structure we could show that every possible experience we could have need to obey a certain structure and so gather several truths about how things appear to us.

1494,"Mr. Jindra,      You are spot on that the materialist had not thought through his position, but you are mistaken in thinking that you have thought through yours. Dr. Yogami offers you some help above, some of which I am going to reiterate by explaining the difference between a debate and a lecture.      At a debate you consider whether a particular proposition is true or false. A debate such as the one noted above would normally be in a form such as: whether or not materialism is true. That would be the proposition under consideration and one person would take the affirmative side (i.e. Yes, it is true) and another would take the negative side (i.e. no it is not true).      In such a debate, it is important that the terms are defined. Otherwise, equivocation can occur and the debaters will talk past one another. So, it would be important to clarify that materialism is the assertion that matter is all that there is. Once that is established and the questions are established, folks then make arguments for their positions. That is the way a debate works.      Now what you describe is a situation where you refuse to participate in the debate and stand with your hands crossed. Well, that is not a debate. That is a lecture wherein, in this instance, you sit and listen to Dr. William Lane Craig and learn from him. Now that would be very good for you, but the point is that such a situation is not a debate.      In fact, it would be very awkward for you to stand in front of a crowd with a podium next to Dr. Craig and just gawk at him. You are going to have to say or do something. Now if you say something, you are doing to have to either: a. utter complete non-sense (perhaps you might simply repeat the letter Q over and over again), or b. make an argument for your case. Either way you end up looking like bafoon who cannot offer the slightest support for your position without showing your behind (here you and Walter and Dr. Craig's opponent have something in common).      Now, there is an alternative. Rather than saying something, you could do something. For example, you could do interpretive dance while Dr. Craig makes his arguments. You could do ballet and offer a rendition of the nutcracker. Or you might simply do the macarena. All viable options.      Or, perhaps, you might sit in the audience and learn from Dr. Craig. This last option seems to me the wisest alternative. But, then, we would not have a debate now would we? You would be the wiser and maintain your dignity, but this would be a lecture from Dr. Craig and not a debate.",mr jindra spot materialist thought position mistaken thinking thought dr yogami offer help going reiterate explaining difference debate lecture debate consider whether particular proposition true false debate one noted would normally form whether materialism true would proposition consideration one person would take affirmative side ie yes true another would take negative side ie true debate important term defined otherwise equivocation occur debater talk past one another would important clarify materialism assertion matter established question established folk make argument position way debate work describe situation refuse participate debate stand hand crossed well debate lecture wherein instance sit listen dr william lane craig learn would good point situation debate fact would awkward stand front crowd podium next dr craig gawk going say something say something either utter complete non-sense perhaps might simply repeat letter q b make argument case either way end looking like bafoon offer slightest support position without showing behind walter dr opponent something common alternative rather saying something could something example could interpretive dance dr craig make argument could ballet offer rendition nutcracker might simply macarena viable option perhaps might sit audience learn dr craig last option seems wisest alternative would debate would would wiser maintain dignity would lecture dr craig debate,feser,2569,0

2098,"Hey, Tom!      Thanks for answering me!      ""Even if you want to suggest that evolution is a good explanation for why we have such a feature, that itself is a pretty bad explanation for the feature itself.""      I don't want to suggest that evolution is a good explanation for the phenomena, I just asked what can we say in response to that - on a philosophical level. Because these guys I quoted use some energy trying to explain features, functions, etc. based on evolution and I wish to know how to prove on philosophical grounds why appealing to that is wrong.      In what follows, I will try to give some background.      ""In other words, how do you know that natural selection is blind, other than by assuming it, in which case there is nothing that you can say? But there is a lot of randomness in the environment in which natural selection operates.""      I'm not advocating that it's blind or not. I was quoting Ed - if I get him right anyway - on his answer to Ben Shapiro in this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FvYwpyFbIQ). You can see the specific question that Ben is formulating at 39:57 and Ed's response in the following minutes (but I would suggest that you watch the whole video).      Now, back to Ed's response - again, if I get him correctly - he's not arguing against Natural Selection blindness, he's saying Natural Selection could not explain why the human mind is directed at truth (it is really important to note that he's talking about TRUTH directness, not just any other feature in the present case) and I agree with him (because just like he said, natural selection explains fitness and passing genes). And it's important to note too the fact that he was presupposing that it was true when he formulated the argument - not because he may agree with it or not - but because its trueness or not had nothing to do to the point that he was making (again, he said that natural selection explains fitness, etc. and that's not related with the mind directedness for truth per see).      So, now that I made this background to avoid any misunderstandings what I'm trying to ask is: could we make a similar answer disentangling body unity and evolution or natural selection claims?      I do not have any problem with evolution at all. I was just trying to say that someone could conflate two problems (evolution on one side and unity and substantial form on the other).      For example: if someone says that our unity is caused by ""an evolutionary process that co-opted our cells to do what they do now'' someone, plausibly, may think that our unity is just an accidental one.      Personally, I don't think that's true - I think that's insane - but some people believe this. But I can't just say that that's insane - that would beg the question. Instead, I would have to argue philosophically to show that. And that's what I'm trying to say: these two problems i.e the unity substance's (or we can think of its organs functions related to each other as one indivisible unity) and natural selection or evolution could have nothing to do with it each other - but they might seem at least to be related and someone might argue something like the example I presented. That's why I'm asking Ed if we could (or how to) disentangle the two (like in the same way when he was explaining why truth per se has nothing to do with natural selection).",hey tom thanks answering even want suggest evolution good explanation feature pretty bad explanation feature want suggest evolution good explanation phenomenon asked say response - philosophical level guy quoted use energy trying explain feature function etc based evolution wish know prove philosophical ground appealing wrong follows try give background word know natural selection blind assuming case nothing say lot randomness environment natural selection operates advocating blind quoting ed - get right anyway - answer ben shapiro video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfvywpyfbiq see specific question ben formulating response following minute would suggest watch whole video back response - get correctly - arguing natural selection blindness saying natural selection could explain human mind directed truth really important note talking truth directness feature present case agree like said natural selection explains fitness passing gene important note fact presupposing true formulated argument - may agree - trueness nothing point making said natural selection explains fitness etc related mind directedness truth per see made background avoid misunderstanding trying ask could make similar answer disentangling body unity evolution natural selection claim problem evolution trying say someone could conflate two problem evolution one side unity substantial form example someone say unity caused evolutionary process co-opted cell someone plausibly may think unity accidental one personally think true - think insane - people believe say insane - would beg question instead would argue philosophically show trying say two problem ie unity think organ function related one indivisible unity natural selection evolution could nothing - might seem least related someone might argue something like example presented asking ed could disentangle two like way explaining truth per se nothing natural selection,feser,3372,0

With that said, I can't help but think you and Fr. Rooney (I did read his article) are being a bit obtuse here. Hart does not seem to be arguing that there is some power outside of God which compels God, removing God's free will, to create. Rather, his argument is that God's very *nature* is such that creation naturally follows from just who God is - it is the natural end result of God *being*. He who is Love, Good, etc. is, by virtue of who he is, going to create. It seems as though you and Fr.

In that case, _G_ might be defined by symmetries of the population and/or symmetries of the probability space. In such a setting, we might want a weaker Pareto principle that supposes additionally that _f_ ( _x_ , _ω_ ) < _g_ ( _x_ , _ω_ ) for some _x_ and _all_ _ω_. With that weaker Pareto principle, the proof that the existence of a _G_ -invariant preference of the right sort on the distributions implies local finiteness of action does not work. However, I think we can still prove local finiteness of action in that case if the symmetries in _G_ act only on the population (i.e., for all _x_ and _ω_ there is an _y_ such that _g_ ( _x_ , _ω_ ) = ( _y_ , _ω_ )). In that case, given a subset _A_ of the population _Q_ , we define _A_ † to be the distribution that gives _w_ to all the persons in _A_ with certainty (i.e., everywhere on _Ω_ ) and gives _v_ to everyone else, and the rest of the proof should go through, but I haven’t checked the details.",note natural think x set people location inspired kenny easwaranhttpswwwgooglecomurlqhttpsaffwwwdropboxcomfsfdklfwslqlrtsfaggregationpdffrawdsadsntzusgaovvawnfkxsldlphyvx- lddt one also think set q × ω ω probability space q population f x ω represents value x get location ω case g might defined symmetry population andor symmetry probability space setting might want weaker pareto principle supposes additionally f x ω g x ω x ω weaker pareto principle proof existence g -invariant preference right sort distribution implies local finiteness action work however think still prove local finiteness action case symmetry g act population ie x ω g x ω ω case given subset population q define † distribution give w person certainty ie everywhere ω give v everyone else rest proof go checked detail,pruss,1407,1

4121,"The knowledge that God exists, i.e., that He is actual, is certainly not a matter of faith: understanding that God exists requires no faith but is very simple knowledge accessible to all honest people, where by honest we define people who do not declare false the true or true the false.   From a logical point of view, the existence of God is not an axiom, in that it is not a self-evident statement in itself; it is not a hypothesis for the excellent reasons developed by Prof Feser; it is not a conjecture in that it is not a judgment based on non-evidential data: the existence of God is a reality that is logically proven, that is, it is a theorem, that is, grounded in logic, but also one that can be intuited by anyone, even without the pedantic and explicit use of formal logical reasoning.   I refer, for example, to the work of Christoph Benzmüller (preprint arXiv:2202.06264, 2022) for the very short proof and I limit myself to quote here the three axioms he uses:   (1) for any entity the lack of any property is not positive, (2) any property caused by another positive property is necessarily also a positive property, (3) ""being divine"" is a positive property.   The discussion is thus to be centered not on the existence of God as such but on the meaning of each of these axioms in our real world.   As Feser himself well points out, only considerations of necessity, and never of contingency as such, can lead to the truth of the claim of God's existence.   Humans, at 90 percent, usually intuitively perceive the unity of being, its positivity, and come to the conclusion that there must be a God aimed to maintain the coherence of what is good, positive and non-contradictory in their own experiential experience, that is, they ""experience"" these three axioms and they honestly intuit the only possible logical consequence.",knowledge god exists ie actual certainly matter faith understanding god exists requires faith simple knowledge accessible honest people honest define people declare false true true false logical point view existence god axiom self-evident statement hypothesis excellent reason developed prof feser conjecture judgment based non-evidential data existence god reality logically proven theorem grounded logic also one intuited anyone even without pedantic explicit use formal logical reasoning refer example work christoph benzmüller preprint arxiv short proof limit quote three axiom us entity lack property positive property caused another positive property necessarily also positive property divine positive property discussion thus centered existence god meaning axiom real world feser well point consideration necessity never contingency lead truth claim existence human percent usually intuitively perceive unity positivity come conclusion must god aimed maintain coherence good positive non-contradictory experiential experience experience three axiom honestly intuit possible logical consequence,feser,1843,0

3686,"@ Vincent Torley,      Particles that are bound are in a different state than ""free floating"" particles. In a living body the state of these particles is a complicated superposition of orthoganal functions of position and time. The eigenfunctions of their states are similarly local and complicated since potentials themselves vary in a complicated way inside a living body, and they certainly change when the body no longer functions, as in death, when neurons, muscle cells, etc., are no longer transmitting and conducting action potentials. Whether a physicist does or does not believe that there is such a thing as death, i.e. whether or not anything changes is not relevant to the truth ( it is absurd to think that nothing changes). Hylemorphism is not inconsistent with radical state change of the wave function of the entire body with death.      Furthermore, the study of brain states with various types of probes disturbs the states and causes them to be different than they would be while private, according to quantum mechanics, so attempting to understand a free mind by probing brain states is bound to be beset with difficulties.

Nay, further, it is not enough sincerely and firmly to assent to doctrines which, though not defined by any solemn pronouncement of the Church, are by her proposed to belief, as divinely revealed, in her common and universal teaching, and which the Vatican Council declared are to be believed ‘with Catholic and divine faith.’      But this likewise must be reckoned amongst the duties of Christians, that they allow themselves to be ruled and directed by the authority and leadership of bishops, and, above all, of the apostolic see. And how fitting it is that this should be so any one can easily perceive. For the things contained in the divine oracles have reference to God in part, and in part to man, and to whatever is necessary for the attainment of his eternal salvation.      Now, both these, that is to say, what we are bound to believe and what we are obliged to do, are laid down, as we have stated, by the Church using her divine right, and in the Church by the supreme Pontiff. Wherefore it belongs to the Pope to judge authoritatively what things the sacred oracles contain, as well as what doctrines are in harmony, and what in disagreement, with them; and also, for the same reason, to show forth what things are to be accepted as right, and what to be rejected as worthless; what it is necessary to do and what to avoid doing, in order to attain eternal salvation. For, otherwise, there would be no sure interpreter of the commands of God, nor would there be any safe guide showing man the way he should live.”      —Pope Leo XIII, Encyclical Sapientiae Christianae, n. 24, 1890      “It is not to be thought that what is set down in Encyclical Letters does not demand assent in itself, because in this the Popes do not exercise the supreme power of their magisterium. For, these matters are taught by the ordinary magisterium, regarding which the following is pertinent: ‘He who heareth you, heareth Me’ (Luke 10:16); and usually what is set forth and inculcated in the Encyclical Letters already pertains to Catholic doctrine. But if the Supreme Pontiffs in their acts, after due consideration, express an opinion on a hitherto controversial matter, it is clear to all that this matter, according to the mind and the will of the same Pontiffs, cannot any longer be considered a question of free discussion among the theologians.”      —Pope Pius XII Encyclical Humani Generis 1950        ",“ regard opinion whatever roman pontiff hitherto taught shall hereafter teach must held firm grasp mind often occasion requires must openly professed ” —pope leo xiii encyclical immortale dei n “ defining limit obedience owed pastor soul authority roman pontiff must supposed yielded relation dogma obstinate denial disjoined crime heresy nay enough sincerely firmly assent doctrine though defined solemn pronouncement church proposed belief divinely revealed common universal teaching vatican council declared believed ‘ catholic divine faith likewise must reckoned amongst duty christian allow ruled directed authority leadership bishop apostolic see fitting one easily perceive thing contained divine oracle reference god part part man whatever necessary attainment eternal salvation say bound believe obliged laid stated church using divine right church supreme pontiff wherefore belongs pope judge authoritatively thing sacred oracle contain well doctrine harmony disagreement also reason show forth thing accepted right rejected worthless necessary avoid order attain eternal salvation otherwise would sure interpreter command god would safe guide showing man way live ” —pope leo xiii encyclical sapientiae christianae n “ thought set encyclical letter demand assent pope exercise supreme power magisterium matter taught ordinary magisterium regarding following pertinent ‘ heareth heareth luke usually set forth inculcated encyclical letter already pertains catholic doctrine supreme pontiff act due consideration express opinion hitherto controversial matter clear matter according mind pontiff longer considered question free discussion among theologian ” —pope pius xii encyclical humani generis,feser,2954,0
1951,"@ Laudator Temporis Acti,      ""He doesn't ""want"" 127 to be a prime and 128 to be a power of 2. They are those things per se.""      They are these things for either one of two reasons.      First, they are so because of a system of axioms with rules of inference that allows us to prove it as a conclusion of a formal argument. This method of proof is not necessarily connected with the world we measure and physically inhabit. For example, without the infinite parallel postulate the axioms can have added to them an intrinsic curvature in which by locally parallel transport a circle can be constructed whose area is a rational multiple of its radius and this circle can definitely be squared.      So much for ""per se"" or human fiat. I don't even have to invoke the God beyond human understanding to get that.      The second method is by measuring the physical world we inhabit and building up a finite mathematics which cannot be fudged up by arbitrarily adding axioms which have not been physically proven themselves.      Well it is just God's choice (will) that the local physics supports your system. We can examine what God *can* do by examining what a model of God allows, but we cannot examine what God *cannot* do this way because God is greater than a model of God (a picture of you can show your hair color but it can't jump or walk - but you can jump or walk and jump because you are not limited by what the picture cannot do) . If you conclude from a model that God cannot do something, you have only proved that it can't be done in the model - which is not God.      A good physical model of God is a computer with a program. A computer program exists in which any circle, measured in the program, is exactly 6 times its radius. This can be illustrated as a virtual reality in which virtual actors measure virtual circles and always get that result. It can be shown as a visual animation that can be watched, as in a computer game. This is a model of God. If it can be made logical (in the measuring sense, the second method of proof, in which axioms are experimentally determined as described above) on a computer, then God can make it logical in physical reality, which, of course, would be a different physical reality then the one we have come to know and love.      Similarly, God is not limited to creating a physical universe where 127 is prime and 128 is a power of 2. It just outrages your sense of mathematical truth as it is known to you from living in this universe, but emotion doesn't belong in mathematical proofs (in this universe).      It is just an old ""rule"" without ground that mathematics and logic are independent of God. It is just an assumption.      ""So who is right?""

First, negatively, we have no good reason to think that all will be saved. Second, positively, we have testimony of Scripture as interpreted by the greatest doctors of the Church and the weight of the Church fathers denying the position of Origen. From this weight of this tradition, we find nothing like VB's mere wish given the misnomer ""hope"" (which is a theological virtue). Where then did VB get his inspiration for this position: again, as I noted above, it was influenced by Barth who had little role for cooperation with grace in his thought. From his foregone position, VB misrepresented the weight of tradition in the reading of the Church Fathers. He did not find something that no other theologian had seen that was actually present in the tradition. He creatively misrepresented the tradition to bend his ""research"" in the direction of foregone conclusions.

1416,"@ the emperor with no clothes      Okay, Walter, now that we have established that the emperor is walking around in the buff, let's try to put some clothes back on him.      You wrote:      ""theism cannot explain the rules of logic either and cannot take them as seperate entities because there are no entities that are truly seperate from God.""      As I pointed out above, theism is not pantheism, so you need to work on that distinction between credible, reliable witnesses and non-credible witnesses in order to have better discernment about who to listen to about what is or is not ""Theism"". Now that we have cleared this up, we can address the final false statement in your response (You squeezed in quite a few in that little post).      You claimed that theism has no means of accounting for the rules of logic. Well, you got that one wrong as well. Theism is the *only* means of accounting for the rules of logic. Let's recap on where we have gotten so far. It is clear, for reasons noted above, that the laws of logic exist. Anyone making an argument presupposes this. It is also clear, for reasons noted above, that the laws of logic are not material. Walter does not have them buried in his basement (In fact if they were anywhere, it is clear from the foregoing that they are not at Walter's house).      So, we have laws that exist and are immaterial. Along with this, these laws do not change from place to place or over time. They are eternal. They are not contingent on change in the material world. Yet these laws, just like numbers, have real implications in the material world.      The principle of non-contradiction is not *merely* a principle of thought. It also permeates material being. It is for this reason that no one has ever seen a non-chair-chair or a square circle or a married bachelor. They are impossible to conceptualize and they are impossible to be (or exist).      So, if these principles effect being and yet seem also to be mind dependent, how else do we account for them except by an eternal mind? Now Mr. Walter, if you have read your Edward Feser, you should be having flashbacks at this point because Dr. Feser makes precisely this argument with regard to numbers and other abstract objects in Five Proofs. He aptly refers to it as the Augustinian argument. Now we have cleared up the last of your string of misunderstandings. In the future, perhaps you might pause and reflect on whether or not it is cogent to try to convince us that your keyboard does not exist by means of typing on it.      Now, Mr. Don Jindra.

That is a different issue which is only tangentially related with divine creative freedom - the actual problem there is with the multiplicity of divine ideas. I can grant (as I have granted before) that there can be an objection from the fact that prima facie in DS God's ideas would all be the same, but there should be a multiplicity, etc. This is something that strikes us as being quite different from how us humans think (and by extension, intend things).      This is not the problem of ""how could God freely cause different things in different worlds without any intrinsic differences in God between worlds???"". I have been very clear and precise in my comments that it is *this* that I think is a bad objection which would also affect LFW for humans, not just God. And I have explained why.      So, using the terms in our latest posts: if we are to assume these ""Wills"" as you want, they would have to not determine the action. Someone would have both the ""Will-to-X"" and the ""Will-to-not-X"" and then be able to indeterministically cause either X or ~X in that case. So there would be no intrinsic difference in the subject required for him to cause X or cause ~X in that situation. The same as God.      What you CAN object is that, differently from us, under DS in God the ""Will- to-X"" would be the same as the ""Will-to-not-X"" and you could think that this is absurd. But then as I said this is a different objection - it's basically the issue of the multiplicity of divine ideas, only tangentially related to free choice (if one thinks ideas are required for choices). The issues of ""5 is different than 2!"" etc. I have talked about this in my last reply to Vincent. On this topic I'd just recommend Dolezal's model and how I think different facts can have the same truthmaker (similarly to how triangularity and trilaterality can have the same grounding).

1917,"@ Norm,      About Elon Musk, I said ""he doesn't spoil his act with prolonged ax grinding against an innocent target"". See that word ""prolonged"" in there? That was inserted with care. In other words I did not claim that he does not go after the innocent as well as the guilty. It is the hammering away at the same person that changes it from humor to something else.      ""I feel it's a bit uncharitable to lay all of the blame at the feet of Pope Francis""      Who has done that? Meanwhile, Francis is the pope now, so his actions will naturally get the most attention.      I have not been criticizing Pope Francis, but ""Amoris Laetitia"" (which you mention), the Pope's communication, has prompted many criticisms of the lack of guidance from the Pope, and if these criticisms were not well founded, the plain, simply spoken guidance becomes all the more important. That people feel the absence of this is a problem. The suffering of people who feel, rightly or wrongly, that the Church is going off the rails needs urgent attention, not ""official"" statements or abstruse theology from people no one has heard of. It needs careful shepherding by the person who issued the letter - the Pope.      That its absence is no excuse for loss or destabilization of faith really says nothing. No one has excuses for their sins, and yet everyone faces attacks caused by imperfect trust in God precisely because we are human, and that is why loving pastoral guidance is needed. ""Let God sort them out, I know why their fears are unjust"" is insufficient. The absence of this guidance is fair game for criticism. The respectful waiting that you advise justifiably grows into real criticism with time. It is in a sense an abandonment of the straying sheep who need to be brought back into the fold.

He just means that it is the sort of problem the solution to which seems clearly attainable using existing methods and standard scientific and philosophical assumptions.

1552,"As I said what really guts me is the fear of dying or believing something that is false. I know I may sound like a hypocrite or a fool (because I never gave up my faith in God). But that's just how I feel. And I admit that I think that I am only that way not just because of the overwhelming OCD that keeps triggering that thought and fear of being wrong in my mind but because I am too stupid and dumb to get things right (I'm not ashamed of saying that because it is true). If you ask me why metaphysical ideas are not affected by empirical conclusions I don't know what to say because I am simply too illiterate to understand the 'why question' and the difference between the two in the first place (even though I read Ed's blog posts about that e.g that one about the philosophy of nature). And I am afraid that someday some ""discovery"" may overthrow all of this.      I know that by the way the empirical sciences are derived today i.e that mathematized and abstract way it has nothing to do with and can't even scratch the A-T Meta at all. But my fear is what if there's some change in the methods or what if some way they could someway turn the tables against us? I admit that is not very clear to me how Metaphysics is separated from empirical matters.      But I remember seeing videos on youtube where Ed explains his road from atheism to theism (i.e by the way of philosophical reason and a lot of time studying those matters) and I think to myself: ""look at the certain look in the eyes of this man and how he defends the arguments he exposes"". I know that for a philosopher a straight face and seriousness don't mean that the argument is, in fact, good, but for the average joe like me, the impressions mean a lot (especially from a guy that comes from the other team i.e the atheist side because there must be some serious argument that made him change his mind in the first place). I think that you guys may understand what I want to say now. At the end of the day, every man wishes to learn the truth and die with it.      I don't know what to say. At Ed's blog, I somehow feel at home - even though I feel a lot of shame and fear of people mocking me and not taking me seriously, for example - it's hard to talk about that at least for me. But I swear to God that that's how I feel and in some way, that's why I'm somehow tied to buddhism because it ''ties'' my intellect into it i.e ""what if that insane ideology is true at the end of the day?""

4656,"N.b. I am the Anon that wrote the above post responding to @Infinite Growth (I had selected ""Anonymous"" by accident from the drop down).      To make clear what I meant by recent politics, take, for example, Act H.R.1226 and Senate Act S.447 through which certain organizations, with the aid of the US government, are trying to extract massive sums of money from the Polish state for so-called heirless property that once belonged to Jews. According to both Polish law and the general legal principle followed virtually everywhere, property without a legal heir reverts to the state after the death of its owner. If a legal heir exists, he is free to pursue restitution like everyone else through the Polish courts. The absurd position of certain groups is that the Polish government should treat these cases in a extraordinary way and offer broad restitution anyway, not to any heirs, because of course they don't exist, but to organizations and people who are not legal heirs. And recall that this was property held by Polish citizens as Polish Jews were Polish citizens. By reinforcing the notion that Poles, as a corporate body, are guilty of collaborating in the criminal program of the Nazis, it becomes easier to make claims on the Polish state. Heirless property, combined with a sprinkle of customary special pleading, misrepresentation, and the thought- diffusing VIP pass that is the word ""Holocaust"", provides a convenient opportunity for unscrupulous organizations to illegitimately extract billions of dollars from the Polish state by exploiting the emotional force of a historical tragedy. Perhaps such organizations should instead direct their claims to Berlin as the German state is responsible for handling the restitution of Jewish property lost through actions of the Nazi regime.

1993,"(final segment--see previous 3 posts from me)      So, taking all of these points together, we are left to wonder if anyone can be declared FORMALLY heretical posthumously (at least in a case where there is no evidence they were judged heretical and obstinately persisted in their views). This then raises the question as to whether one can, and/or should, be anathematized posthumously at all. This has obviously occurred, presumably also in cases other than that of Honorius, so it certainly can happen. BUT, what we do not have in Honorius's case is a judgment that he was FORMALLY heretical (a distinction I suspect was not fully formulated or conceived at the time of Council condemning him). And once this distinction between formal and material heresy is made, we must face more squarely whether it is appropriate, or even possible, to condemn someone who is not formally heretical (as it seems Honorius could not have been). Prior to this distinction being made, we can likely forgive such anathemas, but it seems this distinction now affects how such judgments can be made (and perhaps even how we assess anathemas given before the material/formal distinction was fully developed).      In any case, we see that it was only a future pope and council who passed these judgments about a previous pope. At the very least, this should give great pause to anyone not in such authority to presume too definitely that anything a current or previous pope did was heretical. But this is especially true if one goes down the path of implying formal heresy, as for a current pope that would ultimately require the judgment of the Pope himself, and would be questionable if even a current Pope could do that in respect to a previous Pope (see above). I realize Feser is not arguing otherwise, but I suspect some who read this might apply what he says to current situations and neglect to appreciate the limits the points I raise place on such assessments. (And, we might add, such people could never have it seems even more than an opinion, though perhaps a well informed one, that a current pope held even a materially heretical view, since the judgment of heresy would ultimately fall to the Pope himself).      All this said, to reiterate a previous key point, in respect to Honorius, we can ask whether the current distinction between formal and material heresy would preclude anathemas like those against Honorius from taking place today. And, we may even ask whether the authority of a current pope would permit qualifying, or perhaps even removing, the judgment against Honorius in later councils, depending upon the extent to which one determines juridical declarations of councils (bearing in mind juridical decisions do not seem to be infallible, even if in their time they are authoritative), are or are not components of magisterial tradition which oblige agreement with current judgments, papal or otherwise.

But the same applies to your trying to hold God-as-a-moral-agent to your standards of morality and rationality -- it's not metaphysically possible that your confidence in doing so could be warranted. Given your metaphysical relationship to God, it doesn't make sense. So your claim, that ""the problem of evil is a challenge to God's existence,"" is ambiguous: if you regard it as equivalent to ""I have a problem reconciling my views about evil and about the nature of God,"" fine, that's a subjective report, but the post here addresses that problem; if it means ""there's a real problem here for which we have no adequate solution,"" then I think you're mistaken and possibly begging the question.

489,"Abstract: Scoring rules measure the accuracy or epistemic utility of a credence assignment. A significant literature uses plausible conditions on scoring rules on finite sample spaces to argue for both probabilism—the doctrine that credences ought to satisfy the axioms of probabilism—and for the optimality of Bayesian update as a response to evidence. I prove a number of formal results regarding scoring rules on infinite sample spaces that impact the extension of these arguments to infinite sample spaces. A common condition in the arguments for probabilism and Bayesian update is strict propriety: that according to each probabilistic credence, the expected accuracy of any other credence is worse. Much of the discussion needs to divide depending on whether we require finite or countable additivity of our probabilities. I show that in a number of natural infinite finitely additive cases, there simply do not exist strictly proper scoring rules, and the prospects for arguments for probabilism and Bayesian update are limited. In many natural infinite countably additive cases, on the other hand, there do exist strictly proper scoring rules that are continuous on the probabilities, and which support arguments for Bayesian update, but which do not support arguments for probabilism. There may be more hope for accuracy-based arguments if we drop the assumption that scores are extended-real-valued. I sketch a framework for scoring rules whose values are nets of extended reals, and show the existence of a strictly proper net-valued scoring rules in all infinite cases, both for f.a. and c.a. probabilities. These can be used in an argument for Bayesian update, but it is not at present known what is to be said about probabilism in this case.",abstract scoring rule measure accuracy epistemic utility credence assignment significant literature us plausible condition scoring rule finite sample space argue probabilism—the doctrine credence ought satisfy axiom probabilism—and optimality bayesian update response evidence prove number formal result regarding scoring rule infinite sample space impact extension argument infinite sample space common condition argument probabilism bayesian update strict propriety according probabilistic credence expected accuracy credence worse much discussion need divide depending whether require finite countable additivity probability show number natural infinite finitely additive case simply exist strictly proper scoring rule prospect argument probabilism bayesian update limited many natural infinite countably additive case hand exist strictly proper scoring rule continuous probability support argument bayesian update support argument probabilism may hope accuracy-based argument drop assumption score extended-real-valued sketch framework scoring rule whose value net extended real show existence strictly proper net-valued scoring rule infinite case fa ca probability used argument bayesian update present known said probabilism case,pruss,1755,1

2417," _If a human on this Earth can choose a lesser good instead of a greater good, that is a imperfection._      A lamb which is killed by a lion for food is an imperfect lamb, also.      As I already indicated, the state of a man on Earth able to sin _is indeed_ less complete and less perfect than his state in heaven, when he is no longer able to sin, (though he has MORE, not less, freedom). This lesser sort of perfection may be called ""imperfection"" in one sense, or it may be called a ""more limited"" condition that is _proper to one still in this life_ : Either way, one must keep the _sense_ being used clear. Hence, one cannot employ the position that our ""being able to sin"" represents an ""imperfection"" and conclude that this contradicts Genesis saying that when God made the world, it was ""good"" because man able to sin is ""not good"". That doesn't follow. A lamb is able to die, and that's a lack of divine perfection (for God cannot die), but it's a kind of ""im""perfection that is more properly understood as a _lesser kind_ of perfection. And God intended a universe filled with beings which are imperfect compared to Him, because it is impossible for Him to have created beings that are uncreated perfection. He also intended a universe with men who were capable of sin who then could achieve later the condition of the Beatific Vision and no longer able to sin, by way of meritorious acts of love of God made even IN the condition of able to sin.

4007,"I think this discussion is quite useful. As recent Popes have not taught heresy per se, and it seems no Pope ever has, the rationale for resisting some wishes of a Pope does not have to be because they have fallen into heresy, but simply because his every wish or thought is not infallible. It's also true that being mistaken, or taking actions that are extremely harmful to the Church do not mean the Pope has become a heretic (or, on the view of some, he is not a Pope).      There have been a number of responses to the confusion since Vatican II. One, championed by the Opus Dei, for example, makes every effort to remain orthodox, while putting what the Pope does in the best possible light, generally not criticizing other parts of the Church, but speaking and working behind the scenes. This has made it possible for them to do a lot of good work.      Another response has been that of Archbishop Lefebvre and the Saint Pius X Society. They have loudly attacked aspects of Vatican II (which they say must be authoritatively interpreted in the light of the traditional teachings of the Popes), and refused the accept the new liturgy. In order for them to do this, Archbishop Lefebvre consecrated four bishops against the wishes of Rome. At the same time, he and his congregation have never suggested any changes to the structure of the Church. They are Roman to the core, they simply believe that the Popes since Vatican II have made some big mistakes (that do not affect their infallibility) that warrant not being followed.      Lately there seems to be a third position that should be worrying orthodox Catholics. It consists in, not just challenging the current Pope or refusing to recognize him, but a plan for a new Church structure. Here are a couple of recent examples.      One is from John Lamont, in a debate featured on the Rorate Caeli site: ""An admission that Pope Francis is a heretic destroys this cult-like understanding of the Church. It requires the Catholic faithful to exercise their faith in the words of Our Lord on their own, without the instruction of their bishops..."" Secondly, this excerpt from an article by Peter Kwasniewski, where he argues, incongruously, for traditionalists not to leave the Church: "" if a pope says that all that I love about the Latin Church is “rigid” and “nostalgic” and “out of date” and “closed off to surprises” and whatever other nonsense he comes out with, I will know that he is in the devil’s pay, since no pope who was a believer in Christ and a practicing Catholic would ever speak thus..."". What Pope Francis is supposed to have done here is very far from heresy. Will we be next be told that he used a diabolical number of fingers to make the sign of the cross.      Kwasniewski says he could not leave because Orthodoxy is a different ""flesh and blood tradition and that his home is the West. It seems to me that he ignores the many attempts that have been made to create Western Orthodoxies. I believe we might be witnessing another of these. By ""staying"" in the West physically, but teaching an ecclesiology that is not Catholic, this group looks more like the modernists who persisted in undermining the Church from within. It might be very wrong to call liturgical traditionalism nostalgia, but attacking the structure of the Catholic Church is much worse.",think discussion quite useful recent pope taught heresy per se seems pope ever rationale resisting wish pope fallen heresy simply every wish thought infallible also true mistaken taking action extremely harmful church mean pope become heretic view pope number response confusion since vatican ii one championed opus dei example make every effort remain orthodox putting pope best possible light generally criticizing part church speaking working behind scene made possible lot good work another response archbishop lefebvre saint pius x society loudly attacked aspect vatican ii say must authoritatively interpreted light traditional teaching pope refused accept new liturgy order archbishop lefebvre consecrated four bishop wish rome time congregation never suggested change structure church roman core simply believe pope since vatican ii made big mistake affect infallibility warrant followed lately seems third position worrying orthodox catholic consists challenging current pope refusing recognize plan new church structure couple recent example one john lamont debate featured rorate caeli site admission pope francis heretic destroys cult-like understanding church requires catholic faithful exercise faith word lord without instruction bishop secondly excerpt article peter kwasniewski argues incongruously traditionalist leave church pope say love latin church “ rigid ” “ nostalgic ” “ date ” “ closed surprise ” whatever nonsense come know pay since pope believer christ practicing catholic would ever speak thus pope francis supposed done far heresy next told used diabolical number finger make sign cross kwasniewski say could leave orthodoxy different flesh blood tradition home west seems ignores many attempt made create western orthodoxy believe might witnessing another staying west physically teaching ecclesiology catholic group look like modernist persisted undermining church within might wrong call liturgical traditionalism nostalgia attacking structure catholic church much worse,feser,3333,0

3547,"I would emphasize a further point. It is commonly assumed that scientific theory gives us a richer and more accurate representation of the world than common sense does, and indeed ought to replace the commonsense description of phenomena. But as Cartwright’s argument indicates, this is the reverse of the truth. For one thing, scientific theory in fact cannot even be given a determinate interpretation without some connection to the ordinary linguistic usage from which its concepts ultimately derive, and the concrete applications to which theory is put. For another thing, what theory describes are really only abstract features of the world of common experience rather than that world in all its rich complexity. That doesn’t necessarily entail that scientific theory should be given an instrumentalist rather than realist interpretation. But it does support the epistemic structural realist view that, while what theory describes is really there in nature, it is very far from capturing everything that is there in nature. (See _Aristotle’s Revenge_ for detailed exposition and defense of this view.)",would emphasize point commonly assumed scientific theory give u richer accurate representation world common sense indeed ought replace commonsense description phenomenon argument indicates reverse truth one thing scientific theory fact even given determinate interpretation without connection ordinary linguistic usage concept ultimately derive concrete application theory put another thing theory describes really abstract feature world common experience rather world rich complexity necessarily entail scientific theory given instrumentalist rather realist interpretation support epistemic structural realist view theory describes really nature far capturing everything nature see revenge detailed exposition defense view,feser,1106,0

3748,"I think you are missing Feser’s point in completely the opposite direction. He is obviously not arguing that the fault in the atomist’s logic is not reducing fat enough, but rather their entire notion that everything is reducible to the colorless, tasteless, heatless objects is off from the start. And he has provided a myriad of arguments for this in other locations.      You are therefore missing Feser’s point again when you say that he is not reducing fat enough when he considers water more fundamental that it’s constituent elements. None of this entails a denial of science, chemistry, or physics by the way, and I think Feser would argue the opposite. The only way to make sense of the scientific process and discoveries of modern science is if our sense aren’t wrong. And the sense in which water is more fundamental has to do more with intentionality, and how these parts ultimately serve the purpose of the greater whole.      Lastly, to your point that quantum mechanics has problems, that doesn’t entail that quantum hylomorphism is right. Well, you are correct, but I think again missing part of the point. There could be alternative correct interpretations, but this book is what is making the argument for quantum hylomorphism in detail. Feser is just reviewing the book in a few paragraphs. Also, I think the more important takeaway is that the problems with quantum mechanics are in its interpretation, as opposed to us missing the exact value of mass of some subatomic particle. The fact that we have no satisfactory interpretation for a scientific process we know with certainty to be at least partially mathematically correct (measurement problem) is good reason to consider other kinds of philosophical viewpoints. And the point Feser is making is that, unsurprisingly, the Aristotelian view of matter seems to fit what we observe in the quantum realm. I can’t speak to exactly how much I agree with this, as I am neither a PhD physicist or thomist philosopher, but I don’t think it’s a good counter argument to merely say, you just haven’t reduced far enough, the senses are mere illusions.

The same eternal decision of having the Fall got at the same time the aincarnation decision.""      I don't think I agree with that. I would say God can choose at t2 something that he would not have chosen at t1, if, for instance, something happened at t2 which had not happened before it. For instance, if you just decided to go pray at t2, but not at t1, God might then have decided at t2 to make himself present to you or whatever, in response to what you chose to do at t2.   But of course, I reject foreknowledge, so there's that.      But even under foreknowledge it is still plausible that God's choices are taken in different logical moments (even if not at different temporal moments), we might say. Because we want to say (if we believe in free will) that God chooses to do things in response to our choices. So these particular choices of God will at least be dependent on our making of the choices (maybe, if you believe in foreknowledge, God chose everything he would do at the very same temporal moment he created the world, but there must have been some logical priority to his choice of creating the world, since your choices - and therefore God's responses to your choices - are dependent upon that world being made).      Of course, none of that (not even my own view) needs to entail that God is temporal. My view of time is the classical Aristotelian one as the ""measure of change"", not the confused modern one. God choosing what to do at t2 (and not at t1) doesn't entail that God is temporal unless it also entails that God undergoes a change of intrinsic properties when he makes the choice, which classical theists should deny. If it implies God is ""temporal"", it is only in a way that would be perfectly open to classical theists (since it wouldn't imply God is changing).",anyway even take view would incarnation fall true god decision sending son happened fall outside timeas st augustine argued god something like thinking time choosing time eternal decision fall got time aincarnation decision think agree would say god choose something would chosen instance something happened happened instance decided go pray god might decided make present whatever response chose course reject foreknowledge even foreknowledge still plausible choice taken different logical moment even different temporal moment might say want say believe free god chooses thing response choice particular choice god least dependent making choice maybe believe foreknowledge god chose everything would temporal moment created world must logical priority choice creating world since choice - therefore response choice - dependent upon world made course none even view need entail god temporal view time classical aristotelian one measure change confused modern one god choosing entail god temporal unless also entail god undergoes change intrinsic property make choice classical theist deny implies god temporal way would perfectly open classical theist since imply god changing,feser,2101,0

4111,"""Suppose, for example, that someone said that he was contemplating Aquinas’s First Way or... I personally think both those arguments happen to be successful demonstrations of God’s existence.""      The First Way attempts to use scientifically testable observations as a basis for logical arguments for the existence of god.      The First Way is an argument from motion, which is offered in the general sense of change of heat in the example of heat-fire-wood. Motion is also used in its more common literal sense, as positional translation through space, in the example of hand-staff.      Thus, if one is using the First Way as an argument for the existence of god then the assertion of the existence of god is indeed a scientific hypothesis in that the examples of the First Way are scientifically falsifiable.      Science has already falsified the argument from motion, therefor the god hypothesis has been scientifically falsified, to the extent it depends upon the First Way, which has already been falsified.      The statement ""the staff moves only because it is put in motion by the hand"" is clearly false, as the staff will move ad infinitum (as Aristotle posited for motion in the void) absent an impeding medium. The fundamental error of Aristotle, Aquinas, Feser, and the majority of posters here is in failing to realize that space, for motion, is the functional equivalent of the void, and everything is in space, including the hand and the staff.      The false statement by Aquinas that ""the staff moves only because it is put in motion by the hand"" is based on the false notion that absent a continuous mover the staff will slow, and stop, and its motion will be lost, therefore, it was incorrectly thought, a mover is required to keep it moving.      In truth, all objects in the universe are part of a system of perpetual motion such that motion is never lost, only transferred and mutually perpetuated in some form.      ""arguing that nothing that is like that could exist even for an instant without a sustaining cause""   Feser has this back to front in a very strange inversion of logic.      If material exists at time1 and continues to exist at time2 that is no change in the existence of that material, therefore no changer is called for to account for no change.      If material exists at time1 and ceases to exist at time2 that is a change in the existence of that material, therefore a changer is called for to account for the change in the existence of that material.      Sustained existence = no change, therefore, no changer.   Unsustained existence = change, therefore, a changer.      Pretty simple.

I find any such analysis to be superior to vague claims such as ""racism is bad, and isn't that sad"" which seem to dominate so much of our culture's discussion of race.      It's entirely reasonable to challenge, and perhaps dismiss, any particular plan of action. But the way to do that is to replace one plan with another, not to merely content ourselves with rejectionism.      What typically happens is that somebody will suggest some plan, everyone else will immediately starting proclaiming it wrong, while offering no plan of their own, and so nothing happens, and centuries of racial divide continues.

3685,"Hi Tom Cohoe and grodrigues,      We seem to be talking at cross-purposes. What I'm talking about are the intrinsic properties of elementary particles (such as quarks and electrons). These do not change when particles are bound in a structure - be it a living human body or an inanimate chemical lattice. What changes, as you rightly point out, are the interactions between the particles and their surrounding environment - interactions which can be described by the Schroedinger wave equation that governs their wavefunctions. (Yes, I have studied the Schroedinger wave equation, although it was over 40 years ago.) The fact that elementary particles behave differently when in the neighborhood of other particles no more proves that they cease to be elementary particles and that their identity is subsumed within that of the body they comprise than the fact that cars in a traffic jam behave differently than cars on the open road proves that they thereby cease to be cars and that their identity is taken over by that of the traffic jam they comprise.      So when David Oderberg (who is a philosopher) writes that ""[t]he substantial forms of the particles exist virtually in the substances they constitute. In other words, the quark is ontologically dependent on the whole of which it is a part, but its causal powers persist, albeit in a way radically limited by the whole,"" I have to respectfully disagree. A bound quark is still a quark, and its causal powers, which derive from its intrinsic properties, are still intact. Putting it another way: we don't need to do biology in order to understand quarks, be they quarks inside a human body or outside.      Of course, as I mentioned earlier, particles themselves can be viewed as excitations of underlying fields, but that's another matter altogether, and one that's irrelevant to hylomorphism.      Re quantum indeterminacy: pardon my somewhat clumsy formulation, but I was alluding to the fact that the propositional distributive law, p and (q or r) = (p and q) or (p and r), doesn't appear to hold in the quantum realm. To be fair, this claim is contested - see this paper here, which appeals to Bohmian mechanics (which is itself a highly contentious interpretation of QM, as it posits hidden variables): https://www.mdpi.com/2624-960X/2/4/42/htm      My point was that whatever Aristotelian potency means, it certainly doesn't mean quantum fuzziness.

Second, Leo did confirm the council, and thereby lent authority to its decrees. And those decrees explicitly condemn Honorius as a heretic.

4009,"The primary locus of teaching authority - with the force of certainty and which commands the assent of faith - is in God Himself. The _derivative_ ""primary"" locus of that authority is in _the Church_ , to whom He granted teaching authority and to whom he gives protective grace and inspiration, and whom has Jesus Christ as her Head. This is the magisterial authority of the Church, and in this rests the magisterial office of the Church. The bishops - each bishop - _participate_ in the exercise of that magisterial office when they teach in His name, and to those teachings we normally owe religious assent. The pope exercises that magisterial office in a particular (extraordinary) way when he teaches infallibly in an ex cathedra declaration, to which we owe unreserved assent; he also exercises the magisterial office in a most excellent _ordinary_ way when he teaches in an ordinary way _what the Church teaches_ , to which we owe a particularly high degree of religious assent according to the manner in which he manifests his call to receive that teaching. While the pope can, by his special office, call us to a most fulsome **degree** of religious assent to a teaching, a higher degree than that to which individual bishops normally can call us, the _general nature_ of that assent remains religious assent, which is not of the same KIND as the unreserved assent we give to those infallible teachings that call for divine and catholic faith. The pope, like the bishops, always participates in the charism granted by Christ to the Church in her teaching authority, when he teaches in a way that calls forth our assent (either unreserved or the lesser kind in religious assent).

3167," _That said, perhaps in favor of Feser's stance, I think one could say that we need to accept the judgment of a council on the presumption they got it right, even if we recognize that in principle it could be corrected later by a proper authority, We could in fact even adduce evidence for why such a later correction could be justified._      I admit I might be wrong on this point, but even this seems a little too strong to me. It is simply a fact that on matters of history - which the condemnation of Honorius is - it is in no way impious to judge that the Council was wrong.

127,"1) I think the participationism explanation is problematic, since by that same logic one could maybe deny one truly possesses being or goodness or value; one could even deny one causes anything at all, concluding occasionalism. But we do have our own being & goodness, so it's not the divine being & goodness in us, per Aquinas.         2) In fact, there's a real sense in which our actions & thereby accomplishments are uniquely our own in a way they aren't God's precisely because our actions are rooted in our secondary causality, which is distinct from God's causality. And secondary causality being distinct from primary causality, the causal responsibility for secondary causal acts is in the creature, since the primary causality of God in sustaining our actions in existence only determins them insofar as they exist, but we determine them insofar as whether we cause them to occur (the occurrence of them is distinct from their basic existence) and what we cause to occur.      3) Additionally, there may be a difference between bragging and general pride - some moral theology manuals seem to suggest being proud of one's accomplishments isn't sinful, because that's distinct from bragging morally. And one can't be proud of things one doesn't truly possess or cause in some way.      Of course, other sources say any form of pride is sinful, so this isn't a clear issue it seems - but if one did take the route that some forms of pride ARE morally okay, then this makes the thesis we don't possess anything, whether being or our actions, unlikely.",think participationism explanation problematic since logic one could maybe deny one truly posse goodness value one could even deny one cause anything concluding occasionalism goodness divine goodness u per aquinas fact real sense action thereby accomplishment uniquely way precisely action rooted secondary causality distinct causality secondary causality distinct primary causality causal responsibility secondary causal act creature since primary causality god sustaining action existence determins insofar exist determine insofar whether cause occur occurrence distinct basic existence cause occur additionally may difference bragging general pride - moral theology manual seem suggest proud accomplishment sinful distinct bragging morally one proud thing one truly posse cause way course source say form pride sinful clear issue seems - one take route form pride morally okay make thesis posse anything whether action unlikely,pruss,1558,1

1397,"WCB,      I have already noted Komline's Augustine on the Will in the Oxford Historical Theology series published in 2019. I have also noted some of the relevant works of St. Augustine that you are not familiar with that show that he did not change his position. The work that shows this most clearly is a work written by St. Augustine at the end of his life called: The Retractions. St. Augustine knew that his writings would be maintained and widely read after his death because his fame was already so widespread during his life. He was also, like any faithful Catholic, concerned about orthodoxy and that he did not lead others into error in any way. This reflects his charity, which is why he was a saint.      In order to ensure that any mistakes in his writings did not lead others astray, he read through them at the end of his life carefully and retracted any statements that were erroneous. Such retractions are found in his work: The Retractions. This is relevant for our discussion because he revisited his early Cassiacum dialogues, including On the Freedom of the Will. And did he make the sweeping assertion that he completely rejected his early account of the will in this work? Nope. He made small and precise corrections to his cassiacum dialogues while continuing to hold to his main lines of argument within them.      St. Augustine was a clear, compelling, cogent, and precise thinker. That precision entailed that he avoided gross and unsupported generalizations of the sort that fly off your keyboard, WCB. So, no he didn't ""reject his account of the will"". That sweeping generalization has as much support as your other sweeping generalizations. That is, it has no support.

That does _not_ entail that all theories are equally good, but only that considerations independent of both theory and empirical evidence are ultimately necessary in order to choose between theories.

For example, in _The Encyclopedia of Philosophy_ ’s article on “Contingent and Necessary Statements,” necessity is characterized as “what must occur,” whereas contingency involves “what may or may not occur.” _The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy_ defines “necessity” as “a modal property attributable to a whole proposition… just when it is not possible that the proposition be false.” Wuellner’s _Dictionary of Scholastic Philosophy_ defines “necessary” as “that which cannot not-be,” “that which must be and be as it is,” and “that which must act as it does and which cannot act otherwise.” Obviously, Hart thinks God’s creation of the world _must_ occur, given his nature. He thinks that it is _not possible_ that the proposition that _God creates the world_ be false. He thinks that God _must_ act to create the world, that his act of creation _cannot not-be_.

For instance, with homework, _A_ is the student’s having time for other classes and for non- academic pursuits and _B_ is the student’s learning more about the subject at hand. With exam difficulty, _A_ may be avoiding frustration and _B_ is giving a worthy challenge. With a walk, _A_ is reducing fatigue and _B_ is increasing health benefits.

This is counterintuitive: it seems to imply that you can know that you will have enough evidence to know something even though you don’t yet. In a comment, Ian noted that one way out of this is to say that beliefs do not correspond to sharp credences.

4373,"“ Psalm 50:11: I know all the birds of the mountains; And the wild beasts of the field are mine.”      Where suffering of animals is as part of nature, we must trust that to God. Life could not have evolved without suffering, and we must trust that the rich tapestry of dark and light is perfectly rounded in the end. “All is well” as He told Julian of Norwich. This is just faith in God’s goodness, and I have confidence that the great suffering of animals in nature will make be a necessary part of a perfect plan when we see things as they are.      Where it’s caused by humans, we are responsible. We each are called to play our part in reducing the suffering of others, as far as we are able. I can’t judge a poor person who overworks a donkey to build a house, or buys factory farmed meat, but those who can afford to support better welfare and always choose the cheapest/cruelest must be at least partly responsible for the cruelty.      It’s similar with children. We can’t see God’s full plan, but we know that life is short for all of us next to eternity. We can only play our part in reducing it where we can, and trust the rest to God.      As Augustine alludes to, some who have suffered the most can become the purest, most loving people you could meet. Others become hard and cruel. God is refining us like “silver in the furnace”. If we go with the process as he asks us to, and most of the saints actually welcome suffering in themselves, we have good reason to believe that it’s to our benefit in the long run. Most difficult of course is when it’s others suffering, especially those we love. But it’s exactly the same in that we can do what we can to help (including righteous anger in the very rare cases where that is the right response), but must do all we can to avoid becoming hard and cruel ourselves in response. Difficult as it may be, we must trust. We must try to see that what is sharp and apparently meaningless in the moment, is very different from the widest perspective.      Ultimately we are all called to follow the “suffering servant”, born to “Our Lady of Sorrows”.

I have carefully examined a lot of classical theologians on this point.Augustine, Boethius, Ansalm, William of Okham, Duns Scotus, Aquinas, Molina and others. And some of the enormous modern secondary literature.      Augustine assert that though God foresees all he does not cause all. Boethius claims that as a man sees something, that man does not cause what he sees. Thus God sees future events but likewise does not cause them. And on and on it goes. Everybody is indeed wrong      The particular argument I posted is not answered by the nearly 1600 years of theologians trying to explain the issue of God's foreknowledge and free will. Not until Luther's ""Bondage Of The Will"" did the issue of this become a problem.      Late in his life after the Pelagian affair Augustine gave up on free will, which was followed by Calvin, Luther et all.      I am sure that somewhere somebody else has made the argument I have, but I have yet to see anybody that has among the theologian community.

Today's answer from theists is that has all been answered long ago by classical theists. This is not true.

3448,"While I hold a lot of skepticism about McGinn's use of mysterianism on the hard problem of conscious thought, as a Cathlolic I also would tend to be very, very cautious about castigating mysterianism _altogether_.

Suffice it to say: we cannot invoke mysterianism _merely_ because it is a hard problem. There must be a properly accounted reason that _explains_ our inability to access the thoughts needed. In the case of God, we are limited intelligences, and he is unlimited intelligence, and so our minds are not of a nature capable (on their own) of encompassing the whole of God. But that account doesn't work for our own minds: presumably, the nature and workings of our minds are correlative to _our minds_.      However, it may be possible to argue that we cannot _in principle_ access the way our minds work **directly** , because when we are thinking an immaterial thought (say, about pi), we cannot ALSO be thinking second-layer thinking _about_ that thought, (at least, without the danger of disturbing and ending the thought about pi in order to think the thought ABOUT the thought about pi.

""he discounted the notion of the void, thinking, among other things, that speed would go to infinity absent the sublunary impeding medium""      Absent the impeding medium which removes energy from objects in motion, a continuing force would cause the speed to go to infinity.

Of course, prophets are typically resisted, but not by everyone, which is why they go on to be revered and their message has an impact at least after their deaths.

Going straight to the point I must say that the existence of universals is one of the most important points in philosophy because its consequences/ what follows from it have a huge impact on how the world really is.      Nominalism has many varieties but I think it's safe to say that at the end of the day, all of them affirm the same damn thing (i.e the inexistence of universals) and fail exactly in it in different ways i.e they always smuggle universals in the background. It doesn't matter if its an Ockham variation, a Sellar's ""metalinguistic"" one, a buddhist one, or whatever (of course, to see how it fails specifically, you will have to dig into it, but there are other ways to see why this idea does not work in any way).

Personally, I love indirect proofs - because I think that if you could show that your philosophical adversary can't get rid of the concept/ or even presuppose the very concept he's trying to deny it's pretty much a good reason for knowing that it sure does exist and its a real thing. That's exactly the case of nominalism i.e it needs universals to even get off the ground!!      For example, when we (realists about universals) see a red thing and another one, it's pretty damn obvious that they share the exact same thing i.e redness even though they are different in other aspects. The nominalist will, of course, deny this fact. He's gonna say that ""it's not the same redness"" and that universals are ""free creations of the human mind to facilitate speaking"". But the basic problem that affects every single version of this idea is the fact the communication itself (i.e the proposition, the speech, the way he talks to other people) presupposes the very universals he's trying to deny and the fact that the conventional use or creation of things itself presuppose objective realities (just like to know what's an illusion or falsity itself presuppose a grasp of what truth is - it's a parasitic thing).      So, we are human beings and WE DO entertain concepts. Of course, if Agnetha Falstkog is prettier than Olivia Newton-John or if Brazilian BBQ is better than feijoada is a matter of opinion, it's a subjective matter. But the point is, we do entertain universal concepts that not just must be but ARE the very same concepts that you and I must entertain and they are, by their very nature, objective. One simple example is mathematics. When I think about the Pythagorean theorem or the number 7 and you think the very same thing it's simply impossible for them to be different things i.e if someone understands the Pythagorean theorem at all - or Bhaskara or whatever - it is the same thing that we are talking about. It's not like you are entertaining your private concept of the Pythagorean theorem and I am entertaining mine because if it was really that way communication would be impossible.      Consider science, for example. It is in the business of discovering the world around us - at least it should if not impregnated with ideology. But if scientists were not talking about atoms, electrons, spins, or whatever in a universal graspable manner i.e IN THE VERY SAME MANNER then we could only have particular concepts (that one shared by this scientist and another one shared by that other scientist) and we could not even be talking about the same thing - or discovering - the same thing. In short, realism is the only theory that does not turn scientific founding into a miracle - to paraphrase Hillary Putnam.      Of course, Ed goes through reasons why we should reject this by a lot of different arguments, but I tried to sum up everything so you could understand better. There are a lot of other examples and vicious regress lurking nominalism and other arguments showing how they presuppose universals instead of getting rid of the body.

It cannot be compared to the the Oecumenical Councils or ex cathedra statements.

Michael Miller, _The Shepherd and the Rock: Origins, Development, and Mission of the Papacy_ , at p. 292). Now, to sin against the faith would be to teach error on some matter of faith or morals. Hence Innocent III was teaching that it is possible for such error to occur (when a pope is not teaching in a definitive way). Here Innocent was simply acknowledging a principle already recognized in Gratian’s codification of canon law, and as Christian Washburn has noted in [a recent article](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/761039), two later popes (Innocent IV and Paul IV) made similar statements.",saw walford regan appeal statement pope innocent iii defense position particular pope also taught something point precisely opposite direction said “ account sin committed faith judged church ” quoted j michael miller shepherd rock origin development mission papacy p sin faith would teach error matter faith moral hence innocent iii teaching possible error occur pope teaching definitive way innocent simply acknowledging principle already recognized codification canon law christian washburn noted recent articlehttpsmusejhueduarticle two later pope innocent iv paul iv made similar statement,feser,916,0

1886,"The bishop's office of ""teacher"" is not exercised ONLY when he _expressly_ ""intends to bind the faithful"" in an _unreserved_ way, for a bishop _cannot_ bind the faithful in that way because he is not infallible. But he still exercises the office of teacher when he teaches in such a way that he expects his people to hear _and receive and be guided by_ his teaching. This is what the magisterial office _means_. The pope, in exercising his _ordinary_ office of bishop of Rome, exercises the same magisterial authority as any bishop does. But by being the pope, his teaching acts also teach the whole world. It is impossible for him to teach ""just Rome"" and not implicitly teach to the world.      Just as is true of ALL the bishops, who teach their teachings in various **degrees** of definitude by which they intend others to receive them, so also does the pope. When he indicates, by details such as formality of venue, tone of voice, and declarative mood, that a teaching is more definitive than usual, we are obliged to give it a greater degree of respect, (i.e. to assent to it with less _reserve_ than usual). As a result of these truths, it will be automatically the case that when the pope wishes to be _especially_ definitive, he will typically be doing so especially _to the world_. But even THERE, he has degrees available: if the pope gives a speech to an international forum of obstetricians and speaks there about the immorality of certain tubal ligations (as contraceptive), it is inevitable that he be speaking broadly to the whole world, in that those doctors are from the whole world and will repeat his teaching around the world. But the venue is not as _formal_ as an encyclical, and so has a lesser degree of definitude - lesser sense that he ""intends to bind"" - as to that aspect. The intention he has is CAPABLE OF DEGREE. Hence the deference we give it must be capable of degree.      Once we realize that religious assent - the kind of assent that is not the ""unreserved"" assent given to infallible teachings - is **reserved** assent, we must realize that it comes in many flavors just as do the reservations by which it is not **UN** reserved. And the _intention to bind_ is also present in many degrees.",office teacher exercised expressly intends bind faithful unreserved way bishop bind faithful way infallible still exercise office teacher teach way expects people hear receive guided teaching magisterial office mean pope exercising ordinary office bishop rome exercise magisterial authority bishop pope teaching act also teach whole world impossible teach rome implicitly teach world true bishop teach teaching various degree definitude intend others receive also pope indicates detail formality venue tone voice declarative mood teaching definitive usual obliged give greater degree respect ie assent le reserve usual result truth automatically case pope wish especially definitive typically especially world even degree available pope give speech international forum obstetrician speaks immorality certain tubal ligation contraceptive inevitable speaking broadly whole world doctor whole world repeat teaching around world venue formal encyclical lesser degree definitude - lesser sense intends bind - aspect intention capable degree hence deference give must capable degree realize religious assent - kind assent unreserved assent given infallible teaching - reserved assent must realize come many flavor reservation un reserved intention bind also present many degree,feser,2230,0

Davis’ “solution” to the schism: “Both the Orthodox and the Catholics would call the pope the primus inter pares. What’s more, everywhere I look now, I see signs that traditional Catholics are moving closer toward the Orthodox position (in a good way)” Perhaps if he left the Vigano/Pietro Siffi cheer squad, his adoring eyes would see something else – there are more than a billion Catholics out there after all. But then, he doesn’t believe there are any doctrinal differences with non-Catholic Orthodoxy (revealing his own lack of orthodoxy), claiming it’s just to do with the way we “do” theology.      He says the Catholic Church is better than the Orthodox in that it is less “ethnic”, but could not resist this: “I did once get some dirty looks for showing up at a Spanish-language Mass in a D.C. ghetto”. Vile. What a way to speak of the Church that welcomed him a few years ago; this “ghetto” of Hispanic Catholicism now includes most US Catholics. What goes on in their parishes is culturally speaking, a window into 1960s liberal US Catholicism.      Yes, as he finds the Catholic Church stinky, exotic folk-religion and “decentralised” local churches are a greener grass. What he can’t explain is how, since the vast majority of “local” churches are pretty liberal, giving them “autonomy” will result in the restoration of orthodox Catholicism. The answer would be obvious to any normal Catholic: pray and work for the re- emergence of the Papacy that has overseen the years of glories he dismisses as “300 years” of “ultramontanism”.

2183,"@Walter      You are only different after the decision, not before. The decision is itself a self-determination to a possibility. The self-determination does not exist until actually willed. Hence why it is free. We can conceive different outcomes because the determination is not there until it is there; there is a real sense in which the agent creates the determination. This is the reason I emphasized simultaneous agent causation as well as equivocal causation. Event causation gets you a vicious regress or no real decision at all.      As far as ""randomness"" goes, that would only hold if you assume the outcomes already have some nascent individually determinate reality that are coin flipped between, which is not the case here; moreover the possibilities considered altogether can also be viewed as a region that an agent's individual determinations are bounded by.      Further, a distribution of an agent's decisions does not tell you by what means they come about. Heads on a coin flip is not determined by P(H)=0.5. It's determined by the physics of an actual flip; P(H) tends to 0.5 given the symmetry of a coin.      With respect to an agent, given their beliefs and their character you can have a rough idea of how they will act; but that would just constitute the boundaries of decisions, not the actual act of self-determination itself.      The relevance to divine simplicity is quite clear since this issue is integral to analogously understanding God's will and freedom in relation to modal collapse.      @JoeD      The objection begs the question. The choice does not exist in the agent somehow that is then univocally transmitted into the outcome, which is what the objection requires.      The choice is in fact created in a certain sense and reflects a way the agent can self determine. Prior to the choice there is nothing and no self- determination. There is no contrastive otherwise possible here. Hence the actual free willing is sufficient to explain the choice because it is coincident with the choice. Self-determination is something like marking off a number in a continuous region, not picking a stone out of a discrete pile of stones. The determination and the decision are one in the same thing, not two events, and so the sui generis willings are relevantly explanatory.",walter different decision decision self-determination possibility self-determination exist actually willed hence free conceive different outcome determination real sense agent creates determination reason emphasized simultaneous agent causation well equivocal causation event causation get vicious regress real decision far randomness go would hold assume outcome already nascent individually determinate reality coin flipped case moreover possibility considered altogether also viewed region individual determination bounded distribution decision tell mean come head coin flip determined ph determined physic actual flip ph tends given symmetry coin respect agent given belief character rough idea act would constitute boundary decision actual act self-determination relevance divine simplicity quite clear since issue integral analogously understanding freedom relation modal collapse joed objection begs question choice exist agent somehow univocally transmitted outcome objection requires choice fact created certain sense reflects way agent self determine prior choice nothing self- determination contrastive otherwise possible hence actual free willing sufficient explain choice coincident choice self-determination something like marking number continuous region picking stone discrete pile stone determination decision one thing two event sui generis willing relevantly explanatory,feser,2309,0
3927,"""That requires an external authority to assign the interpretation to the text.""      Of course, that it is the point of any non-Protestant church (or, if you want, any religion or ideology with exception of the ones derived from Protestantism). In USA, there is an external authority to interpret the Constitution: it is called ""the Supreme Court"".      Texts don't interpret themselves and don't have any meaning before interpretation: they are only ink on a paper or pixels on a screen before humans interpret them. To prevent differences of interpretation, Jesus gave the authoritative interpretation to the apostles: this was the point of Jesus telling his disciples that they had to learn more things but he was going to send the Spirit to teach them.      ""Judaism has a prayer titled ""Elohai Neshamah"" that specifically asserts that you were created pure, unadulterated, and whole as a baby. ""      Rabbinical Judaism is a different religion than Biblical Judaism so recurring to a Rabbinical prayer is not a piece of evidence. Rabbinical Judaism is built as a reaction against Christianity.      Let's look at Biblical Judaism: ""Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me."" (Psalm 51, 5).      This is much earlier than a Rabbinical prayer. Rabbinical Judaism contradicts the Hebrew Bible in many things. In the Talmud, Rabbis are given authority of interpretation even higher than God. When God disagrees on an interpretation, a Rabbi says that God has no authority after he gave the Law at Mount Sinai. Of course, this is completely alien to the spirit of the Hebrew Bible.      ""Literally speaking, the Greek words for ""original sin"" or ""concupiscience"" do not appear anywhere in Romans.""      Yes, the Greek word for Trinity does not appear literally in the entire New Testament. Only that there is a Father, a Son and a Spirit and that the three are God and there is an only God. But ""Trinity""? Not once.      The original sin is not explicit in the Old Testament but saying that it was an invention of Saint Augustine is an exaggeration. Besides hints at Genesis and in the Psalms, we have some sayings of Jesus      ""When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved? Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.” (Matthew 19, 25-26)      There is Romans and there is the fact that man cannot save himself so he needs a Savior.      Yes, Augustine developed the doctrine of original sin and the Church (inspired by the Spirit) adopted it, as an authoritative interpretation. This is similar to other doctrines, such as the Trinity. Development of doctrine is the explicit clarification of doctrines that were implicit.

3697,"Tom,   If you change weight are you still you? Do you ""retain your identifying properties"" when a gram of water evaporates from your skin?      Indeed, are you precisely the same at all moment to moment? Clearly, no.      Is one apple precisely the same as another apple? Of course not, so, in that case, what sense does it make to count apples, since no two apples are precisely the same?      The identification of a sort of thing is always a bit fuzzy, so we approximate to classify and consider certain sorts of objects to be members of a set when their ""identifying properties"" fall within some range established by convention.      In chemistry the convention is that the number of protons in the nucleus determines which element the atom is called. Atoms of the same sort can vary over a wide variety of parameters, even the number of neutrons in the nucleus, and they are still called, by convention, a particular element name.      Hylomorphism: stuff can change but stuff can only change into stuff that it can change to and it can't change to stuff it can't change to. This is what Thomists consider some grand profound insight?      Such trivial, tautological truths are what remain of A-T in modern science.

As an ex-atheist, I know that whether you believe in God as the ground of being (as all real believers do), versus considering Him as “a being” (as most atheists do) affects so much of your perspective. It’s not a fact among other facts. The reality is more like our understanding is a wall, with boxed up bricks of conclusions. As humans we find it difficult to look at the contents of more than one brick at a time. From an evolutionary perspective this is understandable. When you need food, or there is a lion at the cave entrance, you don’t want to be thinking about ways to make clothes, how the sun moves through the sky etc. In the modern world the foundations of the wall tend to be physics, chemistry, maths, geology, economics, politics etc, which themselves have foundations built on a reduction to small things (pebbles). Once you believe in God, that is always the foundation stone. To me this is why literalist, fundamentalist protestants have such a problem with science, but that’s a different subject. However it’s also why people find the conversion experience so shocking, as you realise your wall of understanding is in many cases upside down.

Because for materialists in the technical sense - if they are to be coherent at all - they should say that people do not exist. But in the buddhist sense, not only people do not exist and there is just suffering but the world is always trying to deceive you. I don't need to canvas it more for you to see how much worse it is. There is simply no happiness at all and no one to see any good of it. It seems that ideology takes all of the best in the world and turn it into misery.      In the cellphone example, they somehow believe in regularities but, as far as I understand, they are very close to the Humean causality type - or proto- humean. They say that causality is in some sense mind only or something we 'associate' but it's in some sense not really there (I think that's somehow related to why they are nominalists too). If this is coherent at the end of the day (I think that it's not) is another story - and that's what I want to know because something as evil as that CAN'T BE REAL.      During these years I tried to formulate ways in showing how that can't be true - I will put them in the other post. But man the problem is even if I somehow 'showed' that, I can't prove it to myself. You may think how that's possible but the problem is the OCD - this thing keeps hitting my head 24/7 and it seems that I can't go further. Since you don't have it I can describe that it hits differently. Looks like my arguments are always wrong or that they will have somehow a way to evade it. For people that do not have it, it seems ridiculous, but for me, it hits really hard to the point that doesn't matter how I try to formulate it, and I always forget the rest of the arguments and need to repeat them to myself. It looks like hell because I'm never out of the same place and looks like I learn nothing - just keep suffering.      I will try to formulate all the points that give me hope that demonic ideology (buddhism) is wrong in the open-topic post. I will try to put my best in there and try to be coherent all the way through.

Because, as history is demonstrably informing us the hegemony of Catholic thought will continue to downsize in the public square due to its ever- decreasing significance and relevance in addressing the existential challenges in contemporary society. People are shedding the skin of catholic thought, not because it is wrong, but because it does not represent a comprehensive, let alone a universally acknowledged course in navigating the complex nature of modern life and its eclectic demands. It's a wishful throw-back to the 'good- old' days, to simpler times.      All of Feser's bogeymen, the most feared catholic demons are there: Marxism, postmodernism, liberation theology, and CRT. And Feser's manufactured rendition of CRT is intellectually and philosophically mistaken.

It is egregiously misplaced for Dr Feser to argue from a perspective that is entirely unfounded.

The dozen or so States that have legislated against the 'teaching of CRT' in schools, banning books and curricular material across the country is the stuff of authoritarianism, not of democracies. It is nothing less than a cynical and forlorn attempt not only at erasing a somewhat sorry chapter in human relations but equally, the wholesale whitewashing of American history.

Schmid explains:       _God’s act of will is based on that self-same intrinsic goodness that is identical to God. This seems to be a far cry from a reason for creating, let alone a reason for creating this particular universe (as opposed to some other possible universe)._      This just strikes me as odd. Schmid and Mullins seem to argue that God’s reasoning in some way parallels ours, but we have not the slightest clue how the mind of God works. If the arguments for divine impassibility are successful, then God is impassible regardless our inability to figure out how simplicity can be maintained when we consider creation. If the DDI is false, then arguments should be provided to show the inferential mistakes therein.      Moreover, Mullins’ “proposals” are nothing but finite attempts at figuring out how creation is compatible with “reason.” And since Mullins cannot come up with a good reason for creation, DDI (the doctrine of divine impassibility) must be false. But this of course does not follow. It’s akin to arguments for the logical Problem of Evil. The fact that we cannot figure out a good reason for evil does not mean that one doesn’t exist. So long as it is logically possible that there is a morally justifiable reason for allowing evil, then evil cannot be used as evidence against God. And this also works the other way with transcendental arguments for God. The fact that God is the best explanation for rationality does not mean, in itself, that God exists. Spontaneous generation was at one the time the “best” explanation for the appearance of worms in rotting meat, but we discovered that it was neither best nor true. Thus, our apparent inability to come up with a reason for creation that is consistent with DDI does not mean that one doesn’t exist. Mullins should stick with attacking the arguments for DDI instead of engaging in vain attempts at understanding the divine mind.      I realize that this smacks of unprincipled mysterianism, but it’s just the opposite. An unsuccessful argument cannot be held together by an appeal to mystery. That would be unprincipled. But if an argument is sound, we cannot reasonably discard it based on our inability to figure out some of its consequences. For example, I believe the arguments for _creatio ex nihilo_ are convincing, but I don’t have a sweet clue how God did it. There are times when I find it an interesting mental exercise, but at the end of the road I’m always baffled. That doesn’t shake my confidence in the legitimacy of the argument; it just shows the limitation of my knowledge. Finite minds cannot comprehend an infinite mind, so it’s pointless to try. Likewise, I’m perfectly happy with the mystery of creation because the arguments for simplicity are solid.

Russell did not bother to address Aristotle by name in that piece, he found reading and explaining the ancient philosophers of physics to be very tedious, as he found that scarcely a sentence they wrote was correct.      His aim was to discuss modern physics as it was known at that time and to reject the common notion of causality.      One example he used for his description of mutual interaction, as opposed to the ancient notion of hierarchical cause and effect, was gravity, possibly because that example is intuitively familiar to many.

4285,"@ Walter Van den Acker,      I am not able to say much now because we have an apparently frozen septic field and brown water in our basement. We may even have to move into a hotel for a while.      ""If a random number contains it if it's long enough then it obviously can be reduced to a random number.""      If you regard it as nothing but a random sequence, sure, it's nothing but a random sequence. But regarded as a model or image of a mind, it's more than that. Regarded as a simple image of God, it is hidden from us, it contains everything expressible, finite or infinite, within the limits of the model (e.g., it is not a sequence of real numbers, etc.), and it is indeterminate so that a human mind may or may not find something in it as the XOR process shows. You should regard computation to a computer's output devices similarly as a model of a human mind as impacted by the sequence.      By ""indeterminate"" I mean something _like_ that it is not a specific random sequence but something _like_ that it is all of them superimposed. The XOR process and the discussion about how _predetermined_ meaning could be anything even though the sequence is random illustrates that. You see, it is not the specificity of a particular sequence that matters. It is that it is random. The randomness is not a bug. It is a feature of the model.      A random sequence can be generated by a physical process according to quantum physics, at least a finite random sequence can, but as the output of an observed nuclear decay interval sequence or something like that, it is indeed just a random sequence with no further meaning. That process just shows that there is such a thing as what we can call a random sequence.      Mathematicians find the idea hard or impossible even to define from pure mathematical ideas. A definition is a rule and a rule defeats randomness. As a _model_ of a real mind, however, the model mind's process as a non-specified random sequence imbues it with meaning. I can't say that the model is a specific observed nuclear decay interval sequence, but the XOR process shows how such a non-specific number could work. Nuclear decay intervals cannot generate infinite random sequences either. I just have to assume the existence of infinite random sequences.      ""Nor do I see the relevance of 'the impossibility of knowing what agents with free will will do that will convert their mental phenomena into tangible acts.'""      Forget that paragraph.

The right wing version is that immigrants, especially immigrants of color, outbreed people who were born in the country, so that descendants of the former will “replace” descendants of the latter. This is supposed to be bad.      The left wing version is that immigrants, especially immigrants of color, trend more to the left than people who were born in the country, so that leftists will “replace” conservatives.

As to the latter version: Immigrants who are acquainted with the politics of the country are often quite conservative; they don’t want to lose what they’ve worked and suffered to attain.

The issue here is whether the teaching of the Popes (outside an ex cathedra or Conciliar declaration) is different to that of the Bishops, not the quality of our assent. The Pope's teaching is different, because the Bishop of Rome is the successor of St. Peter, and therefore bishop of Rome, which will never deviate from the faith (Pius IX), has personal guarantees of faith from our Lord that were used at the Vatican I definition, and the Pope's jurisdiction is the source of each bishop's jurisdiction and authority - they are not autonomous. The relation between the Pope and other bishops is much more lopsided that that between St. Peter and the Apostles.      The Pope inherits Christ's promise to St. Peter that his faith will not fail.

1445,"I have never heard of any **authoritative** assertion that an abused wife _should_ stay with the husband, and especially not say it as if it represented a rule. Adrian Fonseca is just a news & commentary purveyor, has no authority to hold forth on ""a teaching"". So, absent any new datum, it's ""just some guy bloviating"". Like me, here.      The Chrisitan doctrine on suffering is multi-layered, and should not be reduced to a simple sentence. That said, 4 points are at the heart: (1) not all suffering can be avoided while staying on the right side of the line of good action. (2) When suffering _can_ be avoided by a morally licit choice, it is often prudent (i.e. good, right action) to so. (3) In spite of (2), there are ALSO many situations where some part of suffering can be avoided, but willingly taking on and accepting the suffering (taking the suffering yourself, not subjecting another to the suffering) can be spiritually valuable, and **in general** a good Christian should expect to accept AT LEAST SOME avoidable suffering along his life. (4) Accepting avoidable suffering is _never_ done for its own sake, and therefore it can generally be accounted as being accepted for some other thing, a good that (will) more than offset the evil suffered. This is not intrinsically different from doing (troublesome) exercise to make the body (and soul) stronger - and there is little debate about that kind of ""accepting suffering"".      Infinite_Growth appears to be a moral toddler who has just discovered the word ""no"". Indeed, there is much room for growth.      So to apply: there is no possible one-size-fits-all rule for abused women. For some few (if the abuse is not severe), maybe they can achieve more good in the long run by staying. Maybe. For others, they have few or no real alternatives.

Wow, infinite growth. You are quite the wizard with your knowledge of both Church history and exegesis of Scripture and the internal state of every Catholic on the planet. Apparently you have arrived and all of us wayward Catholics just need to give up and stop trying. What a quaint little idea.      Regarding your expertise in the inward working of every Catholic on the planet: how did you arrive at such expansive knowledge? Ah, the bible (as interpreted by my Protestant instructors) tells me so. Yet another quaint little idea.      Quoting Romans 7:7-8 tells you precisely zero about whether or not every Catholic in the world is unrepentant. You are just reading into the bible your own foregone conclusions which stem from a heretic who invented a novel teaching on justification in the 1500s. And before you make assumption that Catholics just don't know their Scripture, I have translated the Pentateuch from the Hebrew of the Masoretic Text and the Greek of the LXX and have translated the entire new testament including Romans. The text you are quoting does precisely nothing to support your Protestant novelties and you are simply reading into it your own foregone conclusions.      You suggest that we should not make effort in regards to salvation and read that into Romans. Well that suggestion would be news to Paul who wrote that we must ""work out our salvation with fear and trembling."" No smug Protestant assurance in St. Paul.      Regarding the false dichotomy that we either don't try and recognize that God saves us or we try our best and think that we save ourselves; this sad Protestant trope has nothing to do with the Bible and Apostolic Christianity which affirms that we must work out our salvation with fear and trembling and that God brings about our salvation through grace. The conjunction of those two things is what the bible teaches and you pit them against one another because you are steeped in Protestantism which originated in a denial of secondary causality.      Figures like St. Augustine and St. Thomas demonstrated how these two things work together without contradiction. This was recognized by the Church Fathers none of whom held to the opinions that were invented by Luther in the 1500s.

3234," _1) Yes it was an act of the Magisterium, even from the Pope himself, thus 2) Therefore the Magisterium is not protected even from heresy in its ordinary teachings._      What, specifically, makes you phrase the second as ""not protected from _heresy_?""      We know that the Church's fallible teachings (I.e. those which were not taught infallibly) are ""not **absolutely** protected"" from ERROR, in that fallible teachings are reformable and might eventually be reformed because they were wrong and needed to be corrected.      But one cannot conclude from this that the Church's fallible teachings are therefore _utterly_ not protected from error, i.e. that there is simply NOTHING that limits how much error they have. That doesn't follow. As I understand it, the Church says of these teachings that they, too, are influenced by the Holy Spirit, in a lesser way, such that the Church will not fall into such error (on non-infallible teachings) that she _lastingly_ leads Christians into grave error that endangers their souls. These criteria are inherently difficult to apply to particular cases, but the basic _idea_ is that, like situation where the Holy Spirit's action by which He molds the teachings of the many bishops so that they (without formal collusion) all teach the same thing so that it becomes an infallible teaching, so also at other times He molds their teaching so that where one or some are in error, others are not, or at least not gravely and for long. This is indeed a protection, afforded to _the Church_ , that does not protect from every error, rather from an error having a certain scale of effect.      Clearly the Arian heresy running rampant was an error _in the ranks of bishops_ so that they were teaching error, but it never swallowed the entire episcopate. Since it is simply the case that the bishops who were Arians were teaching _wrongly_ by their _officially demanding_ belief in Arianism, and since the bishops certainly exercise their magisterial office when they teach in an official capacity in such wise as to insist on and require assent, we know that ""the Magisterium can teach error"" _in at least that limited sense_ , don't we?",yes act magisterium even pope thus therefore magisterium protected even heresy ordinary teaching specifically make phrase second protected heresy know fallible teaching ie taught infallibly absolutely protected error fallible teaching reformable might eventually reformed wrong needed corrected one conclude fallible teaching therefore utterly protected error ie simply nothing limit much error follow understand church say teaching influenced holy spirit lesser way church fall error non-infallible teaching lastingly lead christian grave error endangers soul criterion inherently difficult apply particular case basic idea like situation holy action mold teaching many bishop without formal collusion teach thing becomes infallible teaching also time mold teaching one error others least gravely long indeed protection afforded church protect every error rather error certain scale effect clearly arian heresy running rampant error rank bishop teaching error never swallowed entire episcopate since simply case bishop arians teaching wrongly officially demanding belief arianism since bishop certainly exercise magisterial office teach official capacity wise insist require assent know magisterium teach error least limited sense,feser,2176,0
438,"1) You can indeed seek something for its own sake while also seeking it for the sake of something else, but that implies there are two motives properly distinct from the other; and one could then perhaps say that what defines the motive of seeking something for its own sake is to not seek it for the sake of something else AND to seek it for the intrinsic value it has. This motive, having such a structure, would still be properly distinct from the other motive which DOES seek something for the sake of something else.      2) So about seeking a thing of intrinsic value instrumentally, I think this just reifies (or is that the wrong word to use?) or reduces the intrinic value of a thing to just a means - you could literally just replace it and have the rich man tell you he's gonna give you much money if you find something completely red today.      The redness in this case, just like the intrinsic value in the other, is just an identifier that you're looking for in order to gain something else. So I think there's a confusion of meaning going on when someone says they pursue X because of the intrinsic value it has. One could take this in an instrumental sense, or one could instead take this in a sense similar to how one loves others for their own sake, or oneself for one's own sake.      When one seeks the good of another person for the other's own sake, I guess one is thereby recognising the intrinsic axiology or value-ness of the person and doing the action on the basis of that.      One sees the value of the other and recognises that benefitting the other person itself, taking the person as the end because they're valuable simply as such (axiologically I guess?) is good. So benefitting them is just intrinsically worth seeking of itself, with the end being the person, and the grounds being the value & worth of the person properly distinct from any other end.         3) As for achieving X for the sake of Y, I think the person doing the achieving is also crucial. For the person wanting to achieve X for the sake of Y, Y is the final cause of **their achieving** X, not X by itself simpliciter.      So it seems one could say that, for the person wanting to achieve X, if he wanted to do this for its own sake, he'd be taking X as the final cause of the very achieving itself, or the seekig to achieve. There's no problem in taking X as the final cause of itself then, since it's not about a final cause inhering in X itself.         4) I'd also love to know the difference between seeking X for X's sake and seeking it for its own sake, because those two seem identical to me - what is ""its own sake"" in regards to X? How could it not be, well.....X itself? Since the ""own"" is self-referential to X?

So it seems that, if taken at face value, he is saying that God could turn the stones into literal, biological descendants of Abraham.

33,"In a just defensive war, to refuse to fight to defend one’s fellow citizens without special reason (perhaps priests and doctors should not kill) is wrong. But a grave harm is done to a conscientious objector who is gotten to fight by legal incentives. Let’s think through the five considerations above. The first mainly applies to laws prohibiting a behavior rather than ones requiring a behavior. Short of brainwashing, it is impossible to _make_ someone fight. (We could superglue their hands to a gun, and then administer electric shocks causing their fingers to spasm and fire a bullet, but that wouldn’t count as _fighting_.) The second applies somewhat: we do need to weigh the harms to innocent citizens from enemy invaders, harms that might be prevented if our conscientious objector fought. But note that there is something rather speculative about these harms. Someone who fights contrary to conscience is unlikely to be a very effective fighter, and it is far from clear that their military activity would actually prevent any actual harm to innocents. Now, regarding the third consideration, one can design a conscription law with an exemption that few who aren’t conscientious objectors would take advantage of. One way to do this is to require evidence of one’s conscience’s objection to fighting (e.g., prior membership in a pacifist organization). Another way is to impose non-combat duties on conscientious objectors that are as onerous and maybe as dangerous as combat would be. Regarding the fourth consideration, it seems unlikely that a typical conscientious objector’s objections to war would be changed by legal penalties. And the fifth seems a weak consideration in general. Putting all these together, we do not outweigh the _prima facie_ considerations against pressuring conscientious objectors to act against their (mistaken) conscience from the harms in going against conscience.",defensive war refuse fight defend fellow citizen without special reason perhaps priest doctor kill wrong grave harm done conscientious objector gotten fight legal incentive think five consideration first mainly applies law prohibiting behavior rather one requiring behavior short brainwashing impossible make someone fight could superglue hand gun administer electric shock causing finger spasm fire bullet count fighting second applies somewhat need weigh harm innocent citizen enemy invader harm might prevented conscientious objector fought note something rather speculative harm someone fight contrary conscience unlikely effective fighter far clear military activity would actually prevent actual harm innocent regarding third consideration one design conscription law exemption conscientious objector would take advantage one way require evidence objection fighting eg prior membership pacifist organization another way impose non-combat duty conscientious objector onerous maybe dangerous combat would regarding fourth consideration seems unlikely typical conscientious objection war would changed legal penalty fifth seems weak consideration general putting together outweigh prima facie consideration pressuring conscientious objector act mistaken conscience harm going conscience,pruss,1908,1
3710,"Not a fan   Indeed, ""Aristotle Was Not Wrong about Everything"". Is that a reasonable basis to be an Aristotelian? Not wrong about everything?      Even where his conclusions were wrong Aristotle made great progress by engaging in a process of observation, organization of data, and publishing his reasoning for his theories.      Unfortunately, Aristotle was pretty much all wrong about physics. About all he got right were a few trivial observations. Modern physics has falsified Aristotelian physics, and therefore the First Way of Aquinas, which is based on Aristotelian physics.      The Aristotelian arguments for a first mover depend on the notion that motion requires an external mover in the present moment. Modern physics has scientifically falsified that notion, thus the First Way has been scientifically falsified. No amount of cherry-picked trivial associations between Aristotle and modern observations can alter the simple fact that the argument for a first mover is based on a fundamental error of Aristotle.      I am not familiar with your asserted unreasonable criticisms of Aristotelian logic by Bertrand Russel, fine, that is not what I was referring to with respect to the ways Russel pointed out the errors of Aristotle.      Russel provided further explanation as to why the Aristotelian argument for a first mover is wrong, especially in his writings about mutual interactions. Aquinas pointed to the need for successive movers which cannot rationally go to infinity, which is a very good point. What Russel explained is that movers do not regress in a linear hierarchy, rather, movers interact mutually in a circular mutual process, thus terminating finitely the regression of movers Aquinas called for.      In modern physics material is conserved, as expressed in the famous equation E=mc^2. Feser above calls for a first sustainer, yet modern physics and simple logic call for just the opposite. If X amount of material remains after time passes that is no change in the amount of existent material, therefore no first changer, no first sustainer, is called for.      Feser has this clear and simple logic back to front.      If material were to blink out of existence, then that would be a change calling for a changer. So, Feser seems to imagine an unseen changer continuously changing material back from spontaneously changing itself out of existence so that we observe no change.      Further, Feser has, from time to time, described this notion of material simply blinking out of existence absent a sustainer. Thus, Feser advocates that Aquinas was wrong in stating in the First Way ""It is therefore impossible that in the same respect and in the same way a thing should be both mover and moved, i.e. that it should move itself."" Clearly, if a material thing were to blink itself out of existence it would ""move"" (change) itself from existing to not existing.      Modern physics has scientifically falsified Aristotelian physics, thus, modern physics has falsified the Five Ways of Aquinas, which are based on Aristotelian (false) physics. Modern physics has scientifically falsified the A-T notions of a first sustainer, revealing such notions to be incoherent. Attempts by Koons and Feser to somehow find vindication of Aristotle in modern physics are confused, erroneous, and misguided at best.",fan indeed aristotle wrong everything reasonable basis aristotelian wrong everything even conclusion wrong aristotle made great progress engaging process observation organization data publishing reasoning theory unfortunately aristotle pretty much wrong physic got right trivial observation modern physic falsified aristotelian physic therefore first way aquinas based aristotelian physic aristotelian argument first mover depend notion motion requires external mover present moment modern physic scientifically falsified notion thus first way scientifically falsified amount cherry-picked trivial association aristotle modern observation alter simple fact argument first mover based fundamental error aristotle familiar asserted unreasonable criticism aristotelian logic bertrand russel fine referring respect way russel pointed error aristotle russel provided explanation aristotelian argument first mover wrong especially writing mutual interaction aquinas pointed need successive mover rationally go infinity good point russel explained mover regress linear hierarchy rather mover interact mutually circular mutual process thus terminating finitely regression mover aquinas called modern physic material conserved expressed famous equation emc feser call first sustainer yet modern physic simple logic call opposite x amount material remains time pass change amount existent material therefore first changer first sustainer called feser clear simple logic back front material blink existence would change calling changer feser seems imagine unseen changer continuously changing material back spontaneously changing existence observe change feser time time described notion material simply blinking existence absent sustainer thus feser advocate aquinas wrong stating first way therefore impossible respect way thing mover moved ie move clearly material thing blink existence would move change existing existing modern physic scientifically falsified aristotelian physic thus modern physic falsified five way aquinas based aristotelian false physic modern physic scientifically falsified a-t notion first sustainer revealing notion incoherent attempt koons feser somehow find vindication aristotle modern physic confused erroneous misguided best,feser,3332,0

The fact that the document requires the approval of the Pope indicates that it was read by the Pope and put out there with all the ensuing implications of the document influencing people. (A pope regarded to be one of the Church's greatest theologians)   What this does is imply that at the very least theological opinions expressed in the document are opinions that can be licitly held. I guess that one can say that other opinions were valid when Cardinal Ratzinger himself said limbo was just a hypothesis when he was head of the CDCF.      Ofcourse Limbo remains and will continue to remain a valid theological opinion. I have no qualms with that and I think it should be a valid opinion.

3814," _Insofar as metaphysics and religion both deal with matters that are not strictly evidentiary._      I can't say I agree with this hypothesis.      The sciences (all sciences, including the most firm and certain) all rely on _principles_ that they use in drawing conclusions. For instance, they all rely on principles of logic. You can't assert conclusions from experiments without using the principles of logic.      Philosophy provides some of those principles. Indeed, ""Philosophy of science"" is (or ought to be) considered a discipline that is foundational to the sciences. (And the discipline of logic is, itself, foundational to the philosophy of science, so it too is foundational to science.) The fact that _scientists_ often may be ignorant of the issues that trouble the prior disciplines doesn't mean that they are not USING the results of those disciplines, just as they might not bother to expend huge efforts on studying symbolic logic when they use principles of logic.      And the notion that the discipline of the philosophy of science is ""not evidentiary"" and therefore something lesser than ""science"" is just a non- starter: like the discipline of logic, science simply cannot function without the results handed to it by sound philosophy of science, and its **use of evidence** relies on sound philosophy of science. If one wishes to take all of philosophy as diminished in standing because it is ""non-evidentiary"", then one diminishes science itself.      Metaphysics, like logic, provides some of the underpinnings upon which the philosophy of science operates. You cannot have a sound philosophy of science with an unsound metaphysics in the background.      _Are religion and philosophy neighbors on the plane? It would seem so. They certainly are in university humanities departments, had you not noticed. And so, is religion philosophy? There is evidence of this. Belief, after Davidson, is a propositional attitude, and both religion and philosophy are propositional._      The fact that universities place ""religion"" and ""philosophy"" in the same boat is evidence, rather, that universities are operating on a BAD set of underlying positions regarding thought, knowledge, etc. For example, they treat propositions that _can't be proven_ and are held to be in contention to constitute ""matters for 'belief' rather than matters for 'knowledge"". But a proper understanding of metaphysics and knowledge allows for truths that can be known _without proof_ , i.e. first principles that can be known DIRECTLY rather than via a proof: self-evident principles. The rejection of this category by moderns is a _methodological_ mistake that causes the mistaken _assumption_ that ""philosophy"" is not about things that can be known, but only believed.      It would be just as coherent to say ""science is propositional, and rests on the _belief_ that we can rely on experimental evidence, therefore it is a belief system.""

2,"If we think that it’s never rational for a rational agent to refuse free information, then the above argument can be made rigorous to establish that any discontinuous rise in the epistemic value of credence at the point at which knowledge of a truth is reached is exactly mirrored by a discontinuous fall in the epistemic value of a state of credence where seeming-knowledge of a falsehood is reached. Moreover, the rise and the fall must be in the ratio 1 − _r_ : _r_ where _r_ is the knowledge threshold. Note that for knowledge, _r_ is plausibly pretty large, around 0.95 at least, and so the ratio between the special value of knowledge of a truth and the special disvalue of evidence- sufficient-for-knowledge for a falsehood will need to be at most 1:19. This kind of a ratio seems intuitively implausible to me. It seems unlikely that the special disvalue of evidence-sufficient-for-knowledge of a falsehood is an order of magnitude greater than the special value of knowledge.

The older understanding could still be seen as having a distinction between primary and secondary causes. However with the rediscovery of Aristotle in the west, the basis of the christian neoplatonic foundation of the past thousand years was slowly lost. In this the primary cause was naturally the divine idea(l)s of things, the eternal form towards which things unfolded in time. This was the basis of teleology which became uprooted after Oakham and even more so after the cartesian divide, where laws of nature (secondary causes) start to be seen as a kind of primary magic that acts on our abstraction of reality.

3750,"Dear @Rafa      It's been three years since I first met Ed's work and blog (in October of 2023, it will be 4!). I found his work (by chance) in the first place, but I must say that I am very, very grateful for this man's work. And it's not an overstatement to say that he saved and changed my life. I admire him so much - and I can affirm to you without hesitation that you will find his work very helpful throughout your life and philosophical inquiries.      Before going into recommending books and authors I must warn you to not get philosophical ideas over your head. Do not overthink them too much. That's friendly advice. I have OCD and I must say that's a nightmare. Just to give you a comparison, back when I was 15 to 16 years old and I learned more about nazism, and socialism (e.g the great purge, the massacres against the Jews; started reading about Solzhenitsyn and Alexander Bezmenov, for example) I thought that nothing could be worse than all of that but - for my unfortunate surprise - there are philosophical ideas that can be very harmful too (for example, eliminativism, reductionism, anti-realism about persons) and they are simply difficult, at least for me, to get it out of my head - not because they are soo much convincing but because they are bizarre with even bizarre consequences and if you got to them off-guard and have OCD or the like, you will suffer with this. So, please, be very careful about it (even if you do not have any kind of psychological disease).      There are a lot of things that I learned through all these years but you must note that I am NOT, in any important sense, an authority or expert in the matter (and my OCD blurs a lot of what I learned). First, to understand all of this right, I really think that Ed's work will be the best grounding for all of it. I do recommend you to read his book Aquinas (which I forgot to mention, but it's simply a very good book for beginners too!). You should also read his post's regarding Aristotelian-Thomistic Metaphysics to grasp everything better.      But there are, of course, works and philosophers that I do recommend you read - starting with the *easiest ones*: Mortimer J. Adler (Aristotle's for everyone, for example, and the collab book Thomistic Psychology ); William Norris Clarke (The one and the many); Richard Percival Philips (Modern Thomistic manual); Reginald Garigou-Lagrange (Reality: a synthesis); Desiré- Joseph Mercier (Manual of modern scholastic philosophy vol.1); Steve J. Jensen (The human person. A beginner's Thomistic psychology); and last - but not least - the amazing book written by Tomás Alvira, Luís Clavell, and Tomás Mellendo Granado (Metaphysics, but I do recommend you to read the English version of it for the very same reasons you should read the TLS in English).      The ones listed above are the *easiest* - or at least the most noob-friendly IMHO (that may be controversial and I am aware of that). There are, of course, other books that treat the matters more deeply but they are way, way harder to understand and I urge you to not dive into them - at least for now. Some examples are David Oderberg's (Real Essentialism) and Edward Jonathan Lowe (the possibility of metaphysics, for example). If you ever try to dive into them, I do recommend, of course, starting with Ed's work (especially Scholastic's Meta and Aristotle's Revenge - even though it's a book with difficult matters Ed makes a lot of it intelligible for laypeople) and Michael J.

Where intelligence is concerned, I am tempted to argue against incompossible goods either because intelligence isn't like that or for similar natural law reasons, but even more strongly, especially on account of the centrality of intelligence to humanity.      Consider your favorite déformation professionnelle, which, I submit, is more of a result of imprudence, habit, ignorance, lack of practice using other methods, and even effeminacy and arrogance. Someone with a rigorous philosophical education is less likely to try to pigeonhole reality into the reductive and simplified straitjacket of our physical models in the manner of at least some physicists who generally lack serious exposure to philosophy and may even hold it in contempt out of ignorance. A physicist may also be tempted to pigeonhole simply because of pride; if he isn't any good at metaphysics, then his thoughts on a metaphysical subject matter aren't likely to be very valuable or interesting, and that stings the prideful man accustomed to feeling like a hotshot. There is also the threat of seeing one's own field put in its methodological place, so to speak, deflating any pretensions to the kind of ultimacy that metaphysics lays claim to. A competent physics may also derive greater pleasure from exercising his specialized competence and choose his methods simply on the basis of what feels good and now what is called for by a problem. So here the question resurfaces: is there an incompossibility between being a good physicist and a good metaphysician? I suspect there isn't intrinsically, even if that is often the case which I suspect is rather a result of how one's time is spent. But even if it is the case, because general knowledge is superior and more worthy of human attention than specialized knowledge, we could argue that competence in physics that occurs at the expense of philosophical depth is, in fact, a kind of failure to attain human excellence by failing to devote proportional attention and effort to the kinds of knowledge that are most essential, and in doing so, risking intellectual deformation in important and even necessary matters.",ive wondered incompossible good weightlifting reduce agility example tall great basketball good weightlifting various niche seem exist raise question perfect human consists however perfection merely accidental sense exploit normatively speaking relation human nature flaw know sport actually bad human body neglect overall health body certain perfection seem perfection analogical sense perhaps something along line good thief effective deceiver intelligence concerned tempted argue incompossible good either intelligence like similar natural law reason even strongly especially account centrality intelligence humanity consider favorite déformation professionnelle submit result imprudence habit ignorance lack practice using method even effeminacy arrogance someone rigorous philosophical education le likely try pigeonhole reality reductive simplified straitjacket physical model manner least physicist generally lack serious exposure philosophy may even hold contempt ignorance physicist may also tempted pigeonhole simply pride good metaphysics thought metaphysical subject matter likely valuable interesting sting prideful man accustomed feeling like hotshot also threat seeing field put methodological place speak deflating pretension kind ultimacy metaphysics lay claim competent physic may also derive greater pleasure exercising specialized competence choose method simply basis feel good called problem question resurfaces incompossibility good physicist good metaphysician suspect intrinsically even often case suspect rather result time spent even case general knowledge superior worthy human attention specialized knowledge could argue competence physic occurs expense philosophical depth fact kind failure attain human excellence failing devote proportional attention effort kind knowledge essential risking intellectual deformation important even necessary matter,pruss,2844,1

1959,"Dr. Feser, respectfully, you make a clear error here. The council being wrong about Honorious being a heretic would be an error in a judgment of historical fact, not a matter of faith and morals. The matter of faith and morals would be the judgment of monothelitism as heresy, which is entirely true and accurate; whether or not Honorious was a heretic is a matter of historical fact and judgment, and the Council is not and never has been stated to be protected on questions of that kind. You claim that judging Honorious to be a heretic is a matter of faith and morals, but this is wrong; the matter of faith and morals is the condemnation of the *teaching* as heresy. If a judgment of an individual as a heretic was protected infallibly, excommunications could not be lifted years after someone's death, yet this happens all the time.      If Honorious was using his authority as the Pope to teach - and I disagree that writing anything in a private letter rises to such authority, as when the Pope attempts to teach something to the universal church he addresses the Church directly - then Honorious cannot teach heresy. The reason is that we are obliged to give religious assent of will to anything a Pope teaches from the ordinary magisterium, and the Magisterium cannot bind us to sin.      Honorious was *possibly* a heretic by the standards the Councils were using at the time but absolutely *not* a heretic by the standards we use to judge heresy today, as monothelitism had not yet been definitively judged as false by the Church. If we were to call him a heretic in the way that Vatican I understands the term, we'd also have to call St. Thomas Aquinas a heretic for rejecting the Immaculate Conception.      So I disagree with your argument here. The Magisterium cannot teach heresy as understood by Vatican I's definitions of teach, heresy, and Magisterium, and Honorious did no such thing.",dr feser respectfully make clear error council wrong honorious heretic would error judgment historical fact matter faith moral matter faith moral would judgment monothelitism heresy entirely true accurate whether honorious heretic matter historical fact judgment council never stated protected question kind claim judging honorious heretic matter faith moral wrong matter faith moral condemnation teaching heresy judgment individual heretic protected infallibly excommunication could lifted year death yet happens time honorious using authority pope teach - disagree writing anything private letter rise authority pope attempt teach something universal church address church directly - honorious teach heresy reason obliged give religious assent anything pope teach ordinary magisterium magisterium bind u sin honorious possibly heretic standard council using time absolutely heretic standard use judge heresy today monothelitism yet definitively judged false church call heretic way vatican understands term also call st thomas aquinas heretic rejecting immaculate conception disagree argument magisterium teach heresy understood vatican definition teach heresy magisterium honorious thing,feser,1904,0

But his beliefs don't change.      Although a God who changed with and experienced time such that his beliefs also changed might be thus considered complex across time by having temporal parts, that would seem to be assuming an A-theory of time for all (including God), then importing a B perspective at the end, incoherently. So, simplicity of essence (at any point in time) and atemporality could be distinguished I suppose, such that a person could affirm both simplicity and temporality of God.

3687,"Tom (cont.),   ""As for ""Carrasquillo"", I don't much care what he says.""   Feser provides a link to his work on the right side column of resources on this site, Ite ad Thomam. If you were to study his syllogistic interpretation of the First Way you would likely gain knowledge into the structure of the logical arguments Aquinas employed.      ""I am sorry, but you do not seem to understand what their results say.""   Aside from the defects I have previously demonstrated the First Way is also logically invalid as an argument for the necessity of the first mover in that it employs the logical fallacy of false dichotomy, namely that a thing must either move itself or inactively be moved by another. Aquinas crucially failed to account for the case where two objects, each incapable of moving themselves, have the ability to actively move each other. This mutual repulsion or mutual attraction is in fact how motion occurs at the most fundamental level. Macro examples abound, such as a rocket, which moves itself through space using the principle popularized as ""for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction"".      Thus, a gross error of Aquinas, one he certainly had access to in his time and glaringly failed to realize, is in this statement ""It is therefore impossible that in the same respect and in the same way a thing should be both mover and moved, i.e. that it should move itself.""      You move yourself even when you hold your breath. An underwater mammal is a clear example of an object that moves itself. Aquinas failed to realize this obvious fact.      Other examples of objects that move themselves abound, such as the aforementioned rocket, also a submarine boat, timed reactive device, battery operated clock, self drive electric vehicle, the sun and every other star, and on and on, making this error of Aquinas rather egregious.      At the base of these cases of objects that are in fact both mover and moved, that do in fact move themselves, is the mechanism of mutual motion of objects that otherwise cannot move themselves, say, two electrons, or an electron and a proton, each of which cannot move itself if alone in space, but can mutually move each other via the electrostatic force.

In this way, our application of abstractions is mediated by further abstractions. There are also the concrete _narratives_ by which all of these abstractions are made intelligible.

He also remained very appreciative of Henri De Lubac throughout his theological career, time as Pope and after retirement as well going as far as to mention him in a Papal Encyclical.      It was during his direction as Pope that the Vatican issued a definitive statement against Limbo, clearly declaring that it was not required.      All these indicate that the portrayals pf him as a watch dog or inquisitor were grossly exaggerated.

Are you overwhelmed by all the publicity from your singular brilliance? Is that the reason that you don't reveal your real name? Perhaps because we would all be overcome by your rock star status as a philosopher and theologian?      Let's see what widely renowned thinkers do I know that have the initials WCB? Ah, that's right. No one. That is the reason that you are not taken seriously here (anywhere?). That is the reason that Ya'kov referred to you as a ""notorious troll."" From my limited interaction with you, that description fits the bill quite neatly.      However, there is more that can be said and Tom Cohoe has said this well, ""Ever seeing and never perceiving."" That fits the bill quite well also.      But there is no doubt some spark within you that does not want to be an obnoxious troll who is under sad delusions of grandeur. Why not try to follow that spark? Why not stop pretending that you are clever when those around you are not fooled?      Regarding St. Augustine's argument, it addresses the point that God would know the state of the world at creation. After all God knows the state of the world past, present, and future, so despite your inept assertions otherwise, this point has not eluded theologians preceding nominalism or Luther or certainly not you. So why don't you stop pretending? It isn't fooling anyone.      The suggestion that St. Augustine abandoned his account of free will later in his career is a sad trope in older reformed Protestant theology. Your repetition of this sad trope shows that you are most certainly not familiar with the secondary literature on these issues. The account of the will found in his early Cassiacum Dialogues (On the Freedom of the Will) is maintained in his anti-Pelagian writings (e.g. On Grace and Free Will). It is also maintained in his City of God. Han Luen Kantzer Komline has traced St. Augustine on the will in Augustine on the Will: A Theological Account. This work makes clear that St. Augustine did not abandon and account on the Freedom of the Will. It really only takes a cursory reading of a few of St. Augustine's early and late works to realize this. In light of this, it is clear that you are familiar with neither St. Augustine nor the secondary literature on St. Augustine. So, again, who do you think you are fooling? Why keep pretending?      I would continue to expose the nonsense in your post, but I am left to wonder whether it would do any good in encouraging you to stop being a shameless pretender. Perhaps as a sign of goodwill, you might recognize that you have no clue what you are talking about with respect to St. Augustine. Then we can move on to other things that you have no clue about.

3793,"It's very silly to say that ""logic wasn't perfected until the 20th Century"". For one thing, it's a very broad field. I assume you're talking about the Predicate Calculus (PC), but this system is far from perfect, and in many ways is inferior to the traditional logic even without taking into account modern extensions such as that invented by philosopher Fred Sommers, among others.      The PC isn't user friendly because it's so far removed from natural language. Maybe that explains why it's hardly used except by a few computer scientists doing formal methods; it's certainly not used by mathematicians. Most of modern logic's ""innovations"" are very minor and consist mainly of ""mathematization"". Symbolization has its uses in terms of pattern finding, but it's been heavily overdone. Aristotle made the major conceptual breakthrough. There was simply no ""formal"" logic before him. In fact, logic is mostly studied as ""subject"" in its own right these days, usually an advanced topic in math classes, not as a tool to be used for seeking truth and evaluating arguments.      It's usually asserted that the old logic is inferentially weaker than the PC, which is why the syllogism is usually relegated to short chapter (for historical interest) in the textbooks, if it's even mentioned at all. This is simply not the case - it's a massive con. Sure, the traditional syllogism IS limited, but the basic principle of syllogistic, the ""Dictum de omni et nullo"" (namely subsumption and substitution) can be applied to many different kinds of arguments, including those containing propositions having complex and relational terms. There is nothing that the PC can do that syllogistic can't. On the other hand, syllogistic can efficiently and easily evaluate arguments that the PC finds extremely cumbersome and unwieldy, such as numerical arguments.      The context and agenda for the PC was the foundation of mathematics, which was in disarray at the time. It may be a good tool for that specialized application because its character is ""ontologically explicit"" insofar as it states clearly whether a given entity does or does not exist, but for everyday reasoning and philosophy, not so much.",silly say logic perfected th century one thing broad field assume talking predicate calculus pc system far perfect many way inferior traditional logic even without taking account modern extension invented philosopher fred sommers among others pc user friendly far removed natural language maybe explains hardly used except computer scientist formal method certainly used mathematician modern innovation minor consist mainly mathematization symbolization us term pattern finding heavily overdone aristotle made major conceptual breakthrough simply formal logic fact logic mostly studied subject right day usually advanced topic math class tool used seeking truth evaluating argument usually asserted old logic inferentially weaker pc syllogism usually relegated short chapter historical interest textbook even mentioned simply case - massive con sure traditional syllogism limited basic principle syllogistic dictum de omni et nullo namely subsumption substitution applied many different kind argument including containing proposition complex relational term nothing pc syllogistic hand syllogistic efficiently easily evaluate argument pc find extremely cumbersome unwieldy numerical argument context agenda pc foundation mathematics disarray time may good tool specialized application character ontologically explicit insofar state clearly whether given entity exist everyday reasoning philosophy much,feser,2192,0

2680,"The problem with this is that it contradicts the reader’s first statement, to the effect that creation adds nothing to God. For if God cannot be boundless in love without creating the world, then creation _does_ add something to God – it _completes_ or _perfects_ his love. This entails that God _needs creation_ in order to be complete, perfect, unlimited, unbounded. And this is no less heretical than is the claim that God creates of necessity. Thus does the First Vatican Council [teach that](https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/first-vatican-council-1505) “there is one true and living God, creator and lord of heaven and earth, almighty, eternal, immeasurable, incomprehensible, **_infinite in_** will, understanding and **_every perfection_** ” (emphasis added).  Of course, Hart would not be moved by the pronouncements of a Catholic council, but the doctrine is grounded in scripture and tradition.  For example, Matthew 5:48 says: “You, therefore, must be perfect, _as your heavenly Father is perfect_.” It is also a consequence of God’s pure actuality, for only what has some unactualized potential could fail to be perfect.",problem contradicts first statement effect creation add nothing god god boundless love without creating world creation add something god – completes perfect love entail god need creation order complete perfect unlimited unbounded le heretical claim god creates necessity thus first vatican council teach thathttpswwwewtncomcatholicismlibraryfirst-vatican-council- “ one true living god creator lord heaven earth almighty eternal immeasurable incomprehensible infinite understanding every perfection ” emphasis added course hart would moved pronouncement catholic council doctrine grounded scripture tradition example matthew say “ therefore must perfect heavenly father perfect ” also consequence pure actuality unactualized potential could fail perfect,feser,1140,0
48,"Ian:      I don't think the worries about sharpness of credences apply. For we can suppose that the cases we apply the argument to are precisely ones with sufficiently sharp credences. They might be cases concerning gambling scenarios, or they could be medical cases where the only relevant data one has is statistics from the most recent publications on the subject.      I think all we really need for the argument is that in certain kinds of cases meeting a credence threshold is what makes the difference between not having a belief (or a justified belief) and having a belief (or a justified belief).      By the way, suppose we think that the argument doesn't work for sharpness reasons. Let's say that u is a level of sharpness such that it only makes sense to say that you've met the threshold if you are at r+u or higher and that you haven't met it if you are at r-u or lower, and if you're between r-u and r+u it's indeterminate.

The credences or degrees of belief of real human beings are unlikely to be consistent. In particular, they are unlikely to satisfy the axioms of probability, especially additivity. At the same time, real human beings need a way of making predictions. Mathematical expectation is out, because that requires at least a finitely-additive measure (normally Lebesgue integrals are defined with respect to a countably-additive measure but they can also be defined with respect to a finitely-additive one). So we need some other method for making predictions or generating expectations when the credences do not satisfy the axioms of probability.",ah block term - background interested expected value respect non-probabilities credence degree belief real human being unlikely consistent particular unlikely satisfy axiom probability especially additivity time real human being need way making prediction mathematical expectation requires least finitely-additive measure normally lebesgue integral defined respect countably-additive measure also defined respect finitely-additive one need method making prediction generating expectation credence satisfy axiom probability,pruss,772,1

3756,"I would like to gently point out that space and time do not have inherent existence, but rather are epiphenomena or, more accurately, are literary devices within the framework of scientific discourse. Motion is only a displacement ""in space and time"" as a linguistic construct; motion is simply the change in state of any entity. If an entity does not undergo a change in state, nothing occurs and there is no ""flowing time"" for it. Time is only a numbering of different changes in state, just as space is only the enumeration of the extension of a body.   Therefore, when Aristotle states that a mobile does not move as long as its state changes, he is correct. Without a cause, it does not change state and does not move. His physics states something fundamental with respect to the symmetries observed in physics, the first being that of Galileo's group, which states exactly this and that is that the laws of physics at rest or in constant motion (i.e., when the entity does not change state even if the observer is at rest or in motion with respect to it) are the same; not only that, but this is also consistent with the Lorentz group, and that is, if an entity is constantly accelerated in a gravitational field and, therefore does not change state while always remaining equally accelerated, here too the laws of physics do not change for it. That is, Aristotle's approach is perfectly compatible with both Newtonian and Einsteinian-style physics. And certainly compatible with a physics that would claim that the tearing, understood as the first derivative of acceleration, that it undergoes is always constant.

3667,"When related to quantum mechanics it makes no sense to speak decently of the parts and the whole while doing the economy to really understand what the difference between pure and mixed states is: which, actually, is what leads to the deep understanding of the Bell’s inequalities.   It is also meaningless to talk about Aristotelian forms if we tend to interpret them like “shapes” having measurable extensions and movements: potency is, per definition, not actual and cannot be described in terms of measurements. But potency is real, like QM shows, and the interaction of a quantum system with an instrument can be perfectly described in term of measurements.   To understand that a potency is not localized in any point of space and time till it interacts with an instrument, we can give the ideal example of a bridge long 300’000 km, one quality of the bridge is to be breakable, the measurement of this property will consist in trying to break that bridge, if the measurement is successful that bridge will be broken in whatever point, then we will not have a breakable bridge but a broken bridge, i.e. the actual state of the bridge will bridge will change from breakable into broken and this concern the whole bridge, independently from it length and independently from the time needed for the information to be shared at both ends of the bridge: whatever will be measured at that time is simply the fact that that bridge is broken.   There is a paradigm that twists the mind of too many people, even physicists, when thinking about a physical system: in the Aristotelian world as well as in the Quantum world which just need two assumption to perfectly define a physical system, namely the fact that (a) for each physical state it exists another which is orthogonal to itself and (b) that movement consists in loosing some properties (which become orthogonal) while getting other which were potentially accessible; in the Newtonian/classical physics there is a third assumption which is claimed, but unnecessary in Quantum and Aristotelian physics, which is the fact that one requires (c) that the result of an experience must be either actual or potential.   The fact that there is no need of (c) in the “daily’s everybody’s physics” like the Aristotelian one as well as in the Quantum one, shows that there is unity of being and logic and little solution of continuity between both interpretative bodies.

Rather than (and prior to) ""immoral,"" it would seem to be utterly pointless (inconceivable in relation to causal finality) and incoherent, and as such metaphysically impossible, on the presupposition of a sound (essentialist) metaphysical understanding of good (as fulfillment) and evil (as privation).""      It's a necessary moral fact that I intuitively grasp. One that I am more certain of than a lot of ordinary facts. Asking for my ""warrant"" here would be like asking me how I can be so confident that contingent facts must have an explanation - I could give you arguments, but at the end of the day it is obvious to me and I am convinced I grasp its truth simply by understanding it.      It absolutely *is* a moral fact. The fact that you can explain it through finality and essences doesn't change it so, as I'm sure you know, so I don't know what exactly your point would be.      If you accept that it is impossible for God to do what I just said, then what's the difficulty in making a similar (prima facie) judgment about the evil in our world? I believe there may be good, morally intelligible reasons for God to not interfere with our rotten world, in this sense it is different from the pointless-torture world. But in the absence of those reasons, our world would be as impossible as the torture-world, given God's perfect nature. This is sufficient to get the problem of evil going: the proponent simply thinks that postulating the existence of those morally sufficient reasons is implausible or too much of a cost. It IS a cost, but the theist will presumably want to hold that it is offset by the positive case for God, such that it's a cost the theist is willing to pay.      ""...fine, that's a subjective report, but the post here addresses that problem; if it means ""there's a real problem here for which we have no adequate solution,"" then I think you're mistaken...""      Well, I believe my views of evil reflect objective reality. Again, I know it and I would bet my house on the idea that God, or anything that is metaphysically perfect or subsistent existence, cannot create a pointless- torture world. This is a subjective report on my part but is also what I think about objective reality. And just like I am willing to bet my house on God not being able to create a world of pointless torture, I would also be willing to bet my house that God cannot possibly do-nothing about an innocent person that is suffering horribly in this world (say, being burnt), unless there is a greater good to be gained by his non-interference (or a proportionate evil avoided by his non-interference).      For example, suppose the burning contributes to the victim's ultimate virtue and happiness in an eternal heaven by giving them fortitude or whatever, in a way that somehow outweighs the suffering the victim endured on earth. Some people would find this implausible, but this is just an illustration, so suppose it's the case. Suppose also that this is the only potential good to be gained from that burning. Then if that good did not exist, I insist that God could not permit that victim to be burned. God would have to interfere to prevent or stop the burning. A corollary is that if the burning happens, and someone finds it implausible that the burning contributes to the victim's ultimate virtue and happiness in heaven, then the burden constitutes evidence against God's existence, since God would not allow the burning unless the burning contributed to the victim's virtue and happiness in heaven. So the person has to either conclude God doesn't exist, or be forced to accept something they find implausible (that the burning contributes to the virtue etc.).

3813,"Let us see what say, Oderberg has to say about virtual existence. In pg. 71 of ""Real Essentialism"":      ""Supposing there to be elementary particles (a proposal I deny), and supposing these to be quarks, it does not follow from the fact that every material substance is made of quarks that every substantial form is the form of a bundle of quarks, because in the existing substance the quarks have no substantial identity of their own, their behaviour having been fully yoked to the function and operations of the substance in which they exist. The substantial forms of the particles exist virtually in the substances they constitute. In other words, the quark is ontologically dependent on the whole of which it is a part, but its causal powers persist, albeit in a way radically limited by the whole. The substantial form is what determines the permissible and impermissible behaviour of the quarks in the body, which is why some chemical reactions typically occur, others rarely, and others not at all. Nor is there any particular bundle of quarks of which the form could even be the form, given the familiar fact that every body loses and gains quarks all the time. Again, it is the form that determines the when, how, and how much of the loss and gain may occur, with external circumstances merely operating upon predetermined possibilities.""      From this characterization, what we should expect is that the behavior of a free electron (or whatever elementary particle) is radically different from an electron in an hydrogen atom (in a molecule, in a protein, in a cell, all the way up the levels of substantial organization), which is precisely what happens and any half-decent physicist will confirm. Or simply open a quantum mechanics textbook and see the radically different solutions of the Schroedinger equation for a free particle or a particle in a potential well or in a Coulomb potential, etc.      ""However, Albert the Great and Duns Scotus held a different view: namely, that the human body contains forms at multiple levels, which means that the particles comprising it are still particles.""      This is a related, but different issue (and indeed one hotly debated in medieval times), the unicity of substantial form.

Beyond the focus of Thomistic proofs on God as the cause of the existence of the world, it seems to me that even more can be done with proofs that were not thought possible at the time of Aristotle or St. Thomas. This would require somewhat of a partnership between Thomism and the work of scientists of an ID bent.      Aristotle thought that there was no possible philosophical demonstration that the world was created in time and not eternal. St. Thomas agreed. This pertains to species or kinds in that they imagined the philosophical possibility that the forms of various animal kinds have been generating offspring eternally. Inferences from the fossil record however show that this is not the case. So we have to account for the origins of these various kinds or species.      Now the suggestion that such a question has always been approached in a metaphysically neutral way is naive. We have to have some idea of what a species is before we even approach this question. On this point, the classical and medieval realist account of a species is radically different from the Darwinian account which was influenced by a nominalist metaphysics. The darwinian account looks for minute differences to distinginguish species and so you have various small mouth bass ""species"" in such a view based on some amount of (now) genetic variation.

411,"This morning, however, I noticed that one can also take the idea of discounting small probabilities more literally and still get the exact same results as by trimming utility functions.

True.      _and completely unable to repent_      Not properly put. All people, including Paul, were unable to repent without grace. With grace, all are able to repent. God has made grace available on account of Christ's redemption: to us who came after Christ, by believing in His work and receiving baptism; to those before Christ (like Abraham) by believing in the One to come and in his redemptive power to save, and obeying God.      _Fundamentally, every unregenerate person is habitually in mortal sin and cannot save himself:_      Nobody can save himself. All who, knowing that Christ is God the Redeemer become incarnate, refuse to receive the baptism He commanded by which we are regenerated, are unregenerate and have rejected the channel of grace which Christ ordained. All those who have received sanctifying grace through baptism, may be saved if they remain in that state of grace, or may be saved after falling again into sin by being repentant, and all should pray for the grace of final perseverance. None who are baptized are _excluded_ from that grace but by their own sins.      _G-d invented salvation for the benefit of people who are irrepentant and in habitual mortal sin._      God ""invented"" salvation for all, so that all might receive the gift of salvific grace. In doing so, they receive the possibility of breaking free from habitual sin.      _That is the only category of people salvation is of any use for._      Salvation only applies to the people who are, were, or would have been in sin, but for Christ's redemptive sacrifice. That's...all human beings.      _Any other category of person can be fixed by correction and deterrence, and does not need salvation._      That's Pelagianism, a heresy. Because of Adam's sin, all are (or would be) in sin, but for Christ's salvific act. In addition, even for Adam and Eve _before their sin_ , they were unable to be in the state of supernatural union with God but for the **gift** of grace, which enlightened them above the power of their natural faculties. None can be in the state of the blessed in heaven but for the gift of grace, none can attain it merely by their own unaided efforts, but all can attain it if they receive grace and persist in it.",add general comment particular paul able receive salvation came term habitual state mortal sin envy paul like everyone else able receive salvation without grace u jesus christ salvific sacrifice true completely unable repent properly put people including paul unable repent without grace grace able repent god made grace available account redemption u came christ believing work receiving baptism christ like abraham believing one come redemptive power save obeying god fundamentally every unregenerate person habitually mortal sin save nobody save knowing christ god redeemer become incarnate refuse receive baptism commanded regenerated unregenerate rejected channel grace christ ordained received sanctifying grace baptism may saved remain state grace may saved falling sin repentant pray grace final perseverance none baptized excluded grace sin g-d invented salvation benefit people irrepentant habitual mortal sin god invented salvation might receive gift salvific grace receive possibility breaking free habitual sin category people salvation use salvation applies people would sin redemptive sacrifice sall human being category person fixed correction deterrence need salvation pelagianism heresy sin would sin salvific act addition even adam eve sin unable state supernatural union god gift grace enlightened power natural faculty none state blessed heaven gift grace none attain merely unaided effort attain receive grace persist,feser,2553,0

He does not elaborate, but I’d propose doing so as follows. Faith involves trusting the testimony of divine authority concerning matters that are usually not otherwise knowable to us. Now, sometimes things are not knowable to us because they are in the future, to which we have no access. But sometimes they are not knowable to us because they are past, and the past is also something to which we have no access, or at least no direct access. Hence, Aquinas seems to be saying, it is fitting that faith involves matters of the latter sort as well as the former sort. And the Incarnation’s being a past event (which it could not have been if it occurred at the end of the world) makes it possible for it to be among the things we know by faith in what God has done in the past.

4014," _The assent due to the Pope's teaching differs here, because his teaching is different, not the other way round. Do you seriously argue this principle everywhere (that authorities and their modes of teaching differ primarily because of the assent they induce)?_      I go by what the Church says. The Church teaches that we owe deference to the pope's teaching, including to his non-infallible teaching. She also teaches that we owe deference to the _teaching of the Church_ , including that of the bishops. In both kinds she refers to that kind of deference that falls under the term ""religious assent."" There are, under religious assent, different degrees of deference called for. If the non-infallible teaching of the pope is a different _kind of thing_ than the teaching of the bishops, I have not heard a name for it. If the kind of assent given to the pope's teaching is a different kind of assent than what is given to the teaching of the bishops, I have not heard a name for it. Please do tell.      _John XXII did not teach heresy,_      I did not say it was. As you well know. Not all error is heresy.      _and only (in two sermons) propounded, as opinions,_      I have read that he ""taught"" it, not that he ""proposed it as an opinion"". I would be glad to have his _actual words_ in those two sermons to see the truth, if you have a basis on which to say that he ""proposed it as opinion"". In general terms, I would suggest that a bishop ""teaches"" in sermons except he makes explicit reference to an idea being less certain and offer that it _may_ be not given credit as true. A pope would need to be even more careful than other bishops to successfully ""not teach"" in a sermon.      _each of us is directly subject to the Pope's jurisdiction_      But of course.      _The Pope is no ""president""_      Well, he can in fact preside, but that does not describe his office nor are his powers limited to presiding. Of course.      _Not only is all episcopal jurisdiction a participation in Papal jurisdiction;_      Not only does Pastor Aeternus NOT say this, it implies the opposite:      _5\. This power of the Supreme Pontiff by no means detracts from that ordinary and immediate power of episcopal jurisdiction, by which bishops, who have succeeded to the place of the apostles by appointment of the Holy Spirit, tend and govern individually the particular flocks which have been assigned to them. On the contrary, this power of theirs is asserted, supported and defended by the Supreme and Universal Pastor; for St. Gregory the Great says: ""My honor is the honor of the whole Church. My honor is the steadfast strength of my brethren. Then do I receive true honor, when it is denied to none of those to whom honor is due.""_      Nowhere does this even _hint_ that the powers (and jurisdiction) of each bishop derive from that of the pope, the implication seems (to me) clear that this is NOT the case, and that the bishops' offices and powers are indeed those of the Apostles, ""by the appointment of the Holy Spirit.""",assent due teaching differs teaching different way round seriously argue principle everywhere authority mode teaching differ primarily assent induce go church say church teach owe deference teaching including non-infallible teaching also teach owe deference teaching church including bishop kind refers kind deference fall term religious assent religious assent different degree deference called non-infallible teaching pope different kind thing teaching bishop heard name kind assent given teaching different kind assent given teaching bishop heard name please tell john xxii teach heresy say well know error heresy two sermon propounded opinion read taught proposed opinion would glad actual word two sermon see truth basis say proposed opinion general term would suggest bishop teach sermon except make explicit reference idea le certain offer may given credit true pope would need even careful bishop successfully teach sermon u directly subject jurisdiction course pope president well fact preside describe office power limited presiding course episcopal jurisdiction participation papal jurisdiction pastor aeternus say implies opposite power supreme pontiff mean detracts ordinary immediate power episcopal jurisdiction bishop succeeded place apostle appointment holy spirit tend govern individually particular flock assigned contrary power asserted supported defended supreme universal pastor st gregory great say honor honor whole church honor steadfast strength brother receive true honor denied none honor due nowhere even hint power jurisdiction bishop derive pope implication seems clear case office power indeed apostle appointment holy spirit,feser,3031,0

1558,"@Tony      It should be mentioned that the quote on the understanding to be given to the term 'proselytism' when it appears in Church documents, taken from a 2007 CDF document under Benedict XVI ('Doctrinal Note on some Aspects of Evangelization'), is a footnote (49) from a text whose main body is entirely devoted to the legitimacy of sharing one's faith.      Even in ordinary language, the term 'proselytism' does have a vaguely negative connotation these days, so it is fair enough that the Church has chosen to deploy it to denote negative ways of promoting the faith, while giving this clarifying definition in the 2007 document.      The same magisterial document explains: ‘Everywhere and always, each Catholic has the right and the duty to give the witness and the full proclamation of his faith. With non-Catholic Christians, Catholics must enter into a respectful dialogue of charity and truth, a dialogue which is not only an exchange of ideas, but also of gifts, in order that the fullness of the means of salvation can be offered to one’s partners in dialogue. In this way, they are led to an ever deeper conversion to Christ…The work of ecumenism does not remove the right or take away the responsibility of proclaiming in fullness the Catholic faith to other Christians, who freely wish to receive it.’ (12)      ‘…Love and witnessing to the truth are aimed above all at convincing others through the power of the word of God.

4022,"So, I would offer as a result something that stems from the way an infallible teaching comes out of the ordinary teachings of the college of bishops: before a specific pronouncement that such a teaching **has become** an infallible teaching, the popes, when they repeat such an infallible teaching, should not be referred to as ""teaching infallibly"". When the pope, in his ordinary exercise of his office as bishop and teacher, repeats the same teaching that bishops (and popes) before him taught, he is _doing the same thing_ they were doing: they were ""teaching"" but doing so as the ordinary exercise of the office of teacher - and that ordinary exercise is not ""teaching in an infallible way"" even if the teaching HAD become infallibly taught already. On the other hand, when such a teaching _has been pronounced_ as ""having been taught by the CHURCH infallibly"" through the ordinary exercise of the bishops in a universal agreement achieved by the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and the pope reiterates that same teaching, we shouldn't say the pope is ""teaching infallibly"" because that doctrine's infallibility _has already been made manifest_ , the pope is merely reasserting what has already been manifested. (We would not normally refer to a later pope who simply repeats the doctrine of Pius IX on the Immaculate Conception as the (later) pope _also_ ""teaching that doctrine infallibly"" - the extraordinary kind of action was taken by Pius IX, and later popes don't have to take on an extraordinary act to mere agree with it, that's an entirely ordinary kind of action.)      Finally: a doctrine that is long taught by the teachers of the Church (especially, the bishops) doesn't become infallible merely from it being taught ""for centuries"" or even ""for many centuries"". While time is _one aspect_ of the way we discern such an infallible doctrine, it is not the core criterion. Rather, it is through _agreement_ by the college of bishops throughout the world. This agreement is difficult (or perhaps impossible) to _identify_ without looking at centuries of common agreement, but arguably ""centuries"" is not by itself _sufficient_ evidence of the universality required. Therefore, it is better to speak (as you did in one place) of popes repeating doctrines that are ""independently known to be infallible"" than of popes repeating doctrines taught ""for centuries"" if you want to capture popes in their ordinary exercise of their magisterial office on teachings that are (separately) infallible.",would offer result something stem way infallible teaching come ordinary teaching college bishop specific pronouncement teaching become infallible teaching pope repeat infallible teaching referred teaching infallibly pope ordinary exercise office bishop teacher repeat teaching bishop pope taught thing teaching ordinary exercise office teacher - ordinary exercise teaching infallible way even teaching become infallibly taught already hand teaching pronounced taught church infallibly ordinary exercise bishop universal agreement achieved guidance holy spirit pope reiterates teaching say pope teaching infallibly infallibility already made manifest pope merely reasserting already manifested would normally refer later pope simply repeat doctrine pius ix immaculate conception later pope also teaching doctrine infallibly - extraordinary kind action taken pius ix later pope take extraordinary act mere agree entirely ordinary kind action finally doctrine long taught teacher church especially bishop become infallible merely taught century even many century time one aspect way discern infallible doctrine core criterion rather agreement college bishop throughout world agreement difficult perhaps impossible identify without looking century common agreement arguably century sufficient evidence universality required therefore better speak one place pope repeating doctrine independently known infallible pope repeating doctrine taught century want capture pope ordinary exercise magisterial office teaching separately infallible,feser,2502,0

3998," _it does NOT teach that, and the matter can [be], and is discussed by theologians;_      The fact that the Church is perfectly fine with theologians _discussing_ the matter, i.e. debating it, holding opposing views, with neither side being reprimanded, by that very fact means that      **The Church does not teach** that _the Pope cannot err in non-ex-cathedra teaching_. That is to say, while a Catholic in good standing may think it is true that the pope cannot err in non-ex-cathedra teaching, he cannot represent that his opinion is ""The Church's position"" on it, not at this time. If the Church ever decides to refine this issue so as to take a definite position and ""define"" on it, then of course there will no longer be room for theologians to debate it. But until then, the fact that theologians are free to debate it means that the Church _does not teach_ one definite answer to the question.      To take it a step further: one of the proposed ""solutions"" to ""pope's cannot err on faith and morals"" - in the face of a manifest case of error by John XXII - is that a pope who issues forth such an error, by that very fact, loses his papacy, and the see becomes vacant. (A variant of this opinion reserves this loss to cases where the pope tries to teach heresy, which is of course a narrower subset of error.)

For another thing, Benedict thought the restrictions imposed on the celebration of the Latin Mass by Pope Francis’s _Traditionis Custodes_ were “a mistake” that “jeopardized the attempt at pacification” of traditionalists within the Church.

During my high school years in the early 80s, I had only a vague awareness of the doctrinal controversies roiling the Church. I then knew little more than that they had something to do with liberal theologians and their opposition to Pope John Paul II. My first clear memory of Ratzinger himself is from the very end of that decade, when I had left the Church and was on my way to becoming an atheist. I read a magazine article about him and his work as the pope’s chief doctrinal officer. The impression it left me with was of a man of deep learning and gravitas. For some reason, what stood out especially was a remark of his quoted in the article, to the effect that a sound theology “cannot… act as if the history of thought only seriously began with Kant.” (I later learned that this came from a lecture of his since reprinted as the third chapter of _[God’s Word: Scripture – Tradition – Office](https://www.amazon.com/Gods-Word-Scripture- Tradition- Office/dp/1621643727/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1OBXNMW1E21RU&keywords=ratzinger+god%27s+word&qid=1672518516&sprefix=ratzinger+god%27s+wor%2Caps%2C396&sr=8-1)_.)",im sure first became aware cardinal joseph ratzinger later become pope benedict xvi high school year early vague awareness doctrinal controversy roiling church knew little something liberal theologian opposition pope john paul ii first clear memory ratzinger end decade left church way becoming atheist read magazine article work chief doctrinal officer impression left man deep learning gravitas reason stood especially remark quoted article effect sound theology “ … act history thought seriously began kant ” later learned came lecture since reprinted third chapter god word scripture – tradition – officehttpswwwamazoncomgods-word-scripture- tradition- officedprefsrcridobxnmwerukeywordsratzingergodswordqidsprefixratzingergodsworcapscsr-,feser,1219,0
