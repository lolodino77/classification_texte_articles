3457,"Feser writes: ""Now, I sympathize with Chomsky’s view that the so-called hard problem of consciousness is a pseudo-problem. As I said in my exchange with Goff, I would say that the problem arises only if we follow Galileo and his early modern successors in holding that color, odor, sound, heat, cold, and other “secondary qualities” do not really exist in matter in the way common sense supposes them to, but instead exist only in the mind (as the qualia of conscious experience) and are projected by us onto external reality. If you take this position, you are stuck with a conception of matter that makes it impossible to regard consciousness as material. The solution, I would say, is simply not to go along with this assumption in the first place, but to return to the Aristotelian-Scholastic view the early moderns reacted against, and which is compatible with the commonsense view of matter. The so-called hard problem of consciousness then dissolves.""      But per Chalmers: ""The “hard problem” is explaining why any of the neural processes in question are associated with conscious awareness, given that it seems at least prima facie possible that they could do what neuroscience describes them as doing in the complete absence of consciousness.""

I do believe in God. Perhaps, believe is not a good word for what I have in mind - but something more certain than that i.e I know that GOD IS!

2802,"I'd like to discuss the Scholastic distinction between potency and act. It is often alleged that without this distinction, it is impossible to make sense of change. I'm not so sure about that.      Surely we can account for change simply by positing different levels of actuality. Thus an actual piece of gold (a substance) may acquire the higher- level (accidental) actualizations of roundness and flatness, when hammered by a goldsmith. There's no need for talk of mysterious potencies here - just different levels of actuality.      Consider also the fact that every potency, whether passive or active, is grounded in some actuality. A boxer, for instance, has the passive power to be bruised because his body is actually covered with flesh, and he has the active power to hit and knock out his opponent because his body actually contains bone and muscle, enabling him to punch hard.      Readers might ask, ""What's the difference between the account you're proposing and the Aristotelian account? And couldn't simply we define 'potency' as a lower level of actuality?"" The practical difference between the two accounts is that if every potency is grounded in some actuality, then the existence of prime matter, or pure passive potency, becomes a metaphysical impossibility.

665,"Of course Christian doctrine does not lead us to expect little or no suffering, but that is a strong argument against Christian doctrine .   The problem of evil (or suffering) does not say that there should not be so much evil or suffering if _Christian doctrine_ is true, it says that the existence of (so much) evil or suffering is incompatible with a tri-omni God and _hence_ Christian doctrine, along with other doctrines about God, is false. IOW Christian doctrine _cannot_ be true.   It is hardly a secret that ""the Fall"" is one giant theodicy right from the start. But it's a bad theodicy for several reasons, the most important one being that a tri-omni God would not allow for any fall. Without the Fall human beings would have experienced the beatific vision without the need of suffering.      Moreover, this article does not explain why the good are punished and neither does Augustine, it actually comes down to ""nobody is good"" or ""the good are not really punished."".   People who ""shrink from doing their duty to condemn the wickedness that surrounds them"" are not good, so they do not present a case af good people being punished.      And if ""the loss of worldly blessings – material goods, reputation, friendships, health, livelihood, even life itself – is permitted by God so that we might learn not to cling to these things at the expense of the beatific vision, the value of which trumps all else"", that may explain why good people suffer but it isn't a punishment.

1328,"@WCB      Wow. An argument against God's existence that no one has ever thought of before. That is truly remarkable. Surely others have recognized your immense brilliance. You must have a dozen publishers pounding at your doors waiting for you to produce this devastating critique of theism. How do you decide between all the offers you must have? Are you overwhelmed by all the publicity from your singular brilliance? Is that the reason that you don't reveal your real name? Perhaps because we would all be overcome by your rock star status as a philosopher and theologian?      Let's see what widely renowned thinkers do I know that have the initials WCB? Ah, that's right. No one. That is the reason that you are not taken seriously here (anywhere?). That is the reason that Ya'kov referred to you as a ""notorious troll."" From my limited interaction with you, that description fits the bill quite neatly.      However, there is more that can be said and Tom Cohoe has said this well, ""Ever seeing and never perceiving."" That fits the bill quite well also.      But there is no doubt some spark within you that does not want to be an obnoxious troll who is under sad delusions of grandeur. Why not try to follow that spark? Why not stop pretending that you are clever when those around you are not fooled?      Regarding St. Augustine's argument, it addresses the point that God would know the state of the world at creation. After all God knows the state of the world past, present, and future, so despite your inept assertions otherwise, this point has not eluded theologians preceding nominalism or Luther or certainly not you. So why don't you stop pretending? It isn't fooling anyone.      The suggestion that St. Augustine abandoned his account of free will later in his career is a sad trope in older reformed Protestant theology. Your repetition of this sad trope shows that you are most certainly not familiar with the secondary literature on these issues. The account of the will found in his early Cassiacum Dialogues (On the Freedom of the Will) is maintained in his anti-Pelagian writings (e.g. On Grace and Free Will). It is also maintained in his City of God. Han Luen Kantzer Komline has traced St. Augustine on the will in Augustine on the Will: A Theological Account. This work makes clear that St. Augustine did not abandon and account on the Freedom of the Will. It really only takes a cursory reading of a few of St. Augustine's early and late works to realize this. In light of this, it is clear that you are familiar with neither St. Augustine nor the secondary literature on St. Augustine. So, again, who do you think you are fooling? Why keep pretending?      I would continue to expose the nonsense in your post, but I am left to wonder whether it would do any good in encouraging you to stop being a shameless pretender. Perhaps as a sign of goodwill, you might recognize that you have no clue what you are talking about with respect to St. Augustine. Then we can move on to other things that you have no clue about.

That's why I was very (and still am in some way) very afraid to believe or take something for granted. I don't want to believe in something because of how it tastes (i.e good or desirable), but because that's the truth. That's why I (wrongly as I can see now) take the road of ""naturalism"". Not only because of the overwhelming appeal that has today but because it was ""science"" and ""science is the truth"" and ""science is the only thing you can trust that is rational"" because ""it is founded on empirical data"" [I can go on ad nauseam but I will stop here].

I know it sounds ridiculous to compare that crap doctrine of espiritismo with the A-T Meta (and I AM NOT DOING SO). What I am trying to say is that I am very afraid of *having faith* in something that it turns out to be false. I know I must sound like an idiot but I am opening my heart by saying that.

1383,"part 2   As far as I’m concerned, this is all mystical, pseudo-philosophical gibberish. None of these ‘explanations’ mean anything. What is an “eternal act,” or knowledge that doesn’t produce a “metaphysical change” in the knower, or something willed “from everlasting”? Yes, your idea of God is immune to most atheistic attacks, but in securing this victory, you basically hollow out the definition so much that not only is there no trace left of a loving Father we can have a personal relationship with (not such a serious problem for religions like Buddhism, but a massive blow for traditional Christianity), but ‘God,’ identified as nothing more than a string of abstract concepts, is (like all abstractions) absolutely bereft of any concrete reality independent of a thinking subject.   Third leading from my second issue is are you a Pantheist David? I have read both yours and Ed Fesers blog sites and I recall you saying “The accusation of pantheism troubles me not in the least… There are many ways in which I would proudly wear the title… I am quite happy to be accused of pantheism.”   So, unless you were being facetious, I don't see how that doesn't confirm his and his followers' beliefs about you. You've also said that ""Pantheism is a vague term."" Well, the simplest definition is God=World that's it, he is immutable, indifferent, formless and eternal. However, is it possible that the accusations of pantheism are actually misunderstood as Panentheism?   Put simply, a Panentheist (also known as also known as Monistic Monotheism), is the belief, similar to Pantheism, that the physical universe is joined to God, but stressing that God is greater than (rather than equivalent to) the universe. Thus, the one God is synonymous with the material universe and interpenetrates every part of nature (as in Pantheism), but timelessly extends beyond as well. This conception of God influenced New England Transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, and was popularized by Charles Hartshorne (1897 – 2000) in his development of process theology in the 20th Century. The Neoplatonism (which you declare yourself a follower of) of Plotinus (in which the world itself is a God) is to some extent panentheistic with polytheistic tendencies, and philosophical treatises have been written on it in the context of Hinduism for millennia (notably in the “Bhagavad Gita” and the “Shri Rudram”). For more details on Panentheism I have provided a video link below, feel free to watch it.

595,"Talmid      I do not necessarily reject the idea that being and goodness are the same, but if that's so, being should be good and not be bad in any way. It doesn't suffice that every being has ""some"" good, no, being ""is"" good.   Hence, there cannot be anything bad. And that's the crux of the problem and that's why the Classical Theism isn't consistent.   To say that even bad things should exist is simply logically impossible ""if"" being is good. That's a straightforward contradiction.      Sure, if an infinite multiverse exists, then somewhere, Quark the Ferengi exists. That may not be an insane idea, but it is not the standard Christian view, which is that God could have chosen not to create anything at all.   Your claim about qualitative and quantitative maximization is interesting here, because it contradicts what you claimed before, namely that ""being is intrinsically good"". if being is intrinsically good, then not being is intrinsically bad, so Quark the Ferengi not existing would be intrinsically bad.

2289,"Walter,      I don't think I understand your response. I did not mean to suggest that God could not have stopped the Fall (if ""the Fall"" happened; I was just using that as an example) with sheer power, but rather that a world like ours in which the Fall happened might be better than a world in which the Fall never happened. Or that, from the point of view of perfect rationality, one should not have attempted to prevent the Fall. It seems to me that there are many possible reasons, even beyond our ken, for why God could not have prevented the Fall without some immorality, or perhaps without sacrificing a greater good that could morally justify his inaction.      I do not deny that there is a plausibility to thinking that, prima facie, if God existed, the world should look a lot better than it is. Speaking for myself, I think it raises the probability of atheism to some degree, but I find it very hard to go beyond a prima facie impression here. It seems the problem of evil would require us to adopt a ""God's eye"" point of view that I don't think people can reliably have (I certainly can't have it, at the moment). I am not even sure enough about everything in morality. There are moral dillemas that I am unsure about, for example.

But I do not know enough to confidently say that there can be no reason for it all.

3295,"@ Laudator Temporis Acti,      ""It does in math""      Even in math, truth never corresponds with popularity because math depends on the logic under which it is developed and even humans can develop a logic under which what is true in one system is false under another. Under what authority do you ban the rule of inference ""(A is true implies that A is false)""? If every mathematician in the world called such a rule lunacy, that would not be sufficient to ban it. Lunacy is not even a mathematical concept.      This proffered rule of inference is perhaps the logic of some rock. Since everything is false under its logic, it wills nothing, hence does nothing of its own will. Conventionally we say a rock does not have a will.      :-)      A lunatic has a logic somewhat damaged (by convention) but still closer to normal. He can will himself (usually) to put food into his mouth and even raid the fridge, and even if his neurons are so destroyed that he can't do that, his body will digest the food under its own degraded logic. Of course he could be dying, but that is to be undergoing a change of state to something that is no longer human (lacking a will).      Mathematics just is not objective, somehow outside of creation. It is what God wants it to be. Furthermore, God is beyond our understanding.

800,"Walter,      Libertarian freedom entails that you can, at the same time, have non- determining reasons for doing X and non-determining reasons for not-doing-X. What is the intention, beyond the choosing of one over the other? It is when you intend (and hence have chosen) to do one instead of the other, and thus are ready intending the action. If the intention is not the choice, then it would be the motivation. And in both cases there is no difference between our case of LFW and God's:      Before I finally make my choice, I have motivations for X and ~X. In w1 I go on to choose X; in w2 I go on to choose ~X. And yet there is no difference in my intrinsic properties between w1 and w2.      This is what is weird in LFW, but as explained, it is the same for God as well as for us. So this is no objection against divine simplicity per se.      But perhaps you think that the ""intention"" is neither the choosing nor the motivation, but an accompanying mental state that is always present when, and only when, a choice is made. In that case, the intention would NOT be a necessary condition for a choice being made. Because if it were, we would never be able to choose anything, since we would have to choose our intention before being able to make a choice, and that is circular or regressive. I can, under motivations for both X and ~X, and with no intention whatsoever (since I haven't made the choice yet), choose to do X or ~X and thus effectively, freely bring about X or ~X without this ""intention"" entity/property. So God's having or not having an intention in this case would be irrelevant for his power to choose, but it ALSO is the same for us.      But if the the problem is that God must be different when he chooses X as opposed to ~X, then again this would not work under libertarian freedom for us as either. Because (again) when you choose between X (in w1) or ~X (in w2), the cause of your choice has exactly the same intrinsic properties between worlds. The cause of your choosing X in w1 is you at t in state S; and the cause of your choosing ~X in w2 is you at t in state S. There is a branching, and yet there is no difference in intrinsic properties of you at t between worlds.

I have carefully examined a lot of classical theologians on this point.Augustine, Boethius, Ansalm, William of Okham, Duns Scotus, Aquinas, Molina and others. And some of the enormous modern secondary literature.      Augustine assert that though God foresees all he does not cause all. Boethius claims that as a man sees something, that man does not cause what he sees. Thus God sees future events but likewise does not cause them. And on and on it goes. Everybody is indeed wrong      The particular argument I posted is not answered by the nearly 1600 years of theologians trying to explain the issue of God's foreknowledge and free will. Not until Luther's ""Bondage Of The Will"" did the issue of this become a problem.      Late in his life after the Pelagian affair Augustine gave up on free will, which was followed by Calvin, Luther et all.      I am sure that somewhere somebody else has made the argument I have, but I have yet to see anybody that has among the theologian community.      The key concep I wrote about is if Go d decides to create a Universe, God must choose an initial states of creation. And that we are told by centuries of theologians God foresees the future. Based on biblical claims God does that.   Now all I do is follow these claims to their logical conclusion. No classical theologians had the wit to notice this problem.

Indeed, social media exchanges and political discourse sometimes seem to consist in little more than rash judgment as Aquinas characterizes it – that is, judgment about “the inward intention, or other uncertain things” about another person, which “proceeds not from benevolence but from bitterness of heart.” Opponents are routinely demonized, condemned as wicked rather than merely wrong. Their claims and arguments are not evaluated by way of a dispassionate consideration of evidence and logical strength, but dismissed _a priori_ as stemming from bad motives. Policy differences are attributed, not to sincere but mistaken opinions about what is best for the country, but to cynical political calculation.

1862,"The bishop's office of ""teacher"" is not exercised ONLY when he _expressly_ ""intends to bind the faithful"" in an _unreserved_ way, for a bishop _cannot_ bind the faithful in that way because he is not infallible. But he still exercises the office of teacher when he teaches in such a way that he expects his people to hear _and receive and be guided by_ his teaching. This is what the magisterial office _means_. The pope, in exercising his _ordinary_ office of bishop of Rome, exercises the same magisterial authority as any bishop does. But by being the pope, his teaching acts also teach the whole world. It is impossible for him to teach ""just Rome"" and not implicitly teach to the world.      Just as is true of ALL the bishops, who teach their teachings in various **degrees** of definitude by which they intend others to receive them, so also does the pope. When he indicates, by details such as formality of venue, tone of voice, and declarative mood, that a teaching is more definitive than usual, we are obliged to give it a greater degree of respect, (i.e. to assent to it with less _reserve_ than usual). As a result of these truths, it will be automatically the case that when the pope wishes to be _especially_ definitive, he will typically be doing so especially _to the world_. But even THERE, he has degrees available: if the pope gives a speech to an international forum of obstetricians and speaks there about the immorality of certain tubal ligations (as contraceptive), it is inevitable that he be speaking broadly to the whole world, in that those doctors are from the whole world and will repeat his teaching around the world. But the venue is not as _formal_ as an encyclical, and so has a lesser degree of definitude - lesser sense that he ""intends to bind"" - as to that aspect. The intention he has is CAPABLE OF DEGREE. Hence the deference we give it must be capable of degree.      Once we realize that religious assent - the kind of assent that is not the ""unreserved"" assent given to infallible teachings - is **reserved** assent, we must realize that it comes in many flavors just as do the reservations by which it is not **UN** reserved. And the _intention to bind_ is also present in many degrees.",office teacher exercised expressly intends bind faithful unreserved way bishop bind faithful way infallible still exercise office teacher teach way expects people hear receive guided teaching magisterial office mean pope exercising ordinary office bishop rome exercise magisterial authority bishop pope teaching act also teach whole world impossible teach rome implicitly teach world true bishop teach teaching various degree definitude intend others receive also pope indicates detail formality venue tone voice declarative mood teaching definitive usual obliged give greater degree respect ie assent le reserve usual result truth automatically case pope wish especially definitive typically especially world even degree available pope give speech international forum obstetrician speaks immorality certain tubal ligation contraceptive inevitable speaking broadly whole world doctor whole world repeat teaching around world venue formal encyclical lesser degree definitude - lesser sense intends bind - aspect intention capable degree hence deference give must capable degree realize religious assent - kind assent unreserved assent given infallible teaching - reserved assent must realize come many flavor reservation un reserved intention bind also present many degree,feser,2230,0

1248,"Hi Mister Geocon and Oktavian,      Belief in the Curse of Ham has a long Catholic pedigree. Most of the following quotations are taken from Adiele's book.      Several Church Fathers (e.g. St. Basil of Caesarea, St. John Chrysostom, St. Ambrose, St. Augustine of Hippo) all taught that the human institution of slavery had its origin in Ham's sinfulness. They did not link this to Africa. However, St. Jerome disturbingly refers to ""Ethiopians"" (Kushites) as ""black and cloaked in the filth of sin,"" adding: ""At one time we were Ethiopians in our vices and sins. How so? Because our sins had blackened us.""      Surprisingly, the first text to explicitly link the curse of Ham to Black Africans was the Babylonian Talmud, completed around 600 AD.      In the tenth century, Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria (877-940) was the first Christian Church leader to identify Black Africans as being among those afflicted by the Curse of Ham:      “Cursed be Ham, and may he be servant of his brothers...He himself and his descendants, who are the Egyptians, the Negroes, the Ethiopians, and it is said the   Barbari.”      According to the famous Christian geographical work ""Cursor Mundi"" (1300 A.D.), Noah's son Shem and his descendants were freemen who dwelt in Asia. Japhet and his descendants were nobles and knights who came to live in Europe, while ""Ham, the accursed"" and his descendants were slaves who were sent to Africa.      In the 15th century, the famous Portuguese chronicler Gomes Eannes de Azurara (1410-1474) appealed to the writings of a 12th century archbishop of Toledo, Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada (1170-1247) to support his contention that Black Africans were doomed to servitude because they were the accursed descendants of Ham:      ""The servitude of non-Muslim Moors (West Africans) resulted from the curse, which,   after the Deluge, Noah laid upon his son Ham, cursing him in this way: 'that his race   should be subject to all the other races of the world. And from his race these Blacks are descended,' as wrote the Archbishop Don Roderick of Toledo and Josephus in his Book on the Antiquities of the Jews, and Walter, with other authors who have spoken of the generations of Noah from the time of his going out of the Ark.""      In the 15th century, Dominican Friar Johannes Annius of Viterbo (1432-1502) wrote that the curse of Ham forced him into exile in Africa: “As a result of his sin, Ham is exiled to Africa.”      In the 18th century, French biblical scholar and Benedictine abbot Augustine Calmet (1672-1757) wrote in a work titled “Dictionary of the Holy Bible” (1722): “Noah assigned to Ham the nations of Africa. The occasion of the color of his sons was that Noah being one day asleep discovered his nakedness, and Ham passed that way without covering him; on which accounts his descendants are born with black complexion, and the gift of the prophecy was taken from them.”      In the 19th century, John England, the first Catholic bishop of Charleston, USA, wrote in a letter to US Secretary of State John Forsyth (1780-1841) that the enslavement of Black Africans was entirely lawful, because of the sin committed by their ancestor, Ham:      “Since every Catholic must accept Adam's fall as an essential ingredient in the human condition, he should likewise believe that it certainly was not then against the divine law for Shem and Japheth to use the services of the Black race, since their progenitor had been cursed by God for his sinful conduct.”      Finally, Pope Pius IX issued a Prayer for the Conversion of Africa through the Office of the Sacred Congregation of Rites on October 2, 1873, in which he declared: ""“Let us pray for the most wretched Ethiopians in Central Africa, that Almighty God may at length remove the curse of Cham from their hearts, and grant them the blessing to be found only in Jesus Christ, our God and Lord."" This prayer came with a 300-day indulgence.      Is it ""kind of bonkers"" to say that the Curse of Ham was a major influence on Catholic thought? I think not.",hi mister geocon oktavian belief curse ham long catholic pedigree following quotation taken book several church father eg st basil caesarea st john chrysostom st ambrose st augustine hippo taught human institution slavery origin sinfulness link africa however st jerome disturbingly refers ethiopian kushites black cloaked filth sin adding one time ethiopian vice sin sin blackened u surprisingly first text explicitly link curse ham black african babylonian talmud completed around ad tenth century patriarch eutychius alexandria - first christian church leader identify black african among afflicted curse ham “ cursed ham may servant brothershe descendant egyptian negro ethiopian said barbari ” according famous christian geographical work cursor mundi ad son shem descendant freeman dwelt asia japhet descendant noble knight came live europe ham accursed descendant slave sent africa th century famous portuguese chronicler gomes eannes de azurara - appealed writing th century archbishop toledo rodrigo jiménez de rada - support contention black african doomed servitude accursed descendant ham servitude non-muslim moor west african resulted curse deluge noah laid upon son ham cursing way race subject race world race black descended wrote archbishop roderick toledo josephus book antiquity jew walter author spoken generation noah time going ark th century dominican friar johannes annius viterbo - wrote curse ham forced exile africa “ result sin ham exiled africa ” th century french biblical scholar benedictine abbot augustine calmet - wrote work titled “ dictionary holy bible ” “ noah assigned ham nation africa occasion color son noah one day asleep discovered nakedness ham passed way without covering account descendant born black complexion gift prophecy taken ” th century john england first catholic bishop charleston usa wrote letter u secretary state john forsyth - enslavement black african entirely lawful sin committed ancestor ham “ since every catholic must accept fall essential ingredient human condition likewise believe certainly divine law shem japheth use service black race since progenitor cursed god sinful conduct ” finally pope pius ix issued prayer conversion africa office sacred congregation rite october declared “ let u pray wretched ethiopian central africa almighty god may length remove curse cham heart grant blessing found jesus christ god lord prayer came -day indulgence kind bonkers say curse ham major influence catholic thought think,feser,4040,0

2057,"@ Anonymous:       _Hand waving away consciousness by saying it is caused by evolution is the cause of it, you haven't done anything to address the substance of the philosophical arguments about why consciousness is so weird._      Naturalists say that when brains reach a certain level of ""complexity"", they become conscious (something ""emerges""). And what does that mean? That's just the process of **eduction of the substantial form from the potentialities of prime matter,** described by Aquinas 700+ years ago.      That means that the forms (ADN) are in the potency of prime matter (chemicals) and are then drawn out into act through the agency of the efficient cause (the powers existing in the environment). Once you reach the ""threshold of complexity"", the form appears and so do the new properties and powers, like being self-conscious and being capable of abstract thinking.      So naturalists have reached the same conclusion that St. Thomas did. But St. Thomas had a coherent, hyper-extense, detailed up to the point of exhaustion metaphysical system. They claim ""emergence"" but they can not offer an explanation for it, that's why they hide under the cover of ""Natural Selection"" and her wondrous powers.

803,"""Being infinitely good, would it not go against His nature to choose a lesser good, as against a better one? Similarly, would it not go against His nature to to choose not to create, if He knows that the choice to create is better?""      I am also puzzled by this. But since I am not bound by dogma, I am open to accepting that God creates out of a necessity of his perfect nature. But it'd be nice if it can be avoided.      So there's a lot to be said about this, and what I'll mention doesn't come close to covering the whole topic, but I think it's an interesting thought, and maybe an escape route. Consider: one could deny that perfect goodness MUST entail always doing the best, if the best is supererogatory. The very notion of a supererogatory action is that it's a good action you can perform without being anything like an obligation. We can imagine you can, for instance, donate 100 dollars to a charity right now, and it would be good and virtuous of you, but it wouldn't be an obligation. You can fail to do it without thereby incurring in sin or evil.      I think creation might be a supererogatory good like that. If it's supererogatory, then God would be very willing to create (or create the best) without nevertheless *having* to create. So you could say God is somehow likely to perform supererogatory actions, but not determined (thus preserving contingency).      I don't think this works for the problem of evil or anything like that (I very much believe God must, for example, prevent or stop a torture if there is no greater good to be gained from permitting it), but I think it's a nice enough candidate to solve the necessitarian issue",infinitely good would go nature choose lesser good better one similarly would go nature choose create know choice create better also puzzled since bound dogma open accepting god creates necessity perfect nature nice avoided lot said mention come close covering whole topic think interesting thought maybe escape route consider one could deny perfect goodness must entail always best best supererogatory notion supererogatory action good action perform without anything like obligation imagine instance donate dollar charity right would good virtuous obligation fail without thereby incurring sin evil think creation might supererogatory good like supererogatory god would willing create create best without nevertheless create could say god somehow likely perform supererogatory action determined thus preserving contingency think work problem evil anything like much believe god must example prevent stop torture greater good gained permitting think nice enough candidate solve necessitarian issue,feser,1663,0

3210," _1) Yes it was an act of the Magisterium, even from the Pope himself, thus 2) Therefore the Magisterium is not protected even from heresy in its ordinary teachings._      What, specifically, makes you phrase the second as ""not protected from _heresy_?""      We know that the Church's fallible teachings (I.e. those which were not taught infallibly) are ""not **absolutely** protected"" from ERROR, in that fallible teachings are reformable and might eventually be reformed because they were wrong and needed to be corrected.      But one cannot conclude from this that the Church's fallible teachings are therefore _utterly_ not protected from error, i.e. that there is simply NOTHING that limits how much error they have. That doesn't follow. As I understand it, the Church says of these teachings that they, too, are influenced by the Holy Spirit, in a lesser way, such that the Church will not fall into such error (on non-infallible teachings) that she _lastingly_ leads Christians into grave error that endangers their souls. These criteria are inherently difficult to apply to particular cases, but the basic _idea_ is that, like situation where the Holy Spirit's action by which He molds the teachings of the many bishops so that they (without formal collusion) all teach the same thing so that it becomes an infallible teaching, so also at other times He molds their teaching so that where one or some are in error, others are not, or at least not gravely and for long. This is indeed a protection, afforded to _the Church_ , that does not protect from every error, rather from an error having a certain scale of effect.      Clearly the Arian heresy running rampant was an error _in the ranks of bishops_ so that they were teaching error, but it never swallowed the entire episcopate. Since it is simply the case that the bishops who were Arians were teaching _wrongly_ by their _officially demanding_ belief in Arianism, and since the bishops certainly exercise their magisterial office when they teach in an official capacity in such wise as to insist on and require assent, we know that ""the Magisterium can teach error"" _in at least that limited sense_ , don't we?",yes act magisterium even pope thus therefore magisterium protected even heresy ordinary teaching specifically make phrase second protected heresy know fallible teaching ie taught infallibly absolutely protected error fallible teaching reformable might eventually reformed wrong needed corrected one conclude fallible teaching therefore utterly protected error ie simply nothing limit much error follow understand church say teaching influenced holy spirit lesser way church fall error non-infallible teaching lastingly lead christian grave error endangers soul criterion inherently difficult apply particular case basic idea like situation holy action mold teaching many bishop without formal collusion teach thing becomes infallible teaching also time mold teaching one error others least gravely long indeed protection afforded church protect every error rather error certain scale effect clearly arian heresy running rampant error rank bishop teaching error never swallowed entire episcopate since simply case bishop arians teaching wrongly officially demanding belief arianism since bishop certainly exercise magisterial office teach official capacity wise insist require assent know magisterium teach error least limited sense,feser,2176,0

944,"@jmchugh:      ""There is no way that you could argue that the actual existence of Satan is a positive good.""      I would argue that the existence of Satan, qua *being* is a positive good, because being is good -- this is Thomism 101. God did not create Satan as Satan; Asking why permit or allow Satan qua Satan, is asking the wrong question. Satan does not exist alone in a vacuum but as an element within the created order. The created order is good (not even Satan wants to destroy it to the point of non-existence which is what you are arguing entails, rather he wants to pervert it to his *own* perverted ends); could there be some created order that is better in some aspect or other, say, without Satan as Satan? Maybe; and? At any rate, we have no way of ascertaining such things.      ""Now, as to us mortals you set-up a false dichotomy.

903,"""It may matter for LFW where that Will came from, but it doesn't matter for my argument.""      How does it not matter for your argument, if whether or not the model counts as LFW depends on it? Of course if there is such a thing as this ""Will"" which determinately lead to vanilla rather than chocolate, we must be the ones to cause such a Will. Otherwise, again, we are in no control whatsoever of our actions - a Will just emerges (uncaused by us, hence beyond our choice or control) which then causes our actions. Of course it matters for your argument, since if your model is unacceptable for libertarian freedom proponents then it won't work as a defense against my claim (that LFW for humans already involves the issue of an agent being able to cause 2 distinct effects without a change in intrinsic properties).      ""What matters is that there is a Will to do X. And a will to do X is not thé same as a Will to do not X.""      And the problem - to repeat myself again - is that if we are to maintain libertarian freedom, we have to have caused this Will. Otherwise the Will- for-X just emerges beyond our control and determines that we do X, and this is no libertarian freedom.      But if we cause the Will-to-X we cannot require a further, second order Will- to-will-to-X, otherwise we end up in a regress. That's been my point for a while now. So it turns out that this ""Will"" isn't really required for our choices. It's a confused notion that would lead to an infinite, vicious regress.      The existence of a Will-to-X becomes superfluous, since even on the assumption that it exists we must be able to choose and cause it (or the Will-to-not-X) without requiring a further second order Will. So it turns out this ""Will"" is not really required for free actions. In the end, LFW requires that an agent be able to choose and cause X or ~X without a difference in intrinsic properties. If there is a Will-to-X, it does not determine X, and is not incompatible with the possession of a Will-to-not-X.",may matter lfw came matter argument matter argument whether model count lfw depends course thing determinately lead vanilla rather chocolate must one cause otherwise control whatsoever action - emerges uncaused u hence beyond choice control cause action course matter argument since model unacceptable libertarian freedom proponent work defense claim lfw human already involves issue agent able cause distinct effect without change intrinsic property matter x x thé x problem - repeat - maintain libertarian freedom caused otherwise will- for-x emerges beyond control determines x libertarian freedom cause will-to-x require second order will- to-will-to-x otherwise end regress point turn really required choice confused notion would lead infinite vicious regress existence will-to-x becomes superfluous since even assumption exists must able choose cause will-to-not-x without requiring second order turn really required free action end lfw requires agent able choose cause x x without difference intrinsic property will-to-x determine x incompatible possession will-to-not-x,feser,2009,0

R are motivating reasons for a choice.      By saying that ""if an agent did something because of reasons, that is another way of saying that he was determined by those reasons"" you are begging the question against LFW.

387,"None of that suggests that there is anything wrong with Zhao and the others in a narrow formal sense – given their conditions, their formal results hold. Of course, the philosophical implications and practical relevance are a different matter. The same applies to your examples.         Against Zhao and the others, one could say this: it’s great that, given their conditions, choosing to accept every time ‘eventually’ becomes favoured, but is ‘eventually’ likely to be in your lifetime? It depends on the specifics.      Against your examples, one could say that they require you and the other party to have unlimited money and unlimited time to gamble with it. What matters is the likely conditions when time or money run out.      I’m doubtful about the applicability of standard decision theory for one-0ff high stakes choices, but I’m not sure that any of these cases are decisive.      Our intuitions about sequences of fair (favourable, unfavourable) bets are reflected in the martingale (super-martingale, sub-martingale) optional stopping theorems. But these theorems have conditions which can be violated in quite ordinary setups. A simple example: repeated triple-or-nothing on fair coin flips. Each bet has positive expectation, but if you accept them all, you will lose you initial stake with probability 1.      You don’t need exponential growth to get this sort of thing. A simple example is textbook Gambler’s Ruin. A fair coin is flipped. You win $1 on Heads, lose $1 on Tails. You play repeatedly against the house until either you go broke, or the house does. You start with $M, the house with $N. Your chance of ruin is M/(M+N), of ruining the house is N/(M+N). Your expected final fortune is of course the $M you started with.

408,"What we ought to conclude, I think, is that exemplar theories are bananas. :-)      On a more serious note, one thing that I think a proponent of exemplar theories could say in response is that a mere fictional story would not be sufficiently inspirational. For example, consider the story of the Little Engine That Could. This might inspire someone to persevere during a difficult trial in life to some degree. But it likely wouldn't be a life-changing sort of story. Such a person reading the story might say, ""Yes, that is all well and good and is somewhat encouraging, but it isn't as if there was actually a Little Engine that came to belief in itself and accomplished a seemingly impossible task."" Or, perhaps a better example, consider the first Avengers movie in which Tony Stark against all odds destroyed the Chitauri mothership, nearly losing his life in the process. This might be somewhat inspirational, for instance, to a soldier who finds himself going up against similarly dismal odds. Nevertheless, it is likely that the soldier will also be somewhat dismissive of the story as a source of inspiration because, after all, Tony Stark is a fictional character who has his fictional Iron Man suit, something that the soldier obviously does not have. What would be far more inspirational to the soldier is a true story about the D-Day invasion and the bravery of the soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy against dismal odds. If this line of thought is right, then it seems that the exemplar theorist could insist that the degree of inspiration necessary for salvation simply could not come about unless the exemplar is real and not fictional. This would rule out the monkey example. And, it could be further argued, the exemplar (or the cause thereof) would have to be divine as only the divine could create a true story that is sufficiently inspirational for salvation. Thus, we avoid Pelagianism. How an exemplar theorist would proceed to spell all of this out, I have no idea. But it is a line of argument they could take. I think a major issue, however, that the exemplar theorist will inevitably run into is explaining why it couldn't simply be the case that a fictional story could be sufficiently inspirational for salvation so long as people *believed* it was true, which is of course all that the monkey example involves. Perhaps it could be argued that the story of the Gospel qua story could not have been produced but by divine intervention and/or inspiration?

2197,"@ Infinite_Growth,      ""speaking of free will, it disturbs me greatly that traditional Catholic theology has not considered animal abuse to be a deadly sin like Lust or Gluttony. That goes very contrary to religions like Judaism or Buddhism.""      First, note of pre-Christian Judaism that it certainly permitted the use of animals   for human needs, including for rites of sacrifice. Christianity does not include the use of animals for sacrifice so from your point of view that is an improvement.      Second, note that Jesus said:      ""Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."" (Matthew 5:17-20 KJV)      But much of what is specifically listed as law in pre-Christian Judaism is subsumed in Christianity as Love rather than being specifically listed, so while abuse of animals is not listed, it is an act of hatred against what God loves, which includes all of Creation. Now we have been given all of material Creation for our proper and needful use, but an act of hatred against anything is a turning from God and is a mortal or deadly sin as Christians always understood.      So at no time did Christianity embrace the evil treatment of animals. It would have always been recognized as hate. But as in many other things, a formal doctrine against the mistreatment of animals was later worked out from these foundational principles of Christianity. It certainly is explicit now. See, for example, the Catechism as promulgated by Pope John Paul II.      Buddhism is not a development of Christianity or Judaism. Therefore, its rites and rules, while based on partial truth, are not held wholly correct. We cannot properly be directed by Bhuddhist doctrine.

For a while I held that God couldn't know the future because the future is not, and the act of knowing necessarily requires that which is, but fortunately some friends talked me out of that one. To my understanding, the answer (insofar as we can get to it) involves distinguishing between absolute necessity (i.e. it follows from the nature of the thing) and conditional necessity (which is brought about by a specific set of circumstances) and having a proper understanding of God's eternal knowledge (not foreknowledge) as a presentialist view, wherein God sees all things which are (for us) past, present, and future all as the present and immediately available. This knowledge of what presently is does not necessarily preclude the rational agent from choosing to do otherwise in that moment other than what he or she was already doing, i.e. it is conditionally necessary and not absolutely necessary.

2122,"The ""God Hypothesis"" is just another Ultimate Why question, which Paul Edwards addressed many years ago in a Intro to Phil textbook      ""Regarding our second issue, cosmic why questions, Edwards begins by considering what he calls “the theological why.” The theological answer to the theological why posits that a god answers the question of meaning. Major difficulties here include how we could say anything intelligible about such disembodied minds, as well as all of the other difficulties involved with justifying such beliefs. Edwards focuses particularly on whether the theological answer really answers the question, mentioning a number of philosophers in this regard: “Schopenhauer referred to all such attempts to reach a final resting place in the series of causes as treating the causal principle like a ‘hired cab’ which one dismisses when one has reached one’s destination. Bertrand Russell objects that such writers work with an obscure and objectionable notion of explanation: to explain something, we are not at all required to introduce a “self-sufficient” entity, whatever that may be…Nagel insists that it is perfectly legitimate to inquire into the reasons for the existence of the alleged absolute Being…”[ii] Thus, the theological answer appears to be one of convenience that does not fully answer our query; rather, it stops the inquiry by asking no more why questions.      Edwards differentiates the theological why question—are there gods and do they provide the ultimate explanation?—from what he calls the “super-ultimate why.” A person posing this latter question regards the theological answer as not going far enough because it does not answer questions such as “Why are there gods at all?” or “Why is there anything at all?” or “Why does everything that is, exist?” The theological answer simply puts an end to why questions arbitrarily; it stops short of pushing the question to its ultimate end. One might respond that it is obsessive to continually ask why questions, but most reflective persons do ask “Why does anything or everything exist?” suggesting that the question is basic to thoughtful persons. Of course, it may be that we just don’t know the answer to this ultimate mystery—all we can say is that the existence of anything is a mystery, its ultimate explanation remaining always beyond us.      According to Edwards, while some philosophers take the ultimate why question seriously many others argue that it is meaningless. The reason for this is that if a question cannot in principle be answered, as so many philosophers claim about this super ultimate why question, then that question is meaningless. Critics of this view agree that the question is radically different from all others but disagree that it is meaningless. They respond that ordinarily, questions must in principle be capable of being answered to be meaningful, but not in the case of this ultimate question. Yet if a question really cannot be answered, and if all possible answers have been ruled out a priori, is that not the very definition of a meaningless question?      Another way of arriving at the conclusion that the question “why does everything exist?” is meaningless, is to consider how when we ordinarily ask “why x?” we assume the answer is something other than x. But in the case of “why anything at all?” it is not possible to find something outside of everything to explain everything. So meaningful why questions are those which are about anything in the set of all things, but if our why question is about something other than everything, then why has lost its meaning because it is logically impossible to have an answer.""

2214,"Walter      ""Of course there is a difference in my intrinsic properties between w1 and w2. Otherwise there is no reason why I choose X over ~X.   The cause of my choosing X in w1 is me with my intention to choose X, which is an intrinsic property.   You are describing a random process instead of a choice.""      No, Walter, there is no intrinsic difference if LFW is true, and this is precisely how there can be a libertarian free choice. Otherwise the presence of you + the intention would determine the resulting action and we would no longer have libertarian freedom. If the cause were you and the intention, then in order to preserve libertarian freedom you would have to cause your intention. But then to cause your intention you would end up in an infinite regress, unless you accept that you at t in state S can cause Intention (what it does in w1) or not cause it (what it does in w2). In other words: there is no difference in intrinsic properties in the agent in worlds 1 and 2, and yet the agent can cause X or ~X. See? That's my point.      There is literally no difference between humans and God when it comes to this weird aspect of libertarian freedom. For determinism to be avoided, it must be the case that someone at t in state S can cause both X or ~X. For our libertarian choice of X, there is a time t which is the earliest time with the property that after t it is no longer causally possible for us to choose ~X instead. How else do you think libertarian freedom could work, without determinism? If the choice follows a difference in intrinsic properties, then the choice would be determined by such a difference and thus would no longer be libertarian, lest we cause the difference in properties (the intention, say), but then the same problem would reappear.      You say that this is ""random"". That is a common accusation by those who *reject* libertarian freedom. I do not accept that it is random; I believe libertarian choice is a sui generis category that is neither random nor deterministic, but that is beside the point. My response was that the ""problem"" Vincent was pointing out doesn't just affect Divine Simplicity, but also libertarian freedom for humans. It is THE SAME THING for us. The issue there doesn't lie with classical theism, but LFW; LFW by itself requires that an agent can be able to (non-randomly) bring about different effects without there being any change in the intrinsic properties of the agent when it is choosing.      So if you have a problem with God choosing to cause different things without requiring any difference in intrinsic properties as a condition for that, you should also have a problem with libertarian freedom for humans. Which you probably do (you probably do not accept LFW). Vincent however does presumably accept LFW, so he has to choose between rejecting LFW altogether or dropping that objection.      The only difference between us and God in this case is you could argue that our intrinsic properties change *after* we have CHOSEN (not when we are choosING). But so what? It is not even clear to me that we must change intrinsically after we have chosen; why insist that this must happen universally, even with God? It would still be the case that for a libertarian free choice to be made, the cause need not incur in change, since the cause can indeed, under the same exact intrinsic properties, bring about different effects.

845,"As a Catholic who accepts classical theism and divine simplicity, this topic of freedom vs. necessity of creation is one that I struggle with.      God's decision to create or not to create does not end with that binary choice; rather the choice to create involves the further choice of WHAT to create, out of an infinite number of possibilities.      Good, being omniscient, would know what all these possible creations are, and also know which ones are better, which less good, and which one is best of all.      Being infinitely good, would it not go against His nature to choose a lesser good, as against a better one? Similarly, would it not go against His nature to to choose not to create, if He knows that the choice to create is better?      Does this all come down more to definitions than substance? Perhaps the meaning of ""freedom"" in the context of the Divinity is something that our human minds can't quite grasp? Do freedom, necessity, and goodness in some sense ""merge"" together into the simple infinity of God?      Any help understanding these things better will be much appreciated.

2827,"@ the emperor with no clothes      Okay, Walter, now that we have established that the emperor is walking around in the buff, let's try to put some clothes back on him.      You wrote:      ""theism cannot explain the rules of logic either and cannot take them as seperate entities because there are no entities that are truly seperate from God.""      As I pointed out above, theism is not pantheism, so you need to work on that distinction between credible, reliable witnesses and non-credible witnesses in order to have better discernment about who to listen to about what is or is not ""Theism"". Now that we have cleared this up, we can address the final false statement in your response (You squeezed in quite a few in that little post).      You claimed that theism has no means of accounting for the rules of logic. Well, you got that one wrong as well. Theism is the *only* means of accounting for the rules of logic. Let's recap on where we have gotten so far. It is clear, for reasons noted above, that the laws of logic exist. Anyone making an argument presupposes this. It is also clear, for reasons noted above, that the laws of logic are not material. Walter does not have them buried in his basement (In fact if they were anywhere, it is clear from the foregoing that they are not at Walter's house).      So, we have laws that exist and are immaterial. Along with this, these laws do not change from place to place or over time. They are eternal. They are not contingent on change in the material world. Yet these laws, just like numbers, have real implications in the material world.      The principle of non-contradiction is not *merely* a principle of thought. It also permeates material being. It is for this reason that no one has ever seen a non-chair-chair or a square circle or a married bachelor. They are impossible to conceptualize and they are impossible to be (or exist).      So, if these principles effect being and yet seem also to be mind dependent, how else do we account for them except by an eternal mind? Now Mr. Walter, if you have read your Edward Feser, you should be having flashbacks at this point because Dr. Feser makes precisely this argument with regard to numbers and other abstract objects in Five Proofs. He aptly refers to it as the Augustinian argument. Now we have cleared up the last of your string of misunderstandings. In the future, perhaps you might pause and reflect on whether or not it is cogent to try to convince us that your keyboard does not exist by means of typing on it.      Now, Mr. Don Jindra. I hope to address your proposal sometime soon.

1813,"In support of your point, can we say that one essential factor differentiating magisterial and non-magisterial acts is the manifested will of a bishop to bind to obedience the faithful under his authority to adhere (at least in some degree) to a particular teaching?      Vatican II said of the Ordinary Magisterium, 'In matters of faith and morals, the bishops speak in the name of Christ and the faithful are to accept their teaching and adhere to it with a religious assent. This religious submission of mind and will must be shown in a special way to the authentic magisterium of the Roman Pontiff, even when he is not speaking ex cathedra; that is, it must be shown in such a way that his supreme magisterium is acknowledged with reverence, the judgments made by him are sincerely adhered to, according to his manifest mind and will. His mind and will in the matter may be known either from the character of the documents, from his frequent repetition of the same doctrine, or from his manner of speaking.' (Lumen Gentium 25)      As with Vatican I's dogma of papal infallibility, I would think that this is intended by Vatican II as a description to be also applied retrospectively, even if in the 7th century they were not yet thinking about it in these explicit terms.      The 'manifest mind' of a pope refers especially to the doctrinal content of a document; his 'manifest will' refers especially to his intention to teach and bind the faithful of the world. Normally he will not express this intention in so many words, but it can be known 'either from the character of the documents, from his frequent repetition of the same doctrine, or from his manner of speaking.'      But as a minimum, the intention to somehow bind the faithful of the world would require the intention to promulgate the teaching to the faithful of the world (not just sending a letter to one individual, leaving it to his choice and initiative to promulgate to the world as he saw fit).      The Holy See these days generally publishes a papal teaching document (including letters to individuals or groups) in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis if the pope's intention had been to promulgate that document to all the faithful - thus confirming that it has at least some level of magisterial authority.      Was it the intention of Pope Honorius that his letters to Patriarch Sergius be promulgated to the Catholic world as binding (albeit non-definitive) teaching? It does not appear so, and the condemnations of Honorius by the Ecumenical Councils do not require us to think this either.      Just as his letters do not fall within Vatican I's description of the papal Extraordinary Magisterium, neither, apparently, do they fall within Vatican II's description of the papal Ordinary Magisterium. And therefore, neither do they provide a precedent showing that a teaching of the papal Ordinary Magisterium can be not merely in error, but heretical.",support point say one essential factor differentiating magisterial non-magisterial act manifested bishop bind obedience faithful authority adhere least degree particular teaching vatican ii said ordinary magisterium matter faith moral bishop speak name christ faithful accept teaching adhere religious assent religious submission mind must shown special way authentic magisterium roman pontiff even speaking ex cathedra must shown way supreme magisterium acknowledged reverence judgment made sincerely adhered according manifest mind mind matter may known either character document frequent repetition doctrine manner speaking lumen gentium vatican dogma papal infallibility would think intended vatican ii description also applied retrospectively even th century yet thinking explicit term manifest pope refers especially doctrinal content document manifest refers especially intention teach bind faithful world normally express intention many word known either character document frequent repetition doctrine manner speaking minimum intention somehow bind faithful world would require intention promulgate teaching faithful world sending letter one individual leaving choice initiative promulgate world saw fit holy see day generally publishes papal teaching document including letter individual group acta apostolicae sedis intention promulgate document faithful - thus confirming least level magisterial authority intention pope honorius letter patriarch sergius promulgated catholic world binding albeit non-definitive teaching appear condemnation honorius ecumenical council require u think either letter fall within vatican description papal extraordinary magisterium neither apparently fall within vatican description papal ordinary magisterium therefore neither provide precedent showing teaching papal ordinary magisterium merely error heretical,feser,2927,0

This is why I describe it as a necessary part of our complete creation, and not as a good in itself. Of course us normal Catholics don’t envy the suffering in others.

(Quote)   ""The error which I am here trying to correct is one of the most sincere and respectable errors in the world; I have sympathy enough with it to feel shocked at the language I have been driven to use in stating the opposite view, which I believe to be the true one. To say that God ‘is a particular Thing’ does seem to obliterate the immeasurable difference not only between what He is and what all other things are but between the very mode of His existence and theirs. I must at once restore the balance by insisting that derivative things, from atoms to archangels, hardly attain to existence at all in comparison with their Creator. Their principle of existence is not in themselves. You can distinguish what they are from the fact that they are. The definition of them can be understood and a clear idea of them formed without even knowing whether they are. Existence is an ‘opaque’ addition to the idea of them. But with God it is not so: if we fully understood what God is we should see that there is no question whether He is. It would always have been impossible that He should not exist. He is the opaque centre of all existences, the thing that simply and entirely is, the fountain of facthood"".   (End quote)         The last quote is from Lewis's commentary on the nature psalms in the O.T.   All of the Scripture references in the beginning of the quote are from the Psalms.      (Reflections on the Psalms, Chapter 8 ""Nature"")   (Quote)   ""But of course the (Jewish) doctrine of Creation leaves Nature full of manifestations which show the presence of God, and created energies which serve Him. The light is His garment, the thing we partially see Him through (104:2), the thunder can be His voice (29:3–5). He dwells in the dark thundercloud (18:11), the eruption of a volcano comes in answer to His touch (104:32). The world is full of his emissaries and executors. He makes winds His messengers and flames His servants (104:4), rides upon cherubim (18:10), commands the army of angels.   All this is of course in one way very close to Paganism. Thor and Zeus also spoke in the thunder; Hermes or Iris was the messenger of the gods. But the difference, though subtle, is momentous, between hearing in the thunder the voice of God or the voice of a god. As we have seen, even in the creation- myths, gods have beginnings. Most of them have fathers and mothers; often we know their birthplaces. There is no question of self-existence or the timeless. Being is imposed upon them, as upon us, by preceding causes. They are, like us, creatures or products; though they are luckier than we in being stronger, more beautiful, and exempt from death. They are, like us, actors in the cosmic drama, not its authors. Plato fully understood this. His God creates the gods and preserves them from death by His own power; they have no inherent immortality. In other words, the difference between believing in God and in many gods is not one of arithmetic. As someone has said ‘gods’ is not really the plural of God; God has no plural. Thus, when you hear in the thunder the voice of a god, you are stopping short, for the voice of a god is not really a voice from beyond the world, from the uncreated. By taking the god’s voice away—or envisaging the god as an angel, a servant of that Other—you go further. The thunder becomes not less divine but more.

In its place we have a highly abstract mathematical description of nature that tells us very little about its intrinsic nature. But at the same time, the Cartesian idea of the mind as the repository of qualities that cannot be given a mechanical or mathematical analysis remains.

True, he did not think reason could penetrate into the natures of things as they are in themselves.

However, in Kant’s view this entailed no doubts about the rational foundations of morality or of science (which concerns the world as it appears to us rather than as it is in itself).

(Davies’ views on this issue were the subject of [another post from years ago](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2010/05/davies-on-divine-simplicity-and- freedom.html).) Critics of divine simplicity often argue that it is incompatible with God’s having freely created the universe. For if God could have done other than what he has in fact done, doesn’t that entail that God is changeable, contrary to divine simplicity? And if he is in fact unchangeable or immutable, doesn’t that entail that he could not have done otherwise, and thus created of necessity rather than freely? In response, Davies points out, first, that creating _freely_ simply does not in fact entail _changing_. Certainly it simply begs the question to assume otherwise. For the classical theist, God creates _eternally_ or atemporally, and what is eternal or atemporal does not undergo change. Still, he could have done otherwise than create, so that this eternal act of creation is free.",several new page also added previous discussion divine freedom chapter divine simplicity davy view issue subject another post year agohttpsedwardfeserblogspotcomdavies-on-divine-simplicity-and- freedomhtml critic divine simplicity often argue incompatible freely created universe god could done fact done entail god changeable contrary divine simplicity fact unchangeable immutable entail could done otherwise thus created necessity rather freely response davy point first creating freely simply fact entail changing certainly simply begs question assume otherwise classical theist god creates eternally atemporally eternal atemporal undergo change still could done otherwise create eternal act creation free,feser,1084,0

1602,"@anonymous.      What does or does not ""seem heretical"" to you is not the criteria by which something is or is not heretical. The position you are describing is a position that has been condemned by the Church. Pope Pius IX condemened the following proposition in the the Syllabus of Errors: ""Good hope at least is to be entertained of the eternal salvation of all those who are not at all in the true Church of Christ"" (17). This condemnation draws from a previous encyclical entitled Quanto Conficiamur.      So the suggestion that there is good reason to hope for the salvation of all men has been condemned by the Church. Balthasar was aware of this and would not have gone so far as to say that we have good reason to hope for the salvation of everyone. To make this assertion is again to affirm what the Church has condemned.      Where does this leave the position of Balthasar? It leaves him with a hope that is based neither in reason nor in revelation. It leaves him with an irrational hope. That is the problem with the position: it is rooted neither in reason nor revelation.      In the Tradition, the overwhelming weight of the Church Fathers is against the positions of Gregory of Nyssa and Origen and a couple of clever theologians do not overturn the weight of a broad range of Church Fathers that includes a great number of doctors of the Church.      It certainly doesn't overturn the words of Christ that ""the way is narrow and *few will find it*"" (Mt. 7:14). These words are not taken seriously by those in the Balthasar camp. Balthasar's position on this issue was influenced by the reformed theologian Karl Barth. Such theologians have an account of election that has little place for human freedom and secondary causality. They read salvation as though God will save us without us. This is not the Catholic position. The Catholic position is that we need to cooperate with God's grace to be saved.      So, the Balthasarian position in order to remain orthodox on this point would have to posit that we should hope that everyone in history has, is, and will cooperate with God's grace. Well, we might ask the disciples of Balthasar, what reason do we have for thinking that everyone in the world has, is, and will cooperate with God's grace? Oh, you don't have a good reason to think that? Well why in the world would I hold a position that has no rational basis and is widely rejected by the Church Fathers? Why would I hold a position that is so manifestly contrary to the state of our corrupt society?

An infinite random sequence such as I have described is just a limited model of simplicity that is also, in some sense, about something that is not known or accessible, or understood by someone. Applied to my free will, it would not mean that my free will choices are not ordered to anything. It means, assuming its validity, that whatever process I use to arrive at a decision is beyond your ability to know, understand, or predict, using whatever measurement or calculation you care to try.      I don't use logic to argue for the existence of God, at least not logic alone. I use observation. I open my eyes and see what God has made as in Romans 1:20. The logic part starts with an assumption: ""There must be a simple unifying cause of all of creation"". What we know as ""science"" cannot fill the role of logic in the argument. Science is not remotely simple, but is highly complex. The simpler explanation, we call God. It is, in fact, a definition.      ""If, given a finite amount of time, I will arrive at a point when death ends the process, then it is simply a matter of random chance.""      No, my free will choice is random to you, not to me. You cannot understand how I choose or predict what I will choose, but that does not make my choice disordered. It just means that you cannot understand or predict it. You do not just ""happen"" to be a theist or an atheist when you die. Your intellectual part, private as described (the reason for modelling it as random), directs your free will (it can still deliberately choose wrongly), but such a deliberate wrong choice turns you from God, where you will stay if you die in refusal. Your knowledge of the love of God plays a role in the choice, but you freely make it.      ""it seems that God has waited just long enough for the first time Adam did something wrong to condemn him""      God did not condemn Adam or anyone else.      ""since he was the one who put the sequence there in the first place, He knew exactly what was going to happen and when it was going to happen""      The sequence is just a model of unpredictable simplicity.

2265,"God can have all the necessary reasons to create in every possible world. And he knows these reasons by knowing himself.      If your problem is that you think these reasons have to be literal, existing separate things in the divine mind (and they cannot be identified with each other) then the problem isn't with divine creative freedom per se, but rather with the status of the multiplicity of divine ideas (""and 2 must be different from 5!""). That is a different problem. Speaking for myself it's not clear to me that divine ideas must literally exist as separate entities; the nature of knowledge and how (it seems to me) it's basically a ""transparent"" power whereby something is grasped by the knower and understood through itself seems to me compatible with God knowing different abstract facts by means of a single known concrete substance which is analyzed (a substance that happens to be the ground of all possibilia anyway, God), though I cannot hope to imagine it. I think what Dolezal has written on the divine ideas would also be very helpful here.      Thus God's personhood is grounded in impersonal notions like ""being"" and ""act"": for Thomists, these are what God is, primarily""      This misses the point. The point at that stage is precisely that ""being"" and ""act"" are NOT impersonal. Intelligence is an irreducible aspect of existence which some beings (like us) enjoy when they're not limited enough. God's personhood is not grounded in anything impersonal (that would be absurd); existence in its fullness is taken to be irreducibly personal. It's impersonal beings that just happen to be limited enough that they are unable to possess that dimension of being, so to speak. As the ultimate source of personhood and the unlimited actuality of the principle that is the basis of personhood, God is personal through and through.

Did you not read all of what I wrote above? Christ says, ""few will find it"" (the narrow road that leads to heaven). So would you have us believe that those making no effort to find and follow the narrow path, will ultimately land themselves precisely on that path without the slightest effort?

Your reading would require that this should be interpreted: ""You don't really need to make any effort at all because everyone will (or might) get into heave without being on the path or without trying.""

And it's not going to be the super-rich paying either.      If the concern is to provide education as cheaply and freely as possible, maybe we should consider price caps on tuition. The fact is, with the modern internet, we are capable of providing a massive amount of education for dirt cheap compared to what traditional, outdated institutions currently offer. In fact, we already do so: see Coursera, or all kinds of other online options.

If it’s not inevitable, it’s at least the case in Gods perfect plan for creation.      I do however also think that the fall was necessary at some point. We are each created unique. Some of us are like the prodigal son, and some more like his brother. There are lessons the Father wants both types to learn as part of the process of our creation that is this life. Without the ‘fall’ of the prodigal son, there is no opportunity for either brother to make the right choice to align with the father. Just as the creation of our bodies was via a process of ongoing refinement through suffering, our reconciliation with God is a partaking in the redemptive suffering of God as son of man.

True, he does try to undermine traditional metaphysical views about substance, causation, the self, moral value, etc. But he also emphasizes that the hold such notions have over common sense cannot be shaken by philosophical skepticism, since they are too deeply rooted in human psychology.

2816,"(Continuation)      So not just it's unfair and wrong to say that ""this usage is common to Aristotle"" but one thing that I noticed in the book of both authors is the somewhat intentional sidestep or ""shell game"" of problems - like they were trying intentionally guide the book in a way to evade potential questions to their points. To be fair, Siderits tried to address some points of that (I do recommend the reading of the Chapter 4 since the most relevant discussion of points that could be related to our philosophy concentrates there). But his position simply gives me the impression that he tries to misplace the substance into its parts (like a shell game) and then comes to the conclusion that the substance could not exist. In responding to how accidents are always found in the substances (he does not use the term accidents, I'm using it to simplify) if they do not exist, he says:      ""Consider the water atom as an allegedly indivisible substance in which inhere the qualities of color, shape, wetness and mass. Resistance to the notion that these qualities may be thought of as its parts comes from the intuition that qualities do not simply float freely in the air, that they must be tethered to something that then explains their occurrence together with other qualities. Bundle theorists are typically asked to provide the principle of qualitative unity that would explain the co- occurrence of many qualities in the absence of a substance in which they inhere. The Buddhist bundle theorist says this is the wrong question to be asking. Instead we should ask why, in the absence of empirical evidence for the existence of substances as distinct from their properties, we nonetheless have the intuition that substances are required to explain qualitative unity."" (pp. 59)      To say that ""in the absence of empirical evidence"" is just to beg the question. but he goes on to say:      ""By hypothesis, color, shape, wetness, and mass tropes are compresent at a certain spatio- temporal location. This much both sides can agree on. Here is a possible explanation of the fact that we commonly take these to all be properties of a single thing, the water atom. When we wish to specify the location of this mass trope, it is easier to indicate it by using the term “water atom” than by indicating each of the three other tropes present at that location. This makes the communication process more efficient. It also relieves us of the burden of ascertaining just which other tropes are present at that location, given that we know from past experience that mass tropes are generally accompanied by other tropes in a certain range. “Water atom” functions as a convenient designator for a certain bundle of tropes (TS 832– 34; TSP ad TS 581– 83). That they make up a bundle has as much to do with us and our interests and cognitive limitations as it does with how things are in the   world. The world as it is anyway contributes the fact of their compresence. The rest— their being unified by their joint inherence in a substance— is our doing. The Buddhist doctrine of the two truths is their answer to the bundle theorist’s problem of unification.""      Basically, he uses their conventionalist position to ""explain"" how we construe substances from things that are nothing but tropes.

2254,"@Talmid      The same way classical theism and contingent knowledge go together. My open theism is based on the openness of the future (I agree with Pruss and many others that foreknowledge of free acts requires eternalism, but I am a presentist, so I reject foreknowledge of free acts). In other words: there is no difference at all in our views of God - I also believe that he must know every true fact. The difference between us is that I do not believe there are any true facts of what we will choose. Only what we choose or have chosen. So there is nothing for God to know there.      How can God ""learn"" what we choose without undergoing intrinsic change? The same way God can learn any contingent facts without undergoing intrinsic change. Classical theists believe God's knowledge of contingents is externalist and involves only Cambridge changes for him. You already have to believe that God's knowledge differs between worlds without that entailing any change in his intrinsic properties. Even with foreknowledge you have to believe that God only knows what you will do IFF God contingently creates you (unless you are a Molinist - which thomists reject - or you believe God creates of necessity). So you're on the same boat as me when it comes to having to account for God's contingent knowledge without real change. The only difference, again, is that I think there is nothing to know re: ""future choices"".      So no, open theism does not entail God being temporal. I wholeheartedly agree that God is outside of time. But unlike what some (very confused) thomists think, that does not mean that God can ""see the future"" as if there were anything to see there (unless, again, you are an eternalist/B theorist).",talmid way classical theism contingent knowledge go together open theism based openness future agree pruss many others foreknowledge free act requires eternalism presentist reject foreknowledge free act word difference view god - also believe must know every true fact difference u believe true fact choose choose chosen nothing god know god learn choose without undergoing intrinsic change way god learn contingent fact without undergoing intrinsic change classical theist believe knowledge contingent externalist involves cambridge change already believe knowledge differs world without entailing change intrinsic property even foreknowledge believe god know iff god contingently creates unless molinist - thomists reject - believe god creates necessity boat come account contingent knowledge without real change difference think nothing know future choice open theism entail god temporal wholeheartedly agree god outside time unlike confused thomists think mean god see future anything see unless eternalistb theorist,feser,1722,0
664,"@Walter and anon. I’m deliberately using necessary in a way that will not be popular here. I think a huge amount of time and credibility is wasted on arguing whether God had choice in something. Pretty much all of those arguments are meaningless. There are some realities God could have brought forth that we can sort of imagine, say that there are two temporal dimensions and four spatial dimensions. Really tricky to actually get your head around, but we have at least some ability to do so. There are others where we just incapable of even imagining. To argue about God’s choices is therefore meaningless unless he revealed something about it.      When I use necessary here, I mean it purely in that it seems necessary in order to achieve God’s plan, which is at least in part to create children who choose to be as like Him, and can therefore participate with Him in the Trinity. That is an astounding thing, a top down view of the telos of the universe.      Arguing what is necessary from a bottom up perspective in the way that philosophers tend to, in terms of what God could and could not do, is like ants on a cathedral wall arguing about the cathedral’s architecture and construction. Yes they are builders themselves and so know something of building, but it’s several orders of magnitude higher in it’s nature than ants are capable of conceiving.

Under the cover of ""upstanding"" right wing politics, various authors are promoting occultism, while spouting edifying Christian vocab left right and centre.      Here's one example. Michael Warren Davis has done the rounds about Catholic places, having been published quite a bit - in First Things, Crisis Magazine, the Catholic Herald. He is out and about elsewhere too - in The Imaginative Conservative, where he declares he can only slightly disagree (on an issue of art and beauty) with the late Roger Scruton. He recommends Scruton's work ""On Hunting"" as ""an account of tradition from the living heart of that tradition"". The living heart of Idealism, more likely! This is the work that defines God as ""the subjectivity of the world""!      This is not what concerned me the most (I've mentioned it here before, but almost nobody seemed to think it of much interest - no doubt they were too busy reading the ST to notice).      Davis has authored a couple of articles at The American Conservative that are extremely dangerous to politicised Catholic conservatives. One of them ""When Witchcraft was Right-Wing"", depicts the witch Gerard Gardner and his followers as typically right wing. Davis doesn't defend devilry, but the article is bizarrely non-committal on this issue. Davis only gets a little emotional when pointing out how modern leftist witches are not true successors of Gardner!      His most recent article in TAC (""War Against the Modern World) definitely joined the dots. It is a shameless defence of ""Traditionalism"", well-known for occultism and virulent anti-Christianity in all its forms.. The only criticism he allows is that Evola is not so nice because Mussolini and Dugin like him, so Evola - bad. But Guenon - good! And looney tunes King Charles loves Guenon, so he's great too. Steve Bannon is somewhere between Guenon and Evola, so Davis says he ain't perfect.      These ""Traditionalists"" are now producing such volumes of material that those with doubts - real Thomists included, must feel it is useless to respond. It shouldn't be so difficult. After all, the dressing up of esoteric ideas with religious imagery is not new. Though Jonathan Pageau's defence of the Kabbala, and the occult, if only as a ""concept"" or aspect of ""Christianity"" was really going a bit far, even for one of ""them"".      The minds of well-meaning readers, including Catholics, need to be warned about Davis and authors like him.

1066,"Hi Ed,      You write:      As Augustine says, there isn’t “any evil [that] happens to the faithful and godly which cannot be turned to profit,” so that, with St. Paul, “we know that all things work together for good to them that love God” (Romans 8:28).      I have to say that Augustine's remark sounds very Pollyanna-ish. There are some evils which can only be described as soul-breaking, rather than soul- making. Three which come to mind are rape, mutilation and torture. These are horrendous sufferings which serve no ""greater good,"" and which can destroy even a good individual's faith, as the following account of the 17th century ""torture in the pit"" illustrates:      https://sspx.org/en/news-events/news/real-life-silences-character      There were priests, many of them good men, who apostasized. What good was served?      You also cite Augustine to support the following claim: ""We cannot achieve happiness in the world to come if we become too attached to the world that is, and suffering is a means of preventing the latter.""      This might explain some of the suffering that befalls adults, but it fails to explain the death and suffering of a child, who has no worldly attachments.      Finally, original sin (or the fall of Adam) is said to be the ultimate explanation for why humans are permitted to suffer and die, rather than enjoying immortality and bliss. I am not persuaded that a dumb choice by a distant ancestor makes it fair for us to be allowed to suffer soul-breaking evils of the sort described above, but let that pass. What original sin cannot explain is the fact that people (e.g. political prisoners, psychiatric patients) have been beaten or tortured to death, while screaming for Divine deliverance or at least some Divine consolation (i.e. a sense of ""I am with you"") at the moment of death, and in many cases, it never arrives: they die in agony and desolation.

986,"Walter      This awe and fear of being in God’s presence is not something he inspires, it’s His infinite greatness perceived by a finite creature. It’s the shock of reality unveiled. From behind the veil, at times He spills over such that we can experience a diluted form of His presence where words like gentle, tender, love, peace etc are used. For now we only see dimly, our perception is naturally tuned to dim reality, and so it’s in this diluted form that most of us can distinguish anything other than infinite ‘brightness’.      In general you take a position that conflicts with everything revealed in scripture. So where do you get your information on what God is, what God could do and couldn’t do?

2074,"Hey, Tom!      Thanks for answering me!      ""Even if you want to suggest that evolution is a good explanation for why we have such a feature, that itself is a pretty bad explanation for the feature itself.""      I don't want to suggest that evolution is a good explanation for the phenomena, I just asked what can we say in response to that - on a philosophical level. Because these guys I quoted use some energy trying to explain features, functions, etc. based on evolution and I wish to know how to prove on philosophical grounds why appealing to that is wrong.      In what follows, I will try to give some background.      ""In other words, how do you know that natural selection is blind, other than by assuming it, in which case there is nothing that you can say? But there is a lot of randomness in the environment in which natural selection operates.""      I'm not advocating that it's blind or not. I was quoting Ed - if I get him right anyway - on his answer to Ben Shapiro in this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FvYwpyFbIQ). You can see the specific question that Ben is formulating at 39:57 and Ed's response in the following minutes (but I would suggest that you watch the whole video).      Now, back to Ed's response - again, if I get him correctly - he's not arguing against Natural Selection blindness, he's saying Natural Selection could not explain why the human mind is directed at truth (it is really important to note that he's talking about TRUTH directness, not just any other feature in the present case) and I agree with him (because just like he said, natural selection explains fitness and passing genes). And it's important to note too the fact that he was presupposing that it was true when he formulated the argument - not because he may agree with it or not - but because its trueness or not had nothing to do to the point that he was making (again, he said that natural selection explains fitness, etc. and that's not related with the mind directedness for truth per see).      So, now that I made this background to avoid any misunderstandings what I'm trying to ask is: could we make a similar answer disentangling body unity and evolution or natural selection claims?      I do not have any problem with evolution at all. I was just trying to say that someone could conflate two problems (evolution on one side and unity and substantial form on the other).      For example: if someone says that our unity is caused by ""an evolutionary process that co-opted our cells to do what they do now'' someone, plausibly, may think that our unity is just an accidental one.      Personally, I don't think that's true - I think that's insane - but some people believe this. But I can't just say that that's insane - that would beg the question. Instead, I would have to argue philosophically to show that. And that's what I'm trying to say: these two problems i.e the unity substance's (or we can think of its organs functions related to each other as one indivisible unity) and natural selection or evolution could have nothing to do with it each other - but they might seem at least to be related and someone might argue something like the example I presented. That's why I'm asking Ed if we could (or how to) disentangle the two (like in the same way when he was explaining why truth per se has nothing to do with natural selection).",hey tom thanks answering even want suggest evolution good explanation feature pretty bad explanation feature want suggest evolution good explanation phenomenon asked say response - philosophical level guy quoted use energy trying explain feature function etc based evolution wish know prove philosophical ground appealing wrong follows try give background word know natural selection blind assuming case nothing say lot randomness environment natural selection operates advocating blind quoting ed - get right anyway - answer ben shapiro video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfvywpyfbiq see specific question ben formulating response following minute would suggest watch whole video back response - get correctly - arguing natural selection blindness saying natural selection could explain human mind directed truth really important note talking truth directness feature present case agree like said natural selection explains fitness passing gene important note fact presupposing true formulated argument - may agree - trueness nothing point making said natural selection explains fitness etc related mind directedness truth per see made background avoid misunderstanding trying ask could make similar answer disentangling body unity evolution natural selection claim problem evolution trying say someone could conflate two problem evolution one side unity substantial form example someone say unity caused evolutionary process co-opted cell someone plausibly may think unity accidental one personally think true - think insane - people believe say insane - would beg question instead would argue philosophically show trying say two problem ie unity think organ function related one indivisible unity natural selection evolution could nothing - might seem least related someone might argue something like example presented asking ed could disentangle two like way explaining truth per se nothing natural selection,feser,3372,0

609,"@ Walter Van den Acker,      The little logic puzzles that you are setting are tricks that you are playing on yourself.      ""If logic is contingent, so is God, because the proposition 'God exists' is, in that case, a contingent truth.""      Contingent logic and contingent truth are not the same thing. Logic is a procedure that, properly used, takes us from one truth to another. Contingent truth is not absolute truth. ""It takes an hour to swim across the lake"", depends on the lake, the person swimming, and other contingent factors. God knows all the contingencies. They are in the infinite sequence which is contingent to us, but not to God, who is absolute truth. Furthermore, the infinite sequence is an _image_ of God, a Divine Idea, meaning that God knows it. But an image of God is not God any more than the pixels in your digital photo of a tree are the tree. You cannot say that the tree does not have sap because the photo does not have sap. Similarly, you cannot say that God is contingent from the entertainment of an image of God. The image does not show what God is, but it shows what you cannot say that God is not. Because people, made in the image of God, can be stupid does not imply that God is stupid.      God has no procedure of using logic. God knows the procedure of logic that you use. He created it. That procedure, properly used, is whatever God wills it to be. Whatever he wills it to be, it still allows humans to reason from one contingent truth to another within the composite contingent truths that humans understand.      ""Your account of free will means that you can turn into an atheist tomorrow and I can turn into a theist, because that happens to be an unbiased bit of both our 'wills.'

3238,"@ Laudator Temporis Acti,      (continuation)      The following is just a sample of the part of the random subsequence that describes physical reality as we sense it in which, tomorrow, say, 128 ceases to be a power of 2 and 127 becomes composite. It is klutzy because it is just my idea. The klutziness of my idea and the subsequence describing the future are just of me and the model. They therefore do not limit God to a klutzy technique for causing this cchange. In God, the situation where 128 is prime and 127 is prime, is beautiful. And remember, this is a simulation as a computer program. It is logical because the computer is a logic machine with a logical substrate producing all the virtual simulations.      So in tomorrow's representation, when the new subsequence comes into play, whenever the question of prime or composite concerning 127 or 128 arises, the subsequence that is the virtual reality program now also runs the sub-sub- sequence that was missing in the part of the program representing times heretofore. The new stuff just adds 1 to 128 or 127, calculates whether the sum is prime or a power of 2 using the old rules, and pops out the new answer for the numbers before the addition was made.

1893,"@ Norm,      About Elon Musk, I said ""he doesn't spoil his act with prolonged ax grinding against an innocent target"". See that word ""prolonged"" in there? That was inserted with care. In other words I did not claim that he does not go after the innocent as well as the guilty. It is the hammering away at the same person that changes it from humor to something else.      ""I feel it's a bit uncharitable to lay all of the blame at the feet of Pope Francis""      Who has done that? Meanwhile, Francis is the pope now, so his actions will naturally get the most attention.      I have not been criticizing Pope Francis, but ""Amoris Laetitia"" (which you mention), the Pope's communication, has prompted many criticisms of the lack of guidance from the Pope, and if these criticisms were not well founded, the plain, simply spoken guidance becomes all the more important. That people feel the absence of this is a problem. The suffering of people who feel, rightly or wrongly, that the Church is going off the rails needs urgent attention, not ""official"" statements or abstruse theology from people no one has heard of. It needs careful shepherding by the person who issued the letter - the Pope.      That its absence is no excuse for loss or destabilization of faith really says nothing. No one has excuses for their sins, and yet everyone faces attacks caused by imperfect trust in God precisely because we are human, and that is why loving pastoral guidance is needed. ""Let God sort them out, I know why their fears are unjust"" is insufficient. The absence of this guidance is fair game for criticism. The respectful waiting that you advise justifiably grows into real criticism with time. It is in a sense an abandonment of the straying sheep who need to be brought back into the fold.

2413,"""and neither are any of God's perfections and human perfections.""      I disagree with that and you seem to be missing the point of analogy. Of course God is not perfectED but he nevertheless is *literally* perfect in the sense that he eminently possesses (eternally) all of the actualities that creatures come to possess when they are perfected. As I said, it has long been a standard thomistic view to say that God must *formally* possess all pure perfections. This is related to what names we can literally predicate of God with analogy. We don't say that God is wise just because God caused wisdom, just like we don't say God is a cat (though he is the cause of cats and hence has all of their actualities). Wisdom per se does not entail limitations, but on the contrary, an increase in being.      If you want to insist that this is no analogy of proper proportionality etc. and discuss terminology, nevertheless the metaphysical point remains that God must possess all of the actualities/perfections of its creatures (see ST I question 4 for instance), and hence be relevantly like a moral agent unless you think moral agency is intrinsically limiting.      Again, would you say that God is not intelligent? That God is not wise? That God is not free? Just because a perfection is found in a limited and creaturely manner in us, that does not mean it is not a pure perfection per se. The same goes for ""God is a moral agent"".      ""while the notion of moral is also rooted in the notion of custom (or more), which in turn is intrinsically (both conceptually and existentially) dependent upon a framework of human practices and institutions and corresponding ends and modes of excellence""      I completely disagree. To me, moral has to do with the necessary facts of ethics. ""Moral agency"" simply refers to the capacity of beings possessed with intellect and will (and hence freedom) to act in accordance with (or contrary to) the necessary moral facts (such as ""torturing people is wrong/evil""). God absolutely is a moral agent. Again, this has nothing to do with classical theism but rather with whether ""moral agent"" is a pure perfection or not.      And the point remains that when we attribute goodness, and moral goodness, to God (and we do; and in particular, Christian believers must do that) there must be some basic standards which God must fulfill, lest the attribution of goodness becomes equivocal. It would not do to say ""God is most wise!! Omniscient and perfectly knowing!"" and yet have God not actually knowing whether we exist or not. But if God does not care about the suffering of people (to the point where we could prima facie expect him to prevent or stop it) then this God is not ""good"". He might be ""good"" the way a squirrel that has all of its bodily parts is ""good"", but not good in the relevant sense that believers profess him to be - and would, again, strike many of us as a severely defective being (which should be impossible for the Purely Actual source of all existence and perfection). This is all that is needed to get the problem of evil going, however.      It amazes me how some people don't realize that the ""God is not a moral agent"" line not only is metaphysically problematic for many (again, it has to do with moral agency being a pure perfection or not, not with classical theism per se. There are also classical theists that deny there is knowledge in God, after all) but also only ""solves"" the problem of evil at the expense of making God unworthy of love and worship to most believers, as well as a severely defective and limited being to many metaphysicians.",neither perfection human perfection disagree seem missing point analogy course god perfected nevertheless literally perfect sense eminently posse eternally actuality creature come posse perfected said long standard thomistic view say god must formally posse pure perfection related name literally predicate god analogy say god wise god caused wisdom like say god cat though cause cat hence actuality wisdom per se entail limitation contrary increase want insist analogy proper proportionality etc discus terminology nevertheless metaphysical point remains god must posse actualitiesperfections creature see st question instance hence relevantly like moral agent unless think moral agency intrinsically limiting would say god intelligent god wise god free perfection found limited creaturely manner u mean pure perfection per se go god moral agent notion moral also rooted notion custom turn intrinsically conceptually existentially dependent upon framework human practice institution corresponding end mode excellence completely disagree moral necessary fact ethic moral agency simply refers capacity being possessed intellect hence freedom act accordance contrary necessary moral fact torturing people wrongevil god absolutely moral agent nothing classical theism rather whether moral agent pure perfection point remains attribute goodness moral goodness god particular christian believer must must basic standard god must fulfill lest attribution goodness becomes equivocal would say god wise omniscient perfectly knowing yet god actually knowing whether exist god care suffering people point could prima facie expect prevent stop god good might good way squirrel bodily part good good relevant sense believer profess - would strike many u severely defective impossible purely actual source existence perfection needed get problem evil going however amazes people realize god moral agent line metaphysically problematic many moral agency pure perfection classical theism per se also classical theist deny knowledge god also solves problem evil expense making god unworthy love worship believer well severely defective limited many metaphysicians,feser,3613,0

There are two incommensurable goods one better served as one goes in one direction in the spectrum and the other better served as one goes in the other direction in the spectrum. Let’s say that we can quantify the spectrum as one from less to more with respect to some quantity _Q_ (amount of homework, difficulty of a question or length of a walk), and good _A_ is promoted by less of _Q_ and incommensurable good _B_ is promoted by more of _Q_. For instance, with homework, _A_ is the student’s having time for other classes and for non- academic pursuits and _B_ is the student’s learning more about the subject at hand. With exam difficulty, _A_ may be avoiding frustration and _B_ is giving a worthy challenge. With a walk, _A_ is reducing fatigue and _B_ is increasing health benefits.

882,"Vincent,      You mention souls having to be branded by their bodies - nevertheless, once the soul loses the body, it CONTINUES TO EXIST. Which would be sufficient to refute the idea that existence is the same as material exemplifications. That seems obvious to me. If you wanna say things exist because they have matter, you cannot say that a disembodied soul can exist or continue to exist; at most you can say that such a soul has existed before, but no longer exists, if it no longer has matter.   Saying angels also have prime matter is okay but that'd just be another cost for a position that seems implausible and frankly doesn't seem to accomplish much.      ""As for God, His essence and existence are commonly held to be identical, anyway.""      But God is not material. So it just seems bizarre to suggest that existence comes from prime matter.      And overall, I cannot quite make sense of what you are suggesting except if we are just calling ""Existence"" ""Matter"". In that case, the form will be the Essence and Matter will be ""Existence"" and you have only a semantic difference.      The whole point of the Essence x Existence distinction, in a nutshell, is that there is a real actuality that is the ""oomph"" of things existing. When you consider a unicorn, you can understand what it is without knowing whether it actually exists or not. This is so because its existence is not the same as its essence. Sure, the unicorn's existence qua unicorn involves material exemplification, but there might be things which exist without matter (as the examples I gave), and in any case we are just trying to maintain a principle of actuality/reality here. You seem to just be turning that principle into matter. One could make more objections from the nature of prime matter and how it can be changed etc., but it's not even clear to me what you're trying to accomplish with that, and how you would avoid the arguments for a real distinction (if you really are trying to abandon it).      ""What I insist is that God's Mind or Essence has multiple thoughts and intentions which are contingent accidents - e.g. God's concept of this universe, and His intention to make it.""      But where do these accidents come from? They could only be caused by the divine essence, but then God would just be the simple essence anyway. And it seems impossible for the accidents to come about, since they would have to actualize God somehow (in the way accidents actualize the subjects), but God as pure actuality (the simple essence as you admitted) would not be able to be actualized by accidents. To put it differently: I worry that God could only cause himself parts if he already had parts in the first place (a potential to receive the actuality of the accidents/be modified by the accidents), so it would be viciously circular.   Another worry I have is that the First Cause would already prepossess in itself the actualities of the accidents it would cause, but then, what's the point? And it would be the case of a something actualizing itself, which is impossible.      ""an agent's choice to do something must be (at least logically, even if not temporally) preceded by a plan or intention to do it. ""      If intentions do not determine the choice, then it seems you are treating intentions as if they were non-determining motives or predispositions. But then the classical theist can agree that God DOES have these intentions. I certainly believe that, at least. To me, God created this universe because he was impressed by reasons R, and his being impressed by reasons R is not a contingent fact, but a necessary one. God is impressed by R in every world.      So what's the issue? Classical theists need not deny that God has intentions to act. If you accept the fact that God can create different things in different worlds without there having to be any differences in intrinsic properties in God between these worlds as he chooses what to create (something you should accept if you accept LFW) then what is the problem?

It doesn't tell us anything about whether He had good reasons for choice B.

2456,"I agree with Walter that the ""God is good only in an analogical sense, not a univocal one!"" is a horrible and useless defense. As he said, when there is an analogy there is something in common; in particular, in ""God is good"" there is an analogy of proper proportionality. It is not a metaphor. For the classical theist, God is the source of all actualities - and that includes virtues and moral agency -, and as the source of all perfection and pure act God must FORMALLY possess all pure perfections (that is, perfections that in themselves include no limitation), but in an eminent way. The formal possession of pure perfections by God is insisted upon by many thomists (e.g. Garrigou-Lagrange) and is compatible with analogy (again, it's an analogy of proper proportionality).      Therefore, one can only say that ""God is not a moral agent"" or ""God is not virtuous"" if one believes that moral agency and virtue are not pure perfections. But I think it's obvious that they are pure perfections; the fact that moral agency is found in us in a limited, creaturely manner doesn't make it any less of a perfection just like the fact that wisdom is found in us in a changing, limited, creaturely manner doesn't mean wisdom is not a perfection - and the theist certainly says God is wise in a literal way. God is therefore also properly said to be morally good - indeed, morally perfect - and this goodness cannot contradict what seems basic to us with regard to evil, moral value, etc. Just like we wouldn't say God is omniscient if he didn't literally know (e.g.) that we exist. This is also why I think the ""Brian Davies"" line of approaching the PoE is entirely useless. And it has nothing to do with classical theism per se, but rather with moral virtue being or not being a pure perfection. Needless to say, most people would agree that if God does not at all care to stop a child from being tortured, then God is seriously deficient (which should be impossible).      Walter,      That being said, I wonder how you can feel so confident about the presence of suffering on this earth being totally pointless, and that it would be better to have a world (e.g.) without any Fall at any point. Don't you think that lies beyond your cognitive capacities? At the very least, doesn't it give you pause? It is very clear to me that, for instance, a world consisting of nothing but innocent people being tortured without end is a horrible world and God could not make it. But while that is clear, it is not at all clear to me that it would be immoral to have a world in which people suffered for some finite time on earth, and then went on to enjoy a much longer happy afterlife. And it is far from clear to me that the finite sufferings experienced in that world could not end up contributing to making the good end-state better, or just allowing for a good amount of soul-building, etc. I think you should give more credit to skeptical theism.      Don't get me wrong, I do see the strength in the problem of evil. But it seems to me that you are a bit too confident in the idea that there could be no morally sufficient reasons for God to create a world like ours; especially given that we might only know such a small part of life and the world (it could be like judging a whole novel on the basis of the first pages).",agree walter god good analogical sense univocal one horrible useless defense said analogy something common particular god good analogy proper proportionality metaphor classical theist god source actuality - includes virtue moral agency - source perfection pure act god must formally posse pure perfection perfection include limitation eminent way formal possession pure perfection god insisted upon many thomists eg garrigou-lagrange compatible analogy analogy proper proportionality therefore one say god moral agent god virtuous one belief moral agency virtue pure perfection think obvious pure perfection fact moral agency found u limited creaturely manner make le perfection like fact wisdom found u changing limited creaturely manner mean wisdom perfection - theist certainly say god wise literal way god therefore also properly said morally good - indeed morally perfect - goodness contradict seems basic u regard evil moral value etc like say god omniscient literally know eg exist also think brian davy line approaching poe entirely useless nothing classical theism per se rather moral virtue pure perfection needle say people would agree god care stop child tortured god seriously deficient impossible walter said wonder feel confident presence suffering earth totally pointless would better world eg without fall point think lie beyond cognitive capacity least give pause clear instance world consisting nothing innocent people tortured without end horrible world god could make clear clear would immoral world people suffered finite time earth went enjoy much longer happy afterlife far clear finite suffering experienced world could end contributing making good end-state better allowing good amount soul-building etc think give credit skeptical theism get wrong see strength problem evil seems bit confident idea could morally sufficient reason god create world like especially given might know small part life world could like judging whole novel basis first page,feser,3317,0

1470,"Mr. Jindra,      You are spot on that the materialist had not thought through his position, but you are mistaken in thinking that you have thought through yours. Dr. Yogami offers you some help above, some of which I am going to reiterate by explaining the difference between a debate and a lecture.      At a debate you consider whether a particular proposition is true or false. A debate such as the one noted above would normally be in a form such as: whether or not materialism is true. That would be the proposition under consideration and one person would take the affirmative side (i.e. Yes, it is true) and another would take the negative side (i.e. no it is not true).      In such a debate, it is important that the terms are defined. Otherwise, equivocation can occur and the debaters will talk past one another. So, it would be important to clarify that materialism is the assertion that matter is all that there is. Once that is established and the questions are established, folks then make arguments for their positions. That is the way a debate works.      Now what you describe is a situation where you refuse to participate in the debate and stand with your hands crossed. Well, that is not a debate. That is a lecture wherein, in this instance, you sit and listen to Dr. William Lane Craig and learn from him. Now that would be very good for you, but the point is that such a situation is not a debate.      In fact, it would be very awkward for you to stand in front of a crowd with a podium next to Dr. Craig and just gawk at him. You are going to have to say or do something. Now if you say something, you are doing to have to either: a. utter complete non-sense (perhaps you might simply repeat the letter Q over and over again), or b. make an argument for your case. Either way you end up looking like bafoon who cannot offer the slightest support for your position without showing your behind (here you and Walter and Dr. Craig's opponent have something in common).      Now, there is an alternative. Rather than saying something, you could do something. For example, you could do interpretive dance while Dr. Craig makes his arguments. You could do ballet and offer a rendition of the nutcracker. Or you might simply do the macarena. All viable options.      Or, perhaps, you might sit in the audience and learn from Dr. Craig. This last option seems to me the wisest alternative. But, then, we would not have a debate now would we?

Specifically, given a probability function _P_ and a probability discount threshold _ϵ_ , we form a credence function _P_ _ϵ_ by letting _P_ _ϵ_ ( _A_ ) = _P_ ( _A_ ) if _ϵ_ ≤ _P_ ( _A_ ) ≤ 1 − _ϵ_ , _P_ _ϵ_ ( _A_ ) = 0 if _P_ ( _A_ ) < _ϵ_ and _P_ _ϵ_ ( _A_ ) = 1 if _P_ ( _A_ ) > 1 − _ϵ_.

2750,"My concern is not to assess Francis' personal responsibility or guilt (which we would best leave to God), or even to decide where he would stand in a ranking of popes from best to worst.      Rather, I think our aim should be to defend magisterial statements (albeit non-infallible) from charges of error or inconsistency as far as possible.      Quite a number of Francis' difficult statements are non-magisterial, so for these purposes it suffices to point that out in the particular instances.      With magisterial statements, I realise there is the last resort of withholding assent from non-infallible teachings, by someone who is sufficiently qualified and who has sufficient justifiying reasons. But once someone takes that step in one case, it does seem to easily become a habit, and a bottomless pit of doubt and dissent.      The typical Catholic trying to be faithful, and trying to learn more about their faith from Church documents, isn't in a good position to make these assessments, and they would end up with diminished confidence in a vast range of teachings if they became too easily habituated to having to exercise 'private judgment' upon each one.      So to me it's worthwhile, for the sake of both myself and others, to try to find another way if possible.      In this specific matter of whether we should try to 'convert others' - if we too easily take the most 'anti-evangelizing' interpretation of Francis' words, there will be those who will feel obliged to 'obediently accept' his teaching thus interpreted, with detriment to their own evangelizing efforts.

Take for instance the more platonic/dharmic/spiritist view that the soul is a substance whose nature is other than the body and that not only has no necessary conection with it but is actually weakened by being stuck with it. This is pretty straightfoward here: the soul is stuck with the body limitations and so its natural capacities will be worser on a crappier body.      Take now the cartesian view were the soul is a substance whose nature is other than the body but is made to function with the body. Here the sould and the body must function together to it to work well, so a bad body will make the soul less capable of functioning.      Now take the thomistic view were the soul is the form of the body. Here things also work well, for the body is responsable for sense data, memory and imagination and the intellect(that the soul is responsable for) needs sense data everytime it needs to function*, so if the body do not work well, them the sould is screwed.      So it seems that the forms of dualism defended by philosophers, at least with a religious mindset, can work well on this case. The only type of dualism i can't see explaining it is the one you see on most fiction with superhumans or magic were someone can turn into a fly or a bird, say, and still think.

1264,"This is the right approach, however, from what I've read so far it's overcomplicated by Aristotle and Aquinas. The Greek model for human rights is not universal but tied to the idea of AUTOCHTHONY and would JUSTIFY chattel slavery.   Paul addressed AUTOCHTHONY directly in his Mars hill discourse in Acts 17 countering the dispute concerning birth from a particular area to one BLOOD, in law a common human consanguinity which having the evidence of mixed races or ethnicities is evidence of common humanity due therefore common equity (dikaiosune, see Aristotle BOOK 5 NICHOMACHEAN ETHICS).   He then established the common observation that in one theos all live and move and have being which relates back to the first observation that they had many gods each of which protected certain classes of rights when given obeisance. The unknown one Theos being the god upon whom even the other gods demiurgos we're dependent.   Then he established the ideal judge who could advocate the natural rights of those in the image of the invisible Theos who is not in the image or location chosen by men but has established equity in the image of God in the god man in whom are all actual subjective rights obvious by natural law made objective because HE will judge in that equity, justice, righteousness, dikaiosune, mishpat and God has given proof of this by raising him from the dead signifying he is eternal and has the power over life and death for all in his image.   Paul draws this human rights argument directly from the old testament description of messiah the Christ not Greek philosophy he has simply explained it so that greeks could understand it. This is the same structure used in the prologue to John's Gospel, beginning with IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE LOGOS, the logos became flesh, that becoming flesh gave us equity and the authority to claim the title of an inheritance of rights i.e THE SONS OF GOD, our duty then, his law is to love and protect the legitimate rights of others as we love and protect our own rights, knowing these rights came from God by grace and the truth concerning the fact of the matter that is the Christ.   I don't see how philosophy can improve on this although it may help to understand it, but it doesn't improve upon but rather is corrected by the new testament based on the two great commandments with respect to God's rights and our rights in common as neighbors and the explanation in the prophets such as ISAIAH who goes into great detail on the subject of equity of rights in the human image of God YHVHJESUS.

3459,"@ Tadeo:       _They say in the text that the microorganisms that formed the mitochondria were separable in principle - at least they suppose it is that way._      Granting the premise that the theory of endosymbiosis is true, it does nothing to invalidate A-T metaphysics and a lot to support it. I'll go for this: those microorganismos were substances at first ( _per se subsistens_ ), capable of ""independent"" life and then merged. A new organism (substantial form) emerged (new species). The mitochondria would remain there virtually, until through accidental changes it could no longer re-gain (in a natural manner) its independence, becoming an obligate intracellular organelle. (But maybe it could in a laboratory in presence of human beings with adequate technology).      2 questions for the darwinian: what does the environment in which a mitochondrion lived prior to the fusion had to do with the intracellular environment in which it found itself after the fusion?? If organisms adapt to their niches, the extracellular life of the mitochondrial organism would have had very little in common with the metabolic machinery of the cytoplasm of the host. Of course these people can elaborate an unfalsifiable nice just-so sory about how it did happen and the ""powers"" of Natural Selection,* but that's garbage science and should not be tolerated.

1661,"I have read Hart's ""That All Shall Be Saved"" and as far as I remember nothing in his argument required necessitarianism of any kind.      Yes, he did argue that it is IMPOSSIBLE for human beings to be damned. And yes, in a way he did argue that it was IMPOSSIBLE for God not to save all the people he had made, given God's moral perfection. But again, both of these propositions are fully compatible with God deciding to not create anything at all, or deciding to create a universe with no people. The only thing that follows from the impossibility of eternal damnation is the impossibility of eternal damnation, not that God absolutely had to create our universe and save everyone, or even had to create (and save) any people.      Whether Hart actually defends necessitarianism in other works might very well be possible. But it is completely irrelevant for universalism as well as his specific argument.      Fr. Rooney says ""If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something makes it so..."" but again, when universalists say that it is necessary that God will save everyone, they are speaking of a conditional necessity, I.e. GIVEN that God has created people, it is impossible that he would then fail to save all of them. The universalist is not saying that it is necessary for God to CREATE any world or a specific world and then save everyone; he is just saying it is impossible for God to create people and then have them be lost forever to eternal damnation or annihilation.

2910,"Someone explain ""measure"" to me in Aquinas. Like I'm five. Well maybe 25. This section of De Veritate for example:      Note, however, that a thing is referred differently to the practical intellect than it is to the speculative intellect.

But, since the speculative intellect is receptive in regard to things, it is, in a certain sense, moved by things and consequently measured by them. It is clear, therefore, that, as is said in the Metaphysics, natural things from which our intellect gets its scientific knowledge measure our intellect. Yet these things are themselves measured by the divine intellect, in which are all created things—just as all works of art find their origin in the intellect of an artist. The divine intellect, therefore, measures and is not measured; a natural thing both measures and is measured; but our intellect is measured, and measures only artifacts, not natural things.      Is a measure, measures, is measured...what is happening? I think ""measure"" and I picture someone with a ruler walking up to a sofa or whatever and thinking: I wonder if that will fit in my living room. Hm. I will measure it and then we will see. That's it. But Aquinas is taking some basic meaning of this word and extending it to a host of other things, and I can't quite grasp what that is.

It manifests his goodness in so far as his mercy is enough to restore even the most broken of souls and we do see examples of this. The way in which God has arranged things does give way to a lot of instances where he brings a greater good out of all the evil that is taken place, the most stark example being the crucifixion which God used to manifest his infinite mercy. Pope John Paul II as well as Thomas Aquinas have both referred to God's mercy has his greatest attribute, that attribute which displays his goodness in the greatest way since God is below no one. And to top it all it was implemented by means of an Incarnation. All these great goods would not have been possible to us in a world without sin even if an Incarnation had taken place in that world because God's mercy would have been conceivable to us only by contemplating the act of creation which would be very abstract. In this world his mercy was on its fullest display. We deserved punishment but God gave us the opposite.   Having said all that though, I think these instances serve to show us that God can indeed bring greater goods out of great evils and we can trust him in that regard. They form parts of the reason why God has permitted suffering. And it's true in a general sense. At the same time there are such ghastly acts that humans commit, that it's hard to believe that God allowed that person to suffer like that just because doesn't want that person to get attached to this world, it's even worse to propose that it was deserved as punishment. In such cases solace should be derived from the fact that even such ghastly trauma can be healed by God's mercy and at the same time refrain from attributing any reason to God for permitting it since we truly aren't in a position to know why. God himself points to our cluelessness in the book of Job. In previous posts on suffering Prof usually did underscore this point regarding particular cases atleast up untill last years Christmas message where he posited that we can't fathom why God has permitted the crisis in church to go on for so long.

1838,"Now, one point that some readers have made is that the word “heresy” was used in a more expansive way earlier in Church history than it is today. That is correct and important, and it is something [I have elsewhere emphasized myself](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2019/05/popes-heresy-and-papal- heresy.html). In modern canon law, heresy is “the obstinate denial or obstinate doubt after the reception of baptism of some truth which is to be believed by divine and Catholic faith.” Pope Honorius was definitely _not_ a heretic in that sense, both because there is no evidence of obstinacy on his part, and because a charitable reading of his problematic statements supports the judgment that he did not intend to undermine traditional teaching (even if his words inadvertently had that effect). There are also the related points that one could be a heretic in the _material_ sense of affirming something doctrinally erroneous, while not being a _formal_ heretic in the sense of persisting in the error even after being warned by ecclesiastical authority; and that whether some doctrine has actually been defined by the Church is relevant to whether it is “to be believed by divine and Catholic faith.”",one point reader made word “ heresy ” used expansive way earlier church history today correct important something elsewhere emphasized myselfhttpsedwardfeserblogspotcompopes-heresy-and-papal- heresyhtml modern canon law heresy “ obstinate denial obstinate doubt reception baptism truth believed divine catholic faith ” pope honorius definitely heretic sense evidence obstinacy part charitable reading problematic statement support judgment intend undermine traditional teaching even word inadvertently effect also related point one could heretic material sense affirming something doctrinally erroneous formal heretic sense persisting error even warned ecclesiastical authority whether doctrine actually defined church relevant whether “ believed divine catholic faith ”,feser,1204,0

He led a mechanical, regular, almost abstract bachelor existence in a little retired street of Königsberg, an old town on the north-eastern frontier of Germany. I do not believe that the great clock of the cathedral performed in a more passionless and methodical manner its daily routine than did its townsman, Immanuel Kant. Rising in the morning, coffee-drinking, writing, reading lectures, dining, walking, everything had its appointed time, and the neighbors knew that it was exactly half-past three o'clock when Kant stepped forth from his house in his grey, tight-fitting coat, with his Spanish cane in his hand, and betook himself to the little linden avenue called after him to this day the ""Philosopher's Walk."" Summer and winter he walked up and down it eight times, and when the weather was dull or heavy clouds prognosticated rain, the townspeople beheld his servant, the old Lampe, trudging anxiously behind Kant with a big umbrella under his arm, like an image of Providence.      What a strange contrast did this man's outward life present to his destructive, world-annihilating thoughts! In sooth, had the citizens of Königsberg had the least presentiment of the full significance of his ideas, they would have felt far more awful dread at the presence of this man than at the sight of an executioner, who can but kill the body. But the worthy folk saw in him nothing more than a Professor of Philosophy, and as he passed at his customary hour, they greeted him in a friendly manner and set their watches by him.”   (End quote)",post reminded heinrich comment lifephilosophy quote book religion philosophy germany fragment page - online version httpsarchiveorgdetailsreligionandphiloheinuoftpagemodeup “ history immanuel life difficult portray neither life history led mechanical regular almost abstract bachelor existence little retired street königsberg old town north-eastern frontier germany believe great clock cathedral performed passionless methodical manner daily routine townsman immanuel kant rising morning coffee-drinking writing reading lecture dining walking everything appointed time neighbor knew exactly half-past three clock kant stepped forth house grey tight-fitting coat spanish cane hand betook little linden avenue called day philosopher walk summer winter walked eight time weather dull heavy cloud prognosticated rain townspeople beheld servant old lampe trudging anxiously behind kant big umbrella arm like image providence strange contrast outward life present destructive world-annihilating thought sooth citizen königsberg least presentiment full significance idea would felt far awful dread presence man sight executioner kill body worthy folk saw nothing professor philosophy passed customary hour greeted friendly manner set watch ” end quote,feser,1925,0

1911,"Melkman, you seem to be fusing two different issues: the first is the difference between material heresy and formal heresy. Material heresy is believing X when the Church has taught not-X. You can do this by merely NOT KNOWING that the Church has taught not-X. Formal heresy adds to the material heresy the necessary spiritual ingredient of holding the proposition X obstinately, in the face of the Church's teaching, being aware _that the Church teaches not-X_. This is the sin of heresy in its formal aspect.      Then there is another distinction, having the sin of heresy, versus the ecclesiastical crime of heresy. If you obstinately hold X, but _never tell or act on that belief_ , you could not be held guilty in a Church court for the ecclesiastical crime, because there would be no knowledge of the fact. So your heresy could become publicly declared. So it would not be ""formally"" determined heresy, by which you mean "" **officially** NAMED 'the sin of heresy' by the Church"".      And then there is the distinction between holding an X where the Church has taught not-X, but in which not-X is _not a formally defined dogma to be affirmed with Catholic faith, or a definitive teaching ""to be held"" unreservedly_ but a lesser position, taught (""merely"") as a firm tradition. While a Church court might find you guilty of some crime or other in publicly asserting X, it wouldn't necessarily be that of ""heresy"" as defined in the canons. For the latter, the teaching of not-X must be a definitive one, a teaching on which the Church has **definitively** resolved the debate. So, you could be found obstinately sinful in holding error, but not that of "" **formally defined** "" error.      Your point seems to be that even if the position stated by Honorius was actually material heresy, (a) maybe he wasn't guilty of the obstinacy necessary for the sin, and (b) nobody in the Church could have successfully carried out an ecclesiastical trial to _determine_ his guilty status so that it could be OFFICIALLY DECLARED to be ""heresy"" to all. erick below points out the additional issue that the true answer had not yet been defined.      To all of this, I will submit: the point of this post is not to answer whether a pope might be _officially declared_ a heretic, or whether a pope might hold a position that had already been _officially defined_ to be wrong, but to discuss whether a pope might ever hold (and teach) what is, materially, erroneous, on faith and morals; and do so when he _should have known better_ even if the Church had not yet officially defined the issue.",melkman seem fusing two different issue first difference material heresy formal heresy material heresy believing x church taught not-x merely knowing church taught not-x formal heresy add material heresy necessary spiritual ingredient holding proposition x obstinately face teaching aware church teach not-x sin heresy formal aspect another distinction sin heresy versus ecclesiastical crime heresy obstinately hold x never tell act belief could held guilty church court ecclesiastical crime would knowledge fact heresy could become publicly declared would formally determined heresy mean officially named sin church distinction holding x church taught not-x not-x formally defined dogma affirmed catholic faith definitive teaching held unreservedly lesser position taught merely firm tradition church court might find guilty crime publicly asserting x necessarily heresy defined canon latter teaching not-x must definitive one teaching church definitively resolved debate could found obstinately sinful holding error formally defined error point seems even position stated honorius actually material heresy maybe guilty obstinacy necessary sin b nobody church could successfully carried ecclesiastical trial determine guilty status could officially declared heresy erick point additional issue true answer yet defined submit point post answer whether pope might officially declared heretic whether pope might hold position already officially defined wrong discus whether pope might ever hold teach materially erroneous faith moral known better even church yet officially defined issue,feser,2581,0

For example, many cases of horrendous suffering caused by some diseases; sexual abuse and torture; etc. The list could go on and on. And Christians do believe that God does, in fact, sometimes prevent or stop said evils through (for example) miracles or providence. So it is a problem why there are still so many of these evils going on and our loving Father does nothing about it - not even when people desperately or earnestly pray and beg him for help.

3424,"While I hold a lot of skepticism about McGinn's use of mysterianism on the hard problem of conscious thought, as a Cathlolic I also would tend to be very, very cautious about castigating mysterianism _altogether_. After all, we Catholics are in the position of positing that without the grace of faith, we **could not know** that God is a trinity of persons, and further that we cannot really _understand_ (fully) the Trinity in our present state (behind the veil, through a glass darkly).      Suffice it to say: we cannot invoke mysterianism _merely_ because it is a hard problem. There must be a properly accounted reason that _explains_ our inability to access the thoughts needed. In the case of God, we are limited intelligences, and he is unlimited intelligence, and so our minds are not of a nature capable (on their own) of encompassing the whole of God. But that account doesn't work for our own minds: presumably, the nature and workings of our minds are correlative to _our minds_.      However, it may be possible to argue that we cannot _in principle_ access the way our minds work **directly** , because when we are thinking an immaterial thought (say, about pi), we cannot ALSO be thinking second-layer thinking _about_ that thought, (at least, without the danger of disturbing and ending the thought about pi in order to think the thought ABOUT the thought about pi. So, (arguably) we could only ever, at best, draw the conclusions about consciousness in terms of _indirect_ considerations, rather than via direct access / observation.

So anyone who wishes to defend Honorius, which usually tends to be the Sedevecantist or Ultramontanist types, can never accomplish their goal. If they were to deny that the Church held the teaching, then they must concede that Popes who tacitly implied/promoted and approved of the belief that a Pope might err, had actually erred.

3262,"Dr. Ed Feser gives a brief rundown of the “error” and condemnation of Pope Honorius I (625-638). He draws mostly from the Patristic scholarship of great Fr. John Chapman who was a remarkable scholar on the early Papacy and the issues related to the Latin vs Byzantine Churches throughout the first seven ecumenical Councils. In my own research, I have come to think that Fr. Chapman’s is perhaps the best sketch and explanation of the events surrounding Honorius. There can be no question that Pope St. Leo II, the very Pope who confirmed the decrees of the Council of Constantinople III (681), that is, the very council which had accused Pope Honorius of heresy, believed that his predecessor Honorius had committed a heresy. There can be no question that, including Constantinople III, three more ecumenical synods repeated the anathema against Honorius for heresy. Moreover, in the Roman Breviary, up until the 18th century, included a description of Honorius as a “heretic” for June 28th, the feast of the Pope who executed Honorius’s condemnation (St. Leo II). There also can be no question that these Councils, Popes, theologians, canonists, and general Christian thinkers understood Honorius as a heretic. Though, you have some exceptions.      One thing that Feser does not venture deeply into is the question of what kind of “heretical crime” was proven at the Council in 681 over Honorius, a man who had died 42 years prior to its convocation. At best, Honorius can be convicted of material heresy since the form added to the matter of heresy has to be proven. Moreover, since the doctrine of two-wills in Christ was not definitively settled, even a material heresy in this regard (according to Catholicism’s developed canon law) could not, of itself, situate one into the canonical crime of heresy nor the status of mortal sin. Otherwise, we would have to anathematize the person and memory of St Thomas Aquinas for his rejection of the Immaculate Conception. But that is impossible since Pope Sixtus condemned anyone who would accuse another for mortal sin or canonical heresy when the matter had not yet been resolved by the Apostolic See. While the Council of Constantinople III cannot be said to have worked with these parameters, those parameters did become standard and acceptable to Catholic canon law, jurisprudence, and pastoral theory. It is practical today.      What lessons, asks Feser, can be drawn from Honorius for us today? I think the most that can be drawn is that a Pope can commit a doctrinal error. But that a Pope could become teach heresy and thereby become a formal heretic is not illustrated by the Honorius-event. One might argue that the Honorius-event lends great precedent that such a thing could, in theory, happen. But there is nothing in the Honorius-event, according to developed Catholic beliefs on the nature of heresy and its criminality, that illustrates that precedent. Now, if we revert back to the standards of the Latin and Greek policies during the 7th century, then it is a foregone conclusion, a Pope can become a formal heretic. But it seems to me that we cannot ignore the canonical, theological, and pastoral developments that have taken place since Honorius to the present day.      For a more relevant historical context wherein a Pope committed an error while in office, coupling form and matter (but perhaps not pertinacity), you would have to study the Three Chapters controversy under Emperor Justinian regarding the Constituta of Pope Vigilius.      PS. For the life of me, when I read Honorius’s letters, my own private judgment does not see him as a true Monothelite.

Charging Feser with this as his motive is just plain idiotic.      If Feser has not credibly identified the real Catholic response to CRT, then his attack on CRT cannot be identified with ""Catholicism"" anyway. If, however, Feser has credibly identified the real Catholic response to CRT, then he won't be **_dragging_** Catholic thought anywhere, mainstream or not.      Moreover, Feser is well aware that _real_ Catholic principles and thinking have been rejected by the mainstream in the West for decades now, and nothing he does is likely to affect the ""mainstream"" anyway.

He quickly realized that empiricism is dumb, for we do have necessary knowledge, so he was a sort of rationalist early. Necessary knowledge comes from reason.      But them Kant understood that sense data is pretty much how we have information about reality, so if our necessary knowledge does not come from the senses them it either:      1\. Has no basis on reality and is mere play with definitions(which smart empiricists do defend).      2\. Come from something else.      The prussian argued that at least mathematics is a sort of necessary knowledge that is not created by language, so 2 won. His answer was that we can know some truths about how we happen to organize sense data by analysing the necessary conditions to our experience to it to be how it is. For instance, every experience we have is in time, it has a sucession and all that, so we can derive several truths about that(inded, mathematics would have his origin on the forms of time and space).

If the tree of life was unique, it might have been enough for Adam and Eve to eat from, but it would never have been enough for all of the animals of the world to eat from. This may be another sign that the animals were not understood to have the tree of life for their food. If so, then the text of Genesis itself would suggest that, while man was meant to be immortal, animals were not. That would support the idea, based on St. Paul’s statement, that it was human death that entered the world through the Fall, not animal death.      Furthermore, we should note that giving “every green plant” to animals as food does not mean that some of them weren’t also carnivores. It’s not as if, before original sin, lions ate dandelions and toadstools and only afterward did they begin picking on poor old wildebeest. This is something Thomas Aquinas wrote about in his Summa Theologica:      In the opinion of some, those animals which now are fierce and kill others, would, in that state, have been tame, not only in regard to man, but also in regard to other animals.

399,"Initially, I also thought the following was an appealing solution: It matters whether it is the same bystander who is pushed in front of the trolley each time or a different one. Pushing the same bystander repeatedly unjustly imposes a likely-lethal burden on them, and that is wrong. But it would be permissible to push a _different_ bystander each time onto the track, even though it is still almost certain that eventually a bystander will die. The problem with this solution is this. When the sad situation is repeated with different bystanders, by adopting the policy of pushing the bystander, we are basically setting up a lethal lottery for the bystanders—one of them will be killed. But if we can do that, then it seems we could set up a lethal lottery a different way: Choose a random bystander out of, say, 500, and then keep on pushing that bystander. (Remember that the way the story was set up, death is the only possible injury, so don’t think of that bystander as getting more and more bruised; they are unscathed until they die.) But that doesn’t seem any different from just pushing the same bystander without any lottery, because it is pretty much random which human being will end up being the bystander.",initially also thought following appealing solution matter whether bystander pushed front trolley time different one pushing bystander repeatedly unjustly imposes likely-lethal burden wrong would permissible push different bystander time onto track even though still almost certain eventually bystander die problem solution sad situation repeated different bystander adopting policy pushing bystander basically setting lethal lottery bystanders—one killed seems could set lethal lottery different way choose random bystander say keep pushing bystander remember way story set death possible injury think bystander getting bruised unscathed die seem different pushing bystander without lottery pretty much random human end bystander,pruss,1223,1

1809,"Implying that a Pope can teach heresy when not speaking ex cathedra - simply because Vatican I defined that ex cathedra statements cannot be heretical - seems a classic logical flaw of making the conclusion broader than the premises.      The Seventh Oecumenical Council could not evaluate the writings of Pope Honorius as heretical, not only because they weren’t, but because there was no discussion of these writings. If it accepted the history that Honorius was a heretic, it got it wrong.      Vatican I, which left nothing to implication, explained how we ought to interpret its deliberations. Because it defined that all the Popes had “unfailing faith”, the expressions contained in the deliberations of the Seventh Oecumenical Council should be understood as the censure of the extremely negligent behaviour that it was; the term heretic was not as specific then as it later would be. The sense of Vatican I in defining Papal infallibility is obvious; it is prefaced with Christ’s prayer that Peter’s faith would not fail, not merely that he might speak infallibly one a century. Rather than put a strict modern theological understanding of the term heresy into the mouths of prelates in ancient times, we need to apply the modern Church understanding of the Papacy; there is no getting around this.      Whether or not one can be accused of being a heretic for “not resisting an error” and “not defending the truth, one is NOT a heretic because of those things; Pope Felix III, cited in the post, has just explained how to view quite possible uses (which do not convey the understanding of a heretical Pope as we discuss it) of the term heretic in his times!

The geometry of the surface of a sphere goes back to the Greek mathematitions of classic Greece in the 5th century BC.      ""However, the differing accounts of infallibility do PROVE that humans can be wrong about infallibility.""      You are hiding behind a funny obsession about infallibility. The joke is that it amounts to a useless and ridiculous infinite regress. I.e. ""You are not infallible about that"" ... ""Yes, but you are not infallible about _that_"" ... ""Sure, but you are absolutely not infallible about_THAT_, etc, etc, etc ad infinitum.      Humans are going to talk about things anyway. If you are going to try to block these things by saying ""not infallible"", why not say nothing because you are not infallible either.      Sheesh!      :-)      ""But can he create a physical universe containing 127 and 128 in which the former is not prime and the latter is not a power of 2?""      Yes.      Every created thing is an image of God even though the created thing may not seem like God at all. We say that the image exists pre-eminently in God. So if one says a house is like the architect who designed it, we say that the house exists pre-eminently as an image in the mind of the architect, and he creates his observable plan drawings from the unobservable image in his mind and the house is built from these drawings by his agent, the carpenter. So the house is an image of the architect. This is straight out of Aquinas.      In the same way, I can specify a model, or image, of God. The model exists pre-eminently in God and is like Him, even though it is just me who specifies the model. God is not limited by the limitations of the model, but what can be shown in the model exists pre-eminently in God.      The model, or likeness, is an infinite unbiased binary sequence of 50/50 bits. All finite subsequences exist within this infinite sequence. If the consecutive binary digits are each 50/50, then the infinite sequence is a normal sequence. Even so, any subsequence of specified finite length could be missing a particular sub-sub-sequence of itself because such a subsequence itself must appear normally within the infinite sequence. Therefore, discovery by bitwise examination of a subsequence of finite length, no matter how long, that misses a particular sub-sub-sequence cannot be a demonstration that the infinite sequence is not normal.      A description of finite space and time is encoded by a finite subsequence of the infinite normal sequence. A computer that can run the subsequence as a program, including memory, could virtually reproduce all that we experience of reality, given the finite resolution of our senses in time and space. We would not be able to tell whether a missing sub-sub-sequence would exist further along in time in which the rules of arithmetic are no longer what they were. Since the infinite sequence is of random bits, the rules of arithmetic really are not rules. They have just appeared to be rules by random chance. The model, as explained, does not specify God or God's will. So we cannot say from the model whether God could change what appeared to be rules of arithmetic into completely different rules where 128 is not a power of 2 and 127 is a composite number.

3374," **But the same sorts of thing occur in reverse,** when you judge and evil man to be innocent: in respect of the **mere judgment itself** neither harm nor benefit befalls anyone else, including him. But as soon as you act on the judgment by according him trust as if he were innocent, when he is guilty, you harm _whatever project hinged_ on according him that trust. This usually means harm to yourself (because, usually, you will be a participant in that project), or it COULD be many other people besides yourself. You therefore are **JUST AS LIKELY** to harm yourself and others in this way as in the first case above. The two are entirely analogous.      To look at it from a non-personal perspective: in a court of criminal law, regarding penalties that the law might impose, the judge (or jury) applies a standard of ""innocent until proven guilty"" and a standard of needing guilt to be established ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". But in a civil suit, the judge applies a DIFFERENT STANDARD: the award of damages or benefits is based on a mere _preponderance of the evidence""_ , i.e. wherever the stronger argument lies, there is where the judgment lies. And the judge MUST render a judgment that will be to the detriment (i.e. ""harm"") one of the two parties. Therefore, he must harm one and benefit the other on the basis of merely _whichever is one more probably in the right (has the better argument)_ , he cannot choose to opt out of judging.      Here's the thing: The ""court of public opinion"" and personal judgments are similar to each other in this - that they are RIGHTLY not restricted to bringing conclusions only with evidence showing ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". They both RIGHTLY make judgments based (at least much closer to) on a mere _preponderance of the evidence_ , OR EVEN LESS! And this applies to the vast, vast array of social and civic decisions we must make: I choose not to enter into a repair contract with this roofing contractor because ""he felt slimy to me"", and nothing more specific than that, is a **perfectly appropriate** judgment to make. I don't even have to be judging him to be ""slimy"" as being ""more likely than not"" (i.e. above 50%), it would be sufficient for me to do it based on a lower scale, like 20% or 30% likelihood, because I can go find another contractor whom I estimate is far less likely to be slimy, perhaps ""less than 5%"". Thus I ""harm"" the first contractor based on a very modest basis of evidence, and do so with complete legitimacy.      You might recast this judgment as being not ""he IS slimy"" but rather ""there is a 30% probability he is slimy"", but that doesn't prevent (a) that you made a negative judgment and a negative CHOICE affecting him, and (b) your choice does him harm (in some sense). So recasting it that way still causes the judgment to fall under St. Thomas's stated opprobrium, even though it is manifestly a right kind of judging.      The only way to repair the argument Thomas gives is to reframe it as: it is wrong to make FIRMER judgments (against) someone than the evidence (you have) allows for. And the certain wrongness here lies **primarily in its defiance to the virtues of truth** , and not ""harm to the person.” The virtues of truth (e.g. prudence) would have you make DUE judgments that the evidence allows for, and WITHHOLD from firmer opinions than the evidence allows, and when you violate that, you _harm yourself_ first, before harming some other. Due judgments may well rely on less-than-solid evidence, if they are less-than- solid _judgments_ (i.e. when they are held as opinions). Withholding from making judgments on incomplete evidence is ALSO a failure of prudence, when a judgment is needed regardless of the state of the evidence. Commanders in battle must often make judgments of the enemies tactical object when the evidence is far from solid, they cannot just wait until they have proof or even something close to it.",sort thing occur reverse judge evil man innocent respect mere judgment neither harm benefit befalls anyone else including soon act judgment according trust innocent guilty harm whatever project hinged according trust usually mean harm usually participant project could many people besides therefore likely harm others way first case two entirely analogous look non-personal perspective court criminal law regarding penalty law might impose judge jury applies standard innocent proven guilty standard needing guilt established beyond reasonable doubt civil suit judge applies different standard award damage benefit based mere preponderance evidence ie wherever stronger argument lie judgment lie judge must render judgment detriment ie harm one two party therefore must harm one benefit basis merely whichever one probably right better argument choose opt judging thing court public opinion personal judgment similar - rightly restricted bringing conclusion evidence showing beyond reasonable doubt rightly make judgment based least much closer mere preponderance evidence even le applies vast vast array social civic decision must make choose enter repair contract roofing contractor felt slimy nothing specific perfectly appropriate judgment make even judging slimy likely ie would sufficient based lower scale like likelihood go find another contractor estimate far le likely slimy perhaps le thus harm first contractor based modest basis evidence complete legitimacy might recast judgment slimy rather probability slimy prevent made negative judgment negative choice affecting b choice harm sense recasting way still cause judgment fall st stated opprobrium even though manifestly right kind judging way repair argument thomas give reframe wrong make firmer judgment someone evidence allows certain wrongness lie primarily defiance virtue truth harm person ” virtue truth eg prudence would make due judgment evidence allows withhold firmer opinion evidence allows violate harm first harming due judgment may well rely less-than-solid evidence less-than- solid judgment ie held opinion withholding making judgment incomplete evidence also failure prudence judgment needed regardless state evidence commander battle must often make judgment enemy tactical object evidence far solid wait proof even something close,feser,3929,0

1579,"The reason there is such a category as “heresy” in Christianity, whereas there is no such category in purely philosophical systems, is that Christianity claims to be grounded in special divine revelation. Anything that purports to be a Christian position must be consistent with that revelation, and the notion of heresy is the notion of that which is not consistent with it. Now, a Christian theologian who is accused of heresy might, of course, reasonably question whether the charge is just. He can try to show that his position is, when correctly understood, compatible with Christian revelation. But what he _cannot_ reasonably do is dismiss considerations of orthodoxy and heresy _tout court_. Again, by virtue of calling himself a Christian, he is committed to staying within the bounds of the revelation, and thus avoiding heresy.

Creation is eternally happening. Caused by God. See Augustine's ""Confessions - Book XI"". Augustine never took all of this to its logical ends.. He never realized his claim that God did not cause our actions good or bad was logically and rationally wrong.      Augustine had some large conceptual blind spots. Which is theology's basic problem.

2685,"I don't think people most people actually understand the accusation if pantheism they're making. An identification of God with Existence or, to use more platonic language, The One (The Good), cannot in principle be a pantheistic conception, since the world is obviously a complex and changing object. Panentheism may fit better, but even here outside of emanating from a singular object, due to the absolute simplicity of the absolute, it's impossible for the world to be a part of it, it lacks the parts with which anything outside of it could ever truly be related to it. Arguably, the platonist conception of the absolute is even simpler than Aristotle's unmoved mover, for the reason that Plotinus argues against Aristotle's idea of it being Thinking thinking about thoughts. Whether it's correct or not, Plotinus argues that every kind of knowledge involves minimal composition. In that sense, the One cannot be an intellect, which doesn't mean though that it's wholly unmental.      It may be easier for me than for others here since, even though I'd call myself Christian, I have zero emotional investment in the religion and would be indifferent to dropping it, but the accusation that a lofty conception of God removes any kind of personal relation, for me, just shows that we too heavily rely on a, frankly, infantile conception of the supreme being, instead of following the intellectual route of letting ourselves be led into complete apophaticism, in the footsteps of Plotinus and Pseudo-Dionysius. What would knowledge be if it doesn't change? Well, not the knowledge of truths we know it, but acts that *produce* these truths. The convergence with existence and the ultimate dependency of everything on it entails that at the grass roots of knowledge, power or morality, these concepts are entailed by existence/goodness. This is just the logical consequence, something O'Conner hinted at in his book on the contingency argument. Furthermore in regards to knowledge I'd once again reference Barry Miller who quotes Patrick Grim, the idea of omniscience as propositional knowledge (P is true, God knows that P), is not a conception that can be applied to God, this just leads to contradictions.

2102,"It doesn’t seem to me, though, that Chomsky’s specific way of making the point about pseudo-questions is likely to convince someone who doesn’t already agree that the so-called “hard problem” is a pseudo-problem. The reason is that questions like “What is it like to see a sunset?,” and “What is it like to see red?” seem to me interpretable in ways that _are_ susceptible of an answer. For example, if you had never seen the color red, you might naturally ask precisely a question like the second one. And if someone then showed you a red object, you would surely think that your question had been answered. Or, if someone said “Well, it’s sort of like seeing dark orange, though not quite. But very different from seeing pale blue,” then you might judge this answer to be at least somewhat illuminating.",seem though specific way making point pseudo-questions likely convince someone already agree so-called “ hard problem ” pseudo-problem reason question like “ like see sunset ” “ like see red ” seem interpretable way susceptible answer example never seen color red might naturally ask precisely question like second one someone showed red object would surely think question answered someone said “ well sort like seeing dark orange though quite different seeing pale blue ” might judge answer least somewhat illuminating,feser,805,0
291,"Alexander R Pruss: ""there is no objective reason to do or believe anything""      You cannot believe anything at will. Nor are your choices to do something are ever free, even if they seem to be so. All your beliefs and choices to act are predetermined by your genetic makeup and past experiences, which express themselves in the current emotional/cognitive (that is, biochemical) state of your brain. This hypothesis is simpler than to suppose some immaterial stuff, whose interaction with material things, including the brain, would be beyond comprehension.   Also note that being rational is not somehow ""inherently better"" than being irrational or arational. Rather, it's just that rationality is the kind of attitude that pays off most of the time in the long run. And even this ""paying-off"" translates to things that support the survival of the individual, so it can be expressed in value-neutral terms.      ""every reason expresses the value of the thing it is a reason for""   This is false.   For example, if you know that p, and also know that ""if p, then q"", then this knowledge, together with knowledge of the rule of inference ""modus ponens"" may be a reason for you to believe (and, also know) that q. But there is nothing that expresses the ""value of q"" in the state of knowing p, ""if p, then q"", or in knowing ""modus ponens"", nor in its application. They are just propositions, syntactic structures with semantic interpretation according to classical logic. And there are many other alternative systems of logic, even some where modus ponens is not a theorem.",alexander r pruss objective reason believe anything believe anything choice something ever free even seem belief choice act predetermined genetic makeup past experience express current emotionalcognitive biochemical state brain hypothesis simpler suppose immaterial stuff whose interaction material thing including brain would beyond comprehension also note rational somehow inherently better irrational arational rather rationality kind attitude pay time long run even paying-off translates thing support survival individual expressed value-neutral term every reason express value thing reason false example know p also know p q knowledge together knowledge rule inference modus ponens may reason believe also know q nothing express value q state knowing p p q knowing modus ponens application proposition syntactic structure semantic interpretation according classical logic many alternative system logic even modus ponens theorem,pruss,1572,1

3359,"Obviously, one can go too far. A virtue is a mean between extremes, and just as one can be too _quick_ to attribute evil to others, so too can one be too _slow_ to do so. Aquinas does not say that we should _never_ judge another to have a bad motive. He says that we should not do so _if_ we lack sufficient evidence to make a certain judgment about the matter, _if_ our judgment tends to be clouded by dislike of the person, and so on. But with some people, it is possible dispassionately and objectively to judge from their patterns of behavior over time that they are indeed acting from bad motives. There is no sin in making such a judgment under such circumstances. On the contrary, a habitual refusal to do so can be a vice. As [I have discussed elsewhere](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2019/11/against-candy-ass- christianity.html), Aquinas argues that just as one can sin by being excessively angry or insufficiently affable or friendly, so too can one sin by being _insufficiently_ angry and _excessively_ affable in the face of grave evil. Dogmatic non-judgmentalism would be a similar moral failing. It is not Christ’s teaching, but a distortion of that teaching.",obviously one go far virtue mean extreme one quick attribute evil others one slow aquinas say never judge another bad motive say lack sufficient evidence make certain judgment matter judgment tends clouded dislike person people possible dispassionately objectively judge pattern behavior time indeed acting bad motif sin making judgment circumstance contrary habitual refusal vice discussed elsewherehttpsedwardfeserblogspotcomagainst-candy-ass- christianityhtml aquinas argues one sin excessively angry insufficiently affable friendly one sin insufficiently angry excessively affable face grave evil dogmatic non-judgmentalism would similar moral failing teaching distortion teaching,feser,1177,0

1848," _That said, perhaps in favor of Feser's stance, I think one could say that we need to accept the judgment of a council on the presumption they got it right, even if we recognize that in principle it could be corrected later by a proper authority, We could in fact even adduce evidence for why such a later correction could be justified._      I admit I might be wrong on this point, but even this seems a little too strong to me. It is simply a fact that on matters of history - which the condemnation of Honorius is - it is in no way impious to judge that the Council was wrong. One should do it respectfully, as the Saints Dr. Feser references do, but you can absolutely question such judgments. If that were not so, then Maximos, Bellarmie, and Alphonsus Liguori wouldn't question it.      For example, Trent says that their teaching on indulgences goes back to the time of the Apostles*. It is not impious to point out that this is a *historical* claim about indulgences and simply incorrect.      We do largely agree though, and perhaps I'm pushing too hard.      *I got this from Fr.

3273,"I want to pick up on something that Todd said, above:      _authoritative magisterium (i.e. non-infallible)_      I have seen phrases similar to this in many comments (not just blog comments, but (probably even more) news articles and editorial comments in published sources. I want to cry 'foul' on the idea of an ""authoritative magisterium"" of the pope, being somehow a distinct category from his other stuff that he teaches that is, you know, NOT ""authoritative"" or not ""magisterial"" or not ""authoritatively magisterial"".      **There ain't no sich category"".**      At least, that's what I am inclined to argue, though I am willing to be given better material to become educated on the issue.      Pope's generally don't go around stating which of their teachings are ""authoritative"" or ""magisterial"". By coming from a bishop, they automatically _participate_ in the magisterial office of the Church. That's it. All bishops participate in that office, and they are all _authoritative_ when they exercise their authority to teach. Period.      The bishops (all of them) _must necessarily_ participate in the magisterial office of the Church in order to be the agents by which a teaching be infallibly taught _by the universal magisterium of the bishops around the world_. If they can do it SOME of the time, then they **have** the role. And they all have the authority.      Now, there are indeed different _degrees_ by which those teachings enjoy the protection of the Holy Spirit. THAT's open to ""full"" versus something lesser. A pope has a heavier hand in that _being protected_ than other bishops, but his participation in the magisterial office isn't _utterly_ unlike that of the other bishops. He can still err (as proven), and (more importantly) _just like the other bishops_ his teachings are capable of DIFFERENT DEGREES of commanding that respect that comes under ""religious assent"" from the people of the Church. A pope, just like other bishops, teaches some things mildly, some things firmly, and some things _very_ firmly, without invoking the infallibility of an ex cathedra declaration. Similarly, popes (and other bishops) teach some things _in identical fashion_ as those before him for many centuries had, for some things, while on other things he sets out with a new metaphor, or a new explanation for an old doctrine, and _all the degrees in between_ that carry all the possible degrees of assertiveness.      AND THEY DON'T SIT THERE TELLING US WHERE EACH STATEMENT LANDS on these scales of firmness, traditionalness, etc. Indeed, if anything, the popes and bishops are _highly_ reticent to STATE EXPLICITLY anything about how firmly our obligation of religious assent kicks in for most of the things they say. We are left discerning that by _various markers_ that are available, including tradition, tone of 'voice', type of teaching occasion or document, etc. But (short of a solemn declaration by an ecumenical council) these markers make such discernment a chore and often only _probable_. Such, I think, is the life of the educated Catholic.      I would propose that the only teaching stuff that comes from the bishops that is ""not magisterial"" is the stuff that they themselves SAY is uncertain, putting in qualifiers like ""I feel that this is right, but I don't insist upon it"" and ""there is room for disagreement on this"" and so on. Everything else is ""teachings"" and therefore is magisterial.

3187,"I once had reason to write to my bishop about a matter of faith that needed clarification. His private, written response, delivered through his staff theologian, constituted _for me_ an expression of his will to teach me in a certain way, and his will that I accept his teaching. That it was a private letter indicated _how broadly_ he intended his instruction to bind people, but it did not detract from _whether_ he intended that I give his instruction my assent.

2779,"Dear @Michael and @Talmid      The point Michael made about sane mind is true. Because when you read all that deplorable doctrines (I am using doctrines for the other philosophical views like reductionism, buddhism, etc.) there's no way your mind not being affected. Not because they are too counterintuitive - even though that is true - but because of the derailment of reason and the bizarre (to say the least) conclusions.      When I found Ed's blog and learned a little bit more about act and potency (keep in mind that we don't have that in Brazil, at least I never found it anywhere through my youth or academic life) there is a certain beauty in the doctrine of Aristotle - not in the sense of ""wow, after all that bullsh*t I found across the internet like reductionism and etc. there is finally something sane"" - but most especially in the way that the doctrine fits with itself i.e in the way that is constructed (the careful appreciation of every matter and etc.). But most importantly that gave me hope. And that is something I can't forget. Because at least it seemed plausible at the time.      But I want to confess something. Even though I never was an atheist throughout my life, I never had strong reasons to believe in Our Father. That's no surprise that I became a skeptical pseudo-atheist through my 19's. In a sense, I think my skepticism is a disease that I can't get rid of and that grow to the point that made my life in the miserable condition that I am now. That's hard to say but I swear to God that that's true.      The one (and the only one to be honest) reason for all of that is the fact that I am afraid of believing some falsity and dying without knowing the truth. I know that sounds really dumb for a motive but on closer analysis, I'm pretty sure that 99% of atheists and co. minds work like that too. That's why I am that way. The origin of that was the fact that part of my family is ''Espirita'' (if you guys don't have that crap religion there is a mixture of cartesian res cogitans plus the movie ghost from Patrick Swayze) and for a long time I was surrounded by 'palatable' ideas like: ""after death, there is a soul in the same form as your body that will come out of it and live forever"".

Remember that later pagans and ancient and medieval christians took effort to argue against the gnostic view that the material world is bad because of the inevitable corruption and decay its existence creates, which seems alive on today antinatalists, so the view i'am defending does argue that even beings that can and do suffer and die are good. The realism on universals, evil as privation and ""being = goodness"" aspects are essencial to this to work, so i'am not suprised that you are not convinced.

3086,"Suck up all the words you want, when you can, while you can, Tom Cohoe. Because, as history is demonstrably informing us the hegemony of Catholic thought will continue to downsize in the public square due to its ever- decreasing significance and relevance in addressing the existential challenges in contemporary society. People are shedding the skin of catholic thought, not because it is wrong, but because it does not represent a comprehensive, let alone a universally acknowledged course in navigating the complex nature of modern life and its eclectic demands. It's a wishful throw-back to the 'good- old' days, to simpler times.      All of Feser's bogeymen, the most feared catholic demons are there: Marxism, postmodernism, liberation theology, and CRT. And Feser's manufactured rendition of CRT is intellectually and philosophically mistaken. Just as the extremely lucky that have had the good fortune of overcoming the psychological ravages and effects of Stockholm syndrome can attest, how easy it is for Catholics on this site to play the 'victimhood' card, that white people are being. ""... suckered into a spiral of endless self-abasement"". While-ever proponents such as Dr Feser deliberately choose to link Catholic thought as synonymous to the wholesale debasement of CRT going forward, my work is easy. I have no need to effect anything that isn't already the ineluctable result of the shrivelling of catholic thought. The seeds of its own destruction are deeply embedded within its own character.   It is egregiously misplaced for Dr Feser to argue from a perspective that is entirely unfounded. CRT does not, I repeat, does not teach that any race is inherently racist or superior, but it does teach how race is deeply ingrained in our history. The dozen or so States that have legislated against the 'teaching of CRT' in schools, banning books and curricular material across the country is the stuff of authoritarianism, not of democracies. It is nothing less than a cynical and forlorn attempt not only at erasing a somewhat sorry chapter in human relations but equally, the wholesale whitewashing of American history.   Nothing good will come of Dr Feser's approach. An entrenched position does not a discourse make.

3046,"Regarding your suggestion that it is up to me why I should hold a position that is contrary to the state of our society and that this is ""up to me"": Well this is true, but profoundly unhelpful for our discussion. It is ""up to you"" whether you believe in fairies and goblins. You are ""free"" to believe in fairies and goblins, but that does not make such a belief rooted in Scripture or Tradition. Nor does it make it reasonable. And choices that are rooted neither in reason nor revelation are baseless. Such ""freedom"" is really no freedom at all. It is a sheer willfulness to believe whatever I want to believe regardless of reason, evidence, and revelation. That is the point. Authentic freedom is always rooted in reason and/or revelation. In other words, authentic freedom is always rooted in the truth. If I have neither reason nor revelation to support my belief in fairies, then it is unreasonable to do so. If you wish to believe in fairies because they give you warm fuzzy feelings, you are ""free"" to do so, but that does not make your choice a good choice. It makes it baseless just as your choice to believe that everyone may be going to heaven is baseless.      This leads to the biggest problem with the position: counterfactuals. As Edward Feser has noted, it is part of the Tradition that rational beings are in hell, namely Satan and His Angels. It is also clear from Scripture that the way is narrow and few will find it. Now some passages of Scripture are difficult to interpret and admit varying interpretations. However, if one's ""interpretation"" involves denying or ignoring the testimony of Scripture, then this is not really an interpreation so much as a denial of the explicit teaching of Sripture. So if Scripture teaches that the way to eternal life is narrow and few will find it and I say it is broad and everyone will (or might find), then I am denying revelation. Who will or will not be saved is not something you or I could know apart from revelation. However, it is something that God knows and He has revealed to us that ""few will find it"". It is more than mental gymnastics to interpret this as ""everyone will find it"", it is a denial of the words of Christ who is in a better position than you or I to tell us whether the road is broad or narrow and whether few or many will find it.",regarding suggestion hold position contrary state society well true profoundly unhelpful discussion whether believe fairy goblin free believe fairy goblin make belief rooted scripture tradition make reasonable choice rooted neither reason revelation baseless freedom really freedom sheer willfulness believe whatever want believe regardless reason evidence revelation point authentic freedom always rooted reason andor revelation word authentic freedom always rooted truth neither reason revelation support belief fairy unreasonable wish believe fairy give warm fuzzy feeling free make choice good choice make baseless choice believe everyone may going heaven baseless lead biggest problem position counterfactuals edward feser noted part tradition rational being hell namely satan angel also clear scripture way narrow find passage scripture difficult interpret admit varying interpretation however interpretation involves denying ignoring testimony scripture really interpreation much denial explicit teaching sripture scripture teach way eternal life narrow find say broad everyone might find denying revelation saved something could know apart revelation however something god know revealed u find mental gymnastics interpret everyone find denial word christ better position tell u whether road broad narrow whether many find,feser,2318,0

The converse is true with the writings of those who haven't the slightest grip on reality (including Buddhists). One of Kant's friends had to stop reading his work because he felt he was going crazy. If the philosophy makes a person less sane, this is a good cue that it is neither good nor true. I hope to say more about this when there is time.

1881,"(continued from previous post)      So, in the case of Honorius, we see this distinction between formal and material heresy is not made, and the question of whether it could have been formally heretical is challenged by the fact that in his own lifetime (at least while holding the Chair), Honorius himself would have been the final court of appeal. Assuredly he would not have taken his own view to be heretical. So right there there seems to be a strong reason to declare he was at least not a FORMAL heretic. But this takes us to the question of the authority of FUTURE councils and Popes. Many questions arise.      First, it seems to me that while current popes have primacy of jurisdiction, and infallibility in ex cathedra teaching, their juridical judgments are not infallible (leaving aside the issue of the infallibility of canonizations of saints). But of course, in their time no one would have the authority to ignore or override a Pope's juridical judgment. Vatican I makes this much clear. BUT, could such a person still believe, privately or publicly, that a current pope's judgment was wrong, even while admitting that neither he (that person himself) nor anyone other than the Pope could juridically do anything about this? It seems this would be the case, though it would also be within the Pope's power to discipline such a person.      So, it does seem possible that a Pope could wrongly judge that someone was not in heresy, or that the person was heretical, but juridically that judgment would still have to be honored, since the current Pope would have the final say in such matters.

2591,"@Infinite Growth, there's that ignorant and vicious trope again. I'll bite, though this is a digression as my point was to show that even much more tangible claims toward restitution remain unaddressed if we wish to talk restitution.      Were there Poles who committed crimes during WWII, who went along with Nazi, or Soviet, crimes? Obviously. I feel silly even having to state the obvious because this is something that follows not from empirical fact, but from the general proposition that the moral status of the actions of individuals during wartime does not conform strictly to the divide of the front line. There were righteous Germans and righteous Russians and wicked Poles. So what? Judas betrayed Christ, but the Apostles on the whole or as a corporate body were not agents of the Sanhedrin. We can say the same about Jews who betrayed both their fellow Jews and committed crimes against gentile Poles, but we rarely talk about those, so why the special pleading here?      As a matter of empirical fact, we must remember things like:      1\. The Polish state never collaborated with the Nazis. Compare that with other European governments. This refusal to collaborate, and the formation of Europe's largest resistance, happened at enormous cost. This, in addition to Nazi crimes against the populace.   2\. Even the number of only those Poles recognized by Yad Vashem outstrips the combined number of people recognized from all other nations combined. Proportion and scale matter.   3\. The penalties for aiding Jews were uniquely and incomparably severe in Poland (involving the execution of the person aiding, his family, maybe neighbors, etc). And yet, point (2).   4\. Poland was home to something like 80% of world Jewry at the time of the war and the majority of the world's Jews for centuries. Any occurrence of antipathy (and don't forget Jewish bigotry, which did exist) at the time of the war was driven by economic, but also cultural, political, social, and historical factors, not racial hatred. That is, there was no impulse to exterminate any group and any crimes committed were isolated incidents of criminal opportunism taken during the chaos of wartime, not systematic programs of liquidation or some broad expression of national hatred. There were also incidents where Poles were forced under threat of death to participate in Nazi operations, incidents that some Jewish authors have grotesquely misrepresented either maliciously or through incompetence (e.g., Jan Gross).

Because for materialists in the technical sense - if they are to be coherent at all - they should say that people do not exist. But in the buddhist sense, not only people do not exist and there is just suffering but the world is always trying to deceive you. I don't need to canvas it more for you to see how much worse it is. There is simply no happiness at all and no one to see any good of it. It seems that ideology takes all of the best in the world and turn it into misery.

They say that causality is in some sense mind only or something we 'associate' but it's in some sense not really there (I think that's somehow related to why they are nominalists too). If this is coherent at the end of the day (I think that it's not) is another story - and that's what I want to know because something as evil as that CAN'T BE REAL.      During these years I tried to formulate ways in showing how that can't be true - I will put them in the other post. But man the problem is even if I somehow 'showed' that, I can't prove it to myself.

1833,"‘It is very common, doubtless, especially in religious controversy, to confuse infallibility with certitude, and to argue that, since we have not the one, we have not the other, for that no one can claim to be certain on any point, who is not infallible about all; but the two words stand for things quite distinct from each other. For example, I remember for certain what I did yesterday, but still my memory is not infallible; I am quite clear that two and two makes four, but I often make mistakes in long addition sums. I have no doubt whatever that John or Richard is my true friend, but I have before now trusted those who failed me, and I may do so again before I die.’      ‘A certitude is directed to this or that particular proposition; it is not a faculty or gift, but a disposition of mind relatively to a definite case which is before me. Infallibility, on the contrary, is just that which certitude is not; it is a faculty or gift, and relates, not to some one truth in particular, but to all possible propositions in a given subject-matter. We ought in strict propriety, to speak, not of infallible acts, but of acts of infallibility…’      ‘A man is infallible, whose words are always true; a rule is infallible, if it is unerring in all its possible applications. An infallible authority is certain in every particular case that may arise; but a man who is certain in some one definite case, is not on that account infallible.’      ‘I am quite certain that Victoria is our Sovereign, and not her father, the late Duke of Kent, without laying any claim to the gift of infallibility; as I may do a virtuous action, without being impeccable. I may be certain that the Church is infallible, while I am myself a fallible mortal; otherwise, I cannot be certain that the Supreme Being is infallible, until I am infallible myself. It is a strange objection, then, which is sometimes urged against Catholics, that they cannot prove and assent to the Church's infallibility, unless they first believe in their own. Certitude, as I have said, is directed to one or other definite concrete proposition. I am certain of proposition one, two, three, four, or five, one by one, each by itself. I may be certain of one of them, without being certain of the rest; that I am certain of the first makes it neither likely nor unlikely that I am certain of the second; but were I infallible, then I should be certain, not only of one of them, but of all, and of many more besides, which have never come before me as yet. Therefore we may be certain of the infallibility of the Church, while we admit that in many things we are not, and cannot be, certain at all.’      St John Henry Newman, ‘A Grammar of Assent’ pp. 173-74  ",‘ common doubtless especially religious controversy confuse infallibility certitude argue since one one claim certain point infallible two word stand thing quite distinct example remember certain yesterday still memory infallible quite clear two two make four often make mistake long addition sum doubt whatever john richard true friend trusted failed may die ‘ certitude directed particular proposition faculty gift disposition mind relatively definite case infallibility contrary certitude faculty gift relates one truth particular possible proposition given subject-matter ought strict propriety speak infallible act act infallibility… ‘ man infallible whose word always true rule infallible unerring possible application infallible authority certain every particular case may arise man certain one definite case account infallible ‘ quite certain victoria sovereign father late duke kent without laying claim gift infallibility may virtuous action without impeccable may certain church infallible fallible mortal otherwise certain supreme infallible infallible strange objection sometimes urged catholic prove assent infallibility unless first believe certitude said directed one definite concrete proposition certain proposition one two three four five one one may certain one without certain rest certain first make neither likely unlikely certain second infallible certain one many besides never come yet therefore may certain infallibility church admit many thing certain st john henry newman ‘ grammar pp -,feser,2722,0

Leaving out the disputed phrase this becomes, ""Does not this indeterminacy mean that it can never be settled?""      Replacing the disputed phrase, with a single word object for the preposition, this becomes, ""Does not this indeterminacy WITHIN SOME mean that it can never be settled?""      SOME = ""We who have not yet suffered death""      This is a noun clause. It is the object of the preposition ""within"". It is a dependent clause and must exist in some relation with the rest of the sentence. It cannot stand alone as an independent sentence. The preposition ""within"" connects this dependent clause with the sentence. The entire clause is the object of the preposition. Otherwise the rest of the clause, ""who have not yet suffered death"", would be standing alone with no connection to the sentence.      Let us look at the clause in isolation by making it independent.      ""We, who have not yet suffered death, pause.""      ""Us, who have not yet suffered death, pause""      You choose.

278,"1) You can indeed seek something for its own sake while also seeking it for the sake of something else, but that implies there are two motives properly distinct from the other; and one could then perhaps say that what defines the motive of seeking something for its own sake is to not seek it for the sake of something else AND to seek it for the intrinsic value it has. This motive, having such a structure, would still be properly distinct from the other motive which DOES seek something for the sake of something else.      2) So about seeking a thing of intrinsic value instrumentally, I think this just reifies (or is that the wrong word to use?) or reduces the intrinic value of a thing to just a means - you could literally just replace it and have the rich man tell you he's gonna give you much money if you find something completely red today.      The redness in this case, just like the intrinsic value in the other, is just an identifier that you're looking for in order to gain something else. So I think there's a confusion of meaning going on when someone says they pursue X because of the intrinsic value it has. One could take this in an instrumental sense, or one could instead take this in a sense similar to how one loves others for their own sake, or oneself for one's own sake.      When one seeks the good of another person for the other's own sake, I guess one is thereby recognising the intrinsic axiology or value-ness of the person and doing the action on the basis of that.      One sees the value of the other and recognises that benefitting the other person itself, taking the person as the end because they're valuable simply as such (axiologically I guess?) is good. So benefitting them is just intrinsically worth seeking of itself, with the end being the person, and the grounds being the value & worth of the person properly distinct from any other end.         3) As for achieving X for the sake of Y, I think the person doing the achieving is also crucial. For the person wanting to achieve X for the sake of Y, Y is the final cause of **their achieving** X, not X by itself simpliciter.      So it seems one could say that, for the person wanting to achieve X, if he wanted to do this for its own sake, he'd be taking X as the final cause of the very achieving itself, or the seekig to achieve. There's no problem in taking X as the final cause of itself then, since it's not about a final cause inhering in X itself.         4) I'd also love to know the difference between seeking X for X's sake and seeking it for its own sake, because those two seem identical to me - what is ""its own sake"" in regards to X? How could it not be, well.....X itself? Since the ""own"" is self-referential to X?

They do not think, so their thinking cannot be confused.      Humans tricked into believing false things are tricked through their intellects. Human behavior is controlled, one way or another, by what we arrive at through thinking and what we think can be confused and incorrect, especially when others are trying to confuse for their own purposes. A person given a false argument that convinces him that he can drive up a ramp at a certain speed and leap his car over a big rock might try it and consequently hurt himself based on the false idea that the argument was correct, and this would be a mistake or confusion of his intellect, not of his feelings.

757," _It's hard for me to even understand why you would want to make such a distinction except unless you were motivated by the desire to deny the force of arguments for the existence of God._      The motivation stems from Kant's attempt to respond to Humean skepticism. Kant thinks metaphysical principles (e.g. every event must have a cause) can only be justified in virtue of their expressing conditions of the possibility of experience, viz. the conditions objects must satisfy in order to be objects of experience _for us_. But this suggests the need to distinguish between two says of considering objects, namely in relation to subjects with our forms of cognition (things as they appear to us) and independently of such relations (things as they are in themselves).

2414,"Dr. Feser, thank you for a solid post on suffering.      A few of the comments above have brought up the problem of ""animal pain."" While I understand the standard response to that to be something along the lines of ""necessity justified in view of the perfection of creation,"" I'm wondering if there is not a richer answer hidden in the back of our tradition. Specificly, I'm wondering about the role of angels in all this.      Think of something like Tolkien's cosmology - physical evil and disorder entered into creation when the principalities and powers of the world (The Valar and Maiar) entered into conflict with each other, one desiring to fullfill the creators plan to make a habitation for the ""children of illuvitar"" (rational life), and others, out to make a dominion for themselves. As proper ""sub-creators,"" God, in his secondary causality, had given spiritual beings the duties of care and creation in the physical world, and the flaws, imperfections, and downright violence of creation were due to the infidelity of some of the powers intrusted to their care. If we hold the standard line that fallen angels fell in the first instant of their creation, and, further, that they had been, nevertheless, been given dominion over certain parts or aspects of creation, then Johanine language about the ""lord of this world,"" and Pauline language about the ""princes of the powers of the air,"" makes a lot more sense, and can even be joined to an evolutionary cosmology.      The universe is an odd place, and the creation of the conditions for life, let alone rational life, in an odd, (physically fallen?) cosmos could be seen as the fruit of angelic conquest over malign forces. Furthermore, evolution itself might be seen as being helped along or guided by forces trying to bring about God's will in creation.

550,"@Talmid: My condition for the “necessary” is ‘in order to achieve God’s plan’. We can of course only see that very dimly indeed, but it’s clear that the “new heaven and earth” will be more like the creation that people who reject God because of theodicy issues would expect of a good God. No more working in vain, no more pain of witnessing your children's misfortune. The wolf and the lamb eat together, even the lion no longer eats other creatures. So it seems clear to me from revelation that these things are a necessary phase of creation. When God creates he says it’s “good”, even though He knew it would contain elements that would not be part of the second creation. Once we were consciously able to choose between Him and not-Him, we often chose the latter. However it’s in making this choice correctly when it’s not obvious or easy that we ‘grow up’, as in we become as our Father intended.      Now I agree with you that we can imagine universes where we would be free and where we could easily see what is right, where there is no suffering of us or others to make us ‘loose heart’, and where there are no bright and shiny false lights with temporary excitement and pleasure. However, like the vines planted in good, loamy soil, which produce great big bunches of grapes but poor wine, there is clearly a need for us to struggle a bit in an apparently sub optimal environment for the creation process to have a successful end point. How God knows that, we cannot know. Did He tune creation like a quantum experiment, with all possible realities happening, and from eternity selected the one that worked best? Or did He just know, because He is infinite and absolute in all things? I suspect the latter, but the point is that we see a very small part of the creation process. The people who have the most issue with it nearly always think the process is complete, and that is their downfall.",talmid condition “ necessary ” ‘ order achieve course see dimly indeed clear “ new heaven earth ” like creation people reject god theodicy issue would expect good god working vain pain witnessing misfortune wolf lamb eat together even lion longer eats creature seems clear revelation thing necessary phase creation god creates say “ good ” even though knew would contain element would part second creation consciously able choose not-him often chose latter however making choice correctly obvious easy ‘ grow become father intended agree imagine universe would free could easily see right suffering u others make u ‘ loose bright shiny false light temporary excitement pleasure however like vine planted good loamy soil produce great big bunch grape poor wine clearly need u struggle bit apparently sub optimal environment creation process successful end point god know know tune creation like quantum experiment possible reality happening eternity selected one worked best know infinite absolute thing suspect latter point see small part creation process people issue nearly always think process complete downfall,feser,1902,0

2927,"Vincent, I fear your new theory is just the same as the Aristotelian thesis but in different words. You still have levels of being and now some actualities are grounded in other “actualities.” Form is the source of a things defined properties, matter is the source of its ability to have other properties. If you scrap matter for just another kind of form then you have a Parmenedian static universe. If this conclusion doesn’t follow from your new conception of “levels of actuality” then you’re really just describing potency.      Potency is not mysterious, it’s almost the exact same meaning as when average men say something has “potential.” And I highly disagree that essence and existence are artificial.      The ancients like Plato and Aristotle were much better at being in touch with intuitive knowledge and deepening their understanding of what is already implicit in our mind (I.e. growing of wisdom) rather than the contemporary philosophical practice of over-analyzing to the point of doubting the obvious. The contemporary philosopher is rigorously trained to over-analyze and cut himself off from the original source of information (e.g.Descartes, Kant, pansyschism, etc.), so I caution against the accusation that Plato, Aristotle, or Aquinas were mysterious or artificial in their thinking when it is probably us who are blind.

3429,"@ Tadeo,      I cannot speak for Ed, but I was not arguing for or against natural selection per se. I disentangle truth and natural selection, as science, through my idea that, since a random sequence is a valid image of God, and since we know through quantum mechanics that there is such a thing as a random sequence, a random sequence, being without rules, is a very simple image of God, who also is without rules.      But God is greater than this or any other image, and is in no way limited by this image. So questions about consciousness do not restrict this image. What it is useful for, to we humans, is to show that we cannot calculate, with our mathematical science, what God's acts will be or are, since we cannot calculate a number (a sequence) whose digits are without a rule (are random), and, since God is truth, this separates truth from natural selection. In short, it is beyond our understanding (at least for me) to know whether natural selection is actual science, although as a theory of science, as Ed said in the video, (""natural selection favors fitness"") it explains adaption to the environment of survivors.      I can't see how your question can give a different answer without assumption, so I can't see it as a real question because the answer is either beyond our understanding, or follows from the arbitrary assumptions in its formulation. I suppose this is a parallel to Chomsky's claim that some questions are not real questions (but I am no fan of Chomsky).      My answer follows from my belief in God as truth.

2198,"@ Walter Van den Acker,      ""Please continu""      Well then, the simplicity of a random number is greater than the simplicity of science, logic, or mathematics. The XOR process is meant to show that even a finite random sequence can mean any predetermined thing, but we cannot unravel its intended meaning, except by luck, and even then, there is no way to know that the lucky guess was correct, because it could mean anything that would fit against its length, as I wrote earlier.      The logic that you and I use, as expressed by Aristotle, is complex. The rules of inference are ordered and detailed in a complex way that cannot be reduced to the simplicity of a random number, which yet contains them if it is long enough, as I described. I earlier described how 2+2 could easily be made equal to 3 as shown by video games running a sequence that displays such things on a screen (ask me if this was somewhere else that I discussed it). With the infinite random sequence, an image (only) of God, these things are written an infinite number of times. Any finite part of it that is long enough, running on a computer, could always show our logic expressed as we know it. It could also always show the rules incorrectly expressed. That is because the predetermined meaning that could be anything intended, in the image, is not open to us and the XOR process shows that no specific random sequence matters. It's all in there somewhere and the computer can show anything you can imagine (now I will include moving images). It could show that the world runs exactly as our sight and sound senses tell us it runs except that if you walk 500 steps without stopping you step on the tines of a rake that suddenly appears and it pops up and gives you a good whack on the head and then disappears. Yet for some reason, people mentally (only) start to count their steps, they do not know why they are doing it, and they forget where they are in their count long before they reach 500. Then after 500 - whack!      Logic in this computable world would have to be different from the logic we love and know in order to account for these abnormal (in our world) mental phenomena. God knows this idea, but is not limited by it. If you don't like it, you can always ignore this computable meaning and only pay attention to the one you like. It's in there too but so are great numbers of other computable meanings.      Something that suggests this is the arrangement of the grains of sand on a beach washed by winds, waves, and disturbed by animals, including humans with their various activities, motorised or not, disturbed by their nuclear activity, etc. Now look at the arrangement of the grains as they change for a few days and then try to articulate something in the spirit of science as we know it that will allow you to accurately predict the arrangement of the grains into the future.

2258,"1- I don't care about what is taught by the Church, so I'll ignore that;      2- I also don't care about what Scripture teaches;      3- Aren't you getting Essence and Existence confused with Form and Matter? Knowing whether a Tasmanian tiger exists or not is a matter of knowing whether it has Existence or not, not what its Matter is. Sure, the existence of an animal might require its material exemplification, but this is not the case with immaterial beings (such as souls, angels, God, or any other candidates). What you are pointing to is precisely the difference between Essence and Existence - that you can know what-a-thing-is without knowing that-a-thing-is. It's not the same as what form a thing has versus its material cause (which also could or could not exist). I don't know what you mean by ""Pure Existence"" being vague or not infinite but Aquinas has some pretty good arguments for why Pure Existence is infinite, divine, etc.      More importantly, why are you ignoring the entire rationale for Divine Simplicity? It seems to be a recurring thing among critics. You point apparent problems but then ignore the arguments given for simplicity.      I speak as a person who has no ulterior motives; I simply am convinced that the First Cause of all things must be absolutely simple. If it had parts, then it would be dependent upon those parts for its existence, and thus would not be perfectly independent. Yet cosmological arguments require a foundation that is entirely independent of anything, which just is necessary existence, unconditioned. A composite is always conditioned by its parts, its existence is always ""iffy"" and dependent on the parts. So if ""God"" had parts, the parts would be the First Principles, not the composite. And if you follow that along, you'll reach some really bad problems.   And if God had an accident distinct of himself (his essence), where would this accident come from? It can't come from the essence lest you accept the precedence of a perfectly simple Essence which is the source of all things, which is what you're trying to avoid. But there is nowhere for the accident to come from, then, and being an accident, it cannot exist ""by its own (non- substantial, hence conditioned and dependent) nature"". You know classical authors reflected a lot on these matters and didn't just adopt Divine Simplicity because of church teaching, right?      4- And yet the same happens with libertarian freedom for us as well. Before you make your choice, there is a point in which there is no difference in your properties between world 1 (where you go on to choose X) and world 2 (where you go on to not choose X). So do you reject libertarian free will for humans too? Since I accept LFW, I already cannot accept that objection.      If I had to accept it, though, I would rather embrace necessitarian emanationism or optimism etc. than reject Simplicity, speaking for myself.      5- This objection wouldn't just cut against Divine Simplicity; it would also cut against creation being the result of a free choice, given what I said in 4.

3137,"@Laudator Temporis Acti      That other fallible humans have a subjective certainty Y, that contradicts a subjective certainty X belonging to my own fallible self, is no proof that X could not be recognised by me as objectively valid. (As with the colour of Fluffy the cat in my previous post) it's only a problem if all I knew about X and Y were that they were beliefs belonging to this or that person.      If all the knowledge that we had access to was that 'I believe X, you believe Y', then since we are all fallible, there would be no grounds for preferring X over Y in regard to their objective certainty.      But the presupposition that all the knowledge to which we have access is of the form 'I believe X, you believe Y', is a type of philosophical idealism: 'All we can directly know is the fact that something is someone's belief - we cannot have direct knowledge of evidence for these beliefs in themselves, whereby we can discriminate which are true and which are false.'      But we do not grant this unproven idealist presupposition (which furthermore is contradicted by our very experience of having direct awareness of evidence); and so we are not led to the relativist conclusion.      In short, we are not reduced to saying, 'Fallible person A says X, fallible person B says Y - who knows?' Each fallible individual can turn to the actual evidence, by which valid objective certainties can be established in particular cases - even if in other particular cases, someone (myself or others) fails to properly examine the evidence, and so actualizes in those particular cases the abstract possibility of falling into error.      I agree that my background and life history makes it more likely for me to have ended up a Catholic than e.g. a Hindu. But that proves nothing. My background also makes it more likely that I will have a valid objective certainty of Pythagoras' Theorem, than if I had been born in 3000 BC. For every individual, particular contingent circumstances channel us into a position where we are more favourably placed than we otherwise would have been to discover objective evidence for this or that truth. That does not invalidate our objective certainty of those truths, once we have seen the evidence. Again the principle: we must examine the actual evidence regarding X (not matters about our background that are logically irrelevant to the truth or falsity of X).      And just on a couple of your other points:      I can agree for the sake of argument that Newman's example regarding the trustworthiness of John or Richard is for our purposes the least satisfactory of his examples, since the nature of the 'evidence' for their trustworthiness raises all sorts of other questions. (His example is nonetheless perhaps a useful corrective against modelling our understanding of certainty primarily on our experience of mathematical certainty, rather than on e.g. certainties that occur in interpersonal relationships.)      And the passive infallibility (according to Catholic teaching) of the whole Body of the Faithful guided by the Holy Spirit, has no bearing on the topic of an admittedly fallible individual, Catholic or not, coming to a valid objective certainty in a particular case, by rationally examining evidence.

1040,"(Cont)      Of course, you can argue that the Christian God is evil either according to Christianity own view of goodness or a diferent view of goodness that is taken to be objective.      I'am taking care of arguing against the view that God can be seen as evil on the christian own standards but i admit that this is not much because you clearly take a diferent view on goodness, seeing your argumentation and being a vegetarian, so you could aways reply ""yea, this god is not evil if we accept a wrong definition of good"". I suppose that this is why you say that apologists are changing the definition if goodness.      On the christian view, God can be said to do good to us not only in giving us the chance of Heaven but even in creating we as imperfect as we are. Even existing badly is better that not existing for being is intrinsically good. Now, the zoo example and your vegetarianism* show that you disagree with this, i suppose that being is not good to you on every situation or case and, living on a world were suffering is so prevalescent, i can see were this come from, it is a judgment impossible to never make at least for a moment while living under the sun.      So i think that i see the source of the disagreement here: you and the christian tradition have diferent views on goodness that change the perception of this world and the judgment of Goodness Itself making it.

One question about killing the leader of an invading country is whether the leader counts as a civilian, since the killing of civilians is forbidden by the Geneva Convention. There is also some worry about the Geneva Convention's killing by ""perfidy"", which is taken to rule out at least some assassinations. So, as a matter of positive international law, it seems a difficult question.

In my post I assumed that killing the general would stop the invasion. I got to assume that because I was making up the case.

1297,"You want full message, fine here.   -I read your ""The experience of God"" book twice and I have some questions regarding it.   First is a minor nitpick (And I mean no offence for saying this) but I feel you have a tendency to use too many $10 words. Case in point; you use the word ""quotidian"" at least 5 times that I can remember, when that word is almost never better than its friendly companions ""daily"", ""everyday"", ""ordinary"", and ""commonplace"". Now having a large vocabulary isn't a bad thing, but a flagrant use of obscure words made it very difficult to understand your point.   My second problem is your concept of God and how you define it. Your definition of God is that in trying to elevate Him to the loftiest heights, heights truly befitting the magnificence of God, I feel you have reduced Him to empty concepts/platitudes, both completely meaningless and as uninspiring as mathematical axioms. What could it mean to say God is existence, or consciousness, or bliss, or any of the other abstract concepts that one often hears thrown about by other religious believers: love, truth, the alpha and the omega, and so on? One might as well argue that God is electricity, gravity, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Of course, this would be ludicrous. Who would seek ecstatic union with the weak nuclear force, or pray to electricity, or find solace in the presence of gravity? But slap a poetic, inspirational-sounding abstraction on God (being, truth, beauty, etc.), and suddenly the whole thing gains a veneer of credibility it hasn't earned.   The meaninglessness of your idea of God culminates in your assertion that God must be simple, unable to “possess distinct parts, or even distinct properties” (p.128), and, as eternal, He can’t be subject to change either (time being a measure of change – not to mention the fact that change indicates a movement from potentiality to actuality, whereas God is pure actuality (another meaningless concept)). What can possibly be left over after one has removed distinct parts/properties and the ability to change?   Lastly you defend all of this by claiming that any other way of thinking about God is guilty of anthropomorphism; the tendency to re-make God in our own image and likeness. The charge of anthropomorphism is undeniably valid when people try to convince us that a being even the tiniest bit like what you describe, God cares about what you do in the privacy of your own bedroom, or desires human worship, or takes sides favouring one equally petty, narrow- minded tribe over another, but it is far from obvious that the claim that God isn’t subject to change or lacks distinguishing properties fares any better. The problem here is to explain how this God can be as transcendent as you claim and yet not dissolve into meaningless abstractions. Unfortunately, to the extent that you attempt this impossible task, all you do is appeal to even more meaninglessness propositions. If God can’t change, He must therefore be unfeeling and unable to be aware of contingent truths, you argue?   Hart: It’s just that “his knowledge or bliss or love does not involve any metaphysical change in him” (p.137). God therefore can’t act in the world, nor can He be free, you say?   Hart: God’s “creative intention… can be understood as an eternal act that involves no temporal change within him. His freedom… [consists in] the infinite liberty with which he manifests himself in the creation he wills from everlasting.” (p.139)  ",want full message fine -i read experience god book twice question regarding first minor nitpick mean offence saying feel tendency use many word case point use word quotidian least time remember word almost never better friendly companion daily everyday ordinary commonplace large vocabulary bad thing flagrant use obscure word made difficult understand point second problem concept god define definition god trying elevate loftiest height height truly befitting magnificence god feel reduced empty conceptsplatitudes completely meaningless uninspiring mathematical axiom could mean say god existence consciousness bliss abstract concept one often hears thrown religious believer love truth alpha omega one might well argue god electricity gravity strong weak nuclear force course would ludicrous would seek ecstatic union weak nuclear force pray electricity find solace presence gravity slap poetic inspirational-sounding abstraction god truth beauty etc suddenly whole thing gain veneer credibility earned meaninglessness idea god culminates assertion god must simple unable “ posse distinct part even distinct property ” p eternal subject change either time measure change – mention fact change indicates movement potentiality actuality whereas god pure actuality another meaningless concept possibly left one removed distinct partsproperties ability change lastly defend claiming way thinking god guilty anthropomorphism tendency re-make god image likeness charge anthropomorphism undeniably valid people try convince u even tiniest bit like describe god care privacy bedroom desire human worship take side favouring one equally petty narrow- minded tribe another far obvious claim god subject change lack distinguishing property fare better problem explain god transcendent claim yet dissolve meaningless abstraction unfortunately extent attempt impossible task appeal even meaninglessness proposition god change must therefore unfeeling unable aware contingent truth argue hart “ knowledge bliss love involve metaphysical change ” p god therefore act world free say hart “ creative intention… understood eternal act involves temporal change within freedom… consists infinite liberty manifest creation will everlasting ” p,feser,3487,0
1457,"As Kurt suggests: it may indeed be possible to ""read"" Francis's words in a charitable light in which ""what he meant"" was to castigate the nasty proselytism that uses bad means (and motives) to push people into the Church, and not to throw stones at the kinder, gentler persuasion by which we justly bring others to appreciate the true Church of Christ. But at the same time, Francis used highly ambiguous phrasings to convey that, and - like he has ever so many other times - he INTENDS to be ambiguous, that's is precisely his operating method.      In this case, for example, there is, in addition to the negative-connotation word ""proselytism"" in the second sentence, the word ""convince"" in the first sentence. There is no reason, outside of Francis's choice to put them next to each other, to imagine that ""convincing someone of your faith"" amounts to ""proselytism"". Even if one might have (before this) thought he was **strictly** avoiding the impermissible ""proselytism"" types of action, and merely speaking so as to ""convince"" a listener of his faith, now he has to second-guess whether even that is allowable. And so, Francis chose to cloud up the matter.      It would be silly to look at all the hundreds (at this point) of occasions in which he has done this, and somehow imagine that they come out evenly divided between a traditional and a progressive view of Christianity. They do nothing of the sort: the confusion and obscurity sown is **very decidedly** in favor of one angle, and that's the progressive view. He's never accidentally confusing in a way that promotes traditional, standard Catholicism. So, it's not accidental at all, it's intentional.      (And by the way, in that video by Mike Lofton is FAR from being wholly exculpatory: take, for example, this quote from a 2007 doc. by BXVI's curia:      _The term proselytism originated in the context of Judaism, in which the term proselyte referred to someone who, coming from the gentiles, had passed into the Chosen People….More recently, however, the term has taken on a negative connotation, to mean the promotion of a religion by ujsing means, and for motives, contrary to the spirit of the Gospel that is, which do not safeguard the freedom and dignity of the person. It is in this sense that the term proselytism is understood in the context of the ecumenical movement: cf. The Joint Working Group between the Catholic Church and the World Council of Churches…”_      Sure, the World Council of Churches take the term ""proselytism"" that way, **precisely because many of them think evangelization is a sin**. And so the push on the idea of ""proselytism"" = bad, and try to eliminate the meaning of the term which was just fine until they came along. Trying to control the language to win the debate. And shame on the Vatican for accepting their improper constraint on the term. If you want to shame those who proselytize wrongly, SAY that ""they proselytize wrongly"".

When you need food, or there is a lion at the cave entrance, you don’t want to be thinking about ways to make clothes, how the sun moves through the sky etc. In the modern world the foundations of the wall tend to be physics, chemistry, maths, geology, economics, politics etc, which themselves have foundations built on a reduction to small things (pebbles). Once you believe in God, that is always the foundation stone. To me this is why literalist, fundamentalist protestants have such a problem with science, but that’s a different subject.

1923,"Well done. You, and I believe someone else, touch on another point I wanted to make but already had a four part reply. :) As you say, there had not yet at the time of Honorious been a formal declaration against monotheletism, so one could not be accused of knowingly opposing a formally established doctrine of the faith. At most, one could say he erred in failing to make an allegedly obvious deduction from Chalcedon (all arguable), but that it seems to me would still just rise to the level of material heresy, because presumably the failure to make such a deduction would not in itself evidence obstinancy in error. And, to be a formal error, there would have to be, I think, a formal declaration of what is to be believed. So I think we are back to (among other things) the question of whether it even makes sense to accuse a deceased person of formal heresy (which Feser has not done I realize), unless perhaps we can explicitly find a place where this person acknowledged he knew his view was heretical and did not care, etc.      It is also fair to say, I think, that these current insights would prevent such declarations against Honorius today. And we might have raise, as i have previously, where future popes could amend the non doctrinal juridical condemnations of earlier councils, but I would have to know more about the status of such statement relative to the establishment of tradition to venture a confident answer on that point. But I am inclined, very tentatively, to say since judgments are not infallible (even if they are at least authoritative AT THE TIME they are given) that they could be corrected later--though of course those corrections themselves could also be the same measure also be reviewed later, and so on.

1408,"George LeSauvage,      Nowhere in ""Natural Right and History"" does Strauss make an argument for ""a body of unchanging moral principles regarded as a basis for all human conduct."" We should dismiss the idea that the book is about what we would consider natural law. Nowhere does Strauss make an argument for individual rights generally, or any individual right specifically as we would understand those rights as listed the US Bill of Rights or our Declaration of Independence. He doesn't even argue that such a right exists in the most abstract sense. Even when Strauss mentions a document in what appears to be a favorable light, be careful to scrutinize what he really says about it. It's probably not what one thinks on first reading.      Strauss writes as he asks his students to read -- esoterically as well as exoterically. One must be very careful when one reads Strauss because he writes to intentionally pander to those who want to interpret his words in a superficial context. He does not want the unwashed masses to know what he really believes.      The question was about the meaning of ""natural right"" as used by Straussians -- how can it be more basic than natural law.

To make clear what I meant by recent politics, take, for example, Act H.R.1226 and Senate Act S.447 through which certain organizations, with the aid of the US government, are trying to extract massive sums of money from the Polish state for so-called heirless property that once belonged to Jews. According to both Polish law and the general legal principle followed virtually everywhere, property without a legal heir reverts to the state after the death of its owner. If a legal heir exists, he is free to pursue restitution like everyone else through the Polish courts. The absurd position of certain groups is that the Polish government should treat these cases in a extraordinary way and offer broad restitution anyway, not to any heirs, because of course they don't exist, but to organizations and people who are not legal heirs. And recall that this was property held by Polish citizens as Polish Jews were Polish citizens. By reinforcing the notion that Poles, as a corporate body, are guilty of collaborating in the criminal program of the Nazis, it becomes easier to make claims on the Polish state. Heirless property, combined with a sprinkle of customary special pleading, misrepresentation, and the thought- diffusing VIP pass that is the word ""Holocaust"", provides a convenient opportunity for unscrupulous organizations to illegitimately extract billions of dollars from the Polish state by exploiting the emotional force of a historical tragedy. Perhaps such organizations should instead direct their claims to Berlin as the German state is responsible for handling the restitution of Jewish property lost through actions of the Nazi regime.

372,"The contribution story does seem intuitively correct, and I think we can make sense of the fact that two just punishments combine into an unjust punishment. If Alice deserves a punishment to degree d, then it seems Alice must have done something which harmed someone else proportionally to degree d. This is because the degree of punishment deserved must be proportional to the degree of harm done. Thus, if both Bob and Carl simultaneously impose punishments of degree d on Alice, then each has imposed punishments that are separately proportional to the harm done, but are jointly disproportional to the harm done. It is this disproportionality that renders the joint punishment unjust.      I wonder if this suggests that punishment can only properly come from one source (where this source may be either one individual or a collective)? Consider the following equivalent, but slightly more specified case. A teenager breaks into a church donation box and steals the money inside. Upon finding out about this theft, the teen's parents separately and unbeknownst to the other donates money to the church from the teen's bank account equal to the amount stolen plus some amount X that fulfills the requirements of punishment (e.g. covering secondary harms like the broken offering box and serving as a deterrent for future theft). Similar to the previous case, each punishment is proportional to the harm done and therefore just. Additionally, these punishments are jointly unjust as, combined, they are clearly disproportional to the harm done.      Notice in this case it seems the problem is that the parents did not act as one unit. They independently imposed two punishments for one bad act. These punishments combine to one joint punishment that is issued from the collective parents. So while individually neither parent gave an unjust punishment, they failed as members of the actual punishing entity to properly coordinate and issue just punishment.      It's also interesting to consider an opposite case. Start with the previous case, only this time each parent independently impose punishments that are half of what is deserved. In this case, each punishment is individually less than what justice calls for (and is thus unjust to the victims), but they are jointly just. As such, the parents jointly and accidentally punished their child justly. However, it seems neither is praiseworthy because they individually issued unjust punishments.",contribution story seem intuitively correct think make sense fact two punishment combine unjust punishment alice deserves punishment degree seems alice must done something harmed someone else proportionally degree degree punishment deserved must proportional degree harm done thus bob carl simultaneously impose punishment degree alice imposed punishment separately proportional harm done jointly disproportional harm done disproportionality render joint punishment unjust wonder suggests punishment properly come one source source may either one individual collective consider following equivalent slightly specified case teenager break church donation box steal money inside upon finding theft parent separately unbeknownst donates money church bank account equal amount stolen plus amount x fulfills requirement punishment eg covering secondary harm like broken offering box serving deterrent future theft similar previous case punishment proportional harm done therefore additionally punishment jointly unjust combined clearly disproportional harm done notice case seems problem parent act one unit independently imposed two punishment one bad act punishment combine one joint punishment issued collective parent individually neither parent gave unjust punishment failed member actual punishing entity properly coordinate issue punishment also interesting consider opposite case start previous case time parent independently impose punishment half deserved case punishment individually le justice call thus unjust victim jointly parent jointly accidentally punished child justly however seems neither praiseworthy individually issued unjust punishment,pruss,2454,1

36,"I've wondered about such incompossible goods myself. Weightlifting can reduce agility, for example, and while being tall is great for basketball, it is not good for weightlifting. Various niches seem to exist. It does raise the question of what a perfect human being consists of, however. Are some of these ""perfections"" merely accidental in the sense that they exploit what are normatively speaking (in relation to human nature) flaws? We know some sports are actually bad for the human body, or neglect the overall health of the body. Certain perfections seem to be perfections only in an analogical sense, perhaps something along the lines of being a ""good thief"" or an ""effective deceiver"".      Where intelligence is concerned, I am tempted to argue against incompossible goods either because intelligence isn't like that or for similar natural law reasons, but even more strongly, especially on account of the centrality of intelligence to humanity.      Consider your favorite déformation professionnelle, which, I submit, is more of a result of imprudence, habit, ignorance, lack of practice using other methods, and even effeminacy and arrogance. Someone with a rigorous philosophical education is less likely to try to pigeonhole reality into the reductive and simplified straitjacket of our physical models in the manner of at least some physicists who generally lack serious exposure to philosophy and may even hold it in contempt out of ignorance. A physicist may also be tempted to pigeonhole simply because of pride; if he isn't any good at metaphysics, then his thoughts on a metaphysical subject matter aren't likely to be very valuable or interesting, and that stings the prideful man accustomed to feeling like a hotshot. There is also the threat of seeing one's own field put in its methodological place, so to speak, deflating any pretensions to the kind of ultimacy that metaphysics lays claim to. A competent physics may also derive greater pleasure from exercising his specialized competence and choose his methods simply on the basis of what feels good and now what is called for by a problem. So here the question resurfaces: is there an incompossibility between being a good physicist and a good metaphysician? I suspect there isn't intrinsically, even if that is often the case which I suspect is rather a result of how one's time is spent. But even if it is the case, because general knowledge is superior and more worthy of human attention than specialized knowledge, we could argue that competence in physics that occurs at the expense of philosophical depth is, in fact, a kind of failure to attain human excellence by failing to devote proportional attention and effort to the kinds of knowledge that are most essential, and in doing so, risking intellectual deformation in important and even necessary matters.",ive wondered incompossible good weightlifting reduce agility example tall great basketball good weightlifting various niche seem exist raise question perfect human consists however perfection merely accidental sense exploit normatively speaking relation human nature flaw know sport actually bad human body neglect overall health body certain perfection seem perfection analogical sense perhaps something along line good thief effective deceiver intelligence concerned tempted argue incompossible good either intelligence like similar natural law reason even strongly especially account centrality intelligence humanity consider favorite déformation professionnelle submit result imprudence habit ignorance lack practice using method even effeminacy arrogance someone rigorous philosophical education le likely try pigeonhole reality reductive simplified straitjacket physical model manner least physicist generally lack serious exposure philosophy may even hold contempt ignorance physicist may also tempted pigeonhole simply pride good metaphysics thought metaphysical subject matter likely valuable interesting sting prideful man accustomed feeling like hotshot also threat seeing field put methodological place speak deflating pretension kind ultimacy metaphysics lay claim competent physic may also derive greater pleasure exercising specialized competence choose method simply basis feel good called problem question resurfaces incompossibility good physicist good metaphysician suspect intrinsically even often case suspect rather result time spent even case general knowledge superior worthy human attention specialized knowledge could argue competence physic occurs expense philosophical depth fact kind failure attain human excellence failing devote proportional attention effort kind knowledge essential risking intellectual deformation important even necessary matter,pruss,2844,1
2031,"@Miguel      It might be framed this way: Under what conditions do we ""instruct the ignorant"" and under what conditions to we ""rebuke the sinner"".

We do the former when dealing with someone who is ignorant (but not malicious) and that latter when someone is a sinner (i.e. malicious but not ignorant; they know it is wrong and don't really care). This entails that we are able to recognize and distinguish malice and ignorance. I think learning to do this effectively is critical for being able to effectively win people to the truth. If you rebuke a sincerely mistaken person for their mistake, this is unnecessary. Such a person just needs instruction. If you give instruction to a malicious person, this is uneffective because they don't care at all about the truth. Such a person doesn't need to be taught, he needs to be rebuked.

You neither have disputed any of my arguments nor presented any ""alternative"" to anything whatsoever, so I do not know what you mean here. To recap: Satan rebelled, the fall happened. Did they had horrific consequences? Sure enough. Did something good happened because of it that would not have happened otherwise? Definitely yes, namely, you and I are here. More importantly, the incarnation and the resurrection and the Blessed Virgin mother and the whole redemption story. This pretty much sums up my rejoinder.

On the other hand, if you mean something like finding a *moral justification* for God's actions, you are correct that I did not do, and I hasten to add that I will *not* do it, because in my view that is a meaningless question and a reading of the book of Job should cure one of such attempts.      ""My suggestion is not my non-existence as being preferable but rather that your view of what happened is incorrect because it is implausible.""      Now you gesture vaguely that there is some ""alternative"", but you have not presented such; I do not dispute that God could have created other worlds (in the sense of an entire universe with a different history altogether), worlds where the fall did not happen or Satan qua Satan does not exist. What I did and do dispute is that such an alternative world is better, or even better in some qualified sense. (1) We cannot possibly ascertain such things, because we have neither the criteria nor the knowledge. (2) Good things happened because of the rebellion and the fall happened, good things that would not have happened otherwise and (3) preferring an alternative world where I do not exist is incoherent, which is what the logic of your argument entails.

1584,"Now to top things off, there is a common and sinful calumny that comes from the recent disciples of VB that those who believe that hell is and will be occupied want people to be in hell. They are like greedy misers counting coins, but instead they are counting the number of souls in hell and delighting in every enumeration of an additional soul. Those who make these calumnious accusations will answer to the judge of the living and the dead whether or not they believe in the final judgement. Uncharitable habits such as these occur again in the writings of David Hart. The convenient thing about being a universalist is that you can ignore Christ’s commandment to love your neighbor in charitable discourse and can look upon everyone who disagrees with you as an idiot. The inconvenient part about being a universalist is that you will answer to the judge of the living and the dead for the damnable consequences of such a lack of charity. In my estimation, the inconvenient part heavily outweighs the convenient part.      So now to address this calumny. The reason that I care about this issue is the same reason that the popes who condemned positions like what I noted above cared about them.

It's entirely reasonable to challenge, and perhaps dismiss, any particular plan of action. But the way to do that is to replace one plan with another, not to merely content ourselves with rejectionism.      What typically happens is that somebody will suggest some plan, everyone else will immediately starting proclaiming it wrong, while offering no plan of their own, and so nothing happens, and centuries of racial divide continues.

3336,"@Uncommon Descent      I don't think you have understood the account of charity given in this post. Charity or love is to will the good of another person. This is the highest call of the Christian and a fulfilment of the entire law. We are called to love God above all things and to love our neighbor as ourselves. It is in this that Christians reflect the image of God who is love itself. It is in this that we show the Spirit of love dwelling within us as ""the love of God is poured into [our] hearts through the Holy Spirit who is given to us"" (Rom 5:5). It is this love that causes us to obey Christ's commands as Jesus taught ""If you love me you will keep my commands"" (John 14:15). The significance of this love for our salvation is that ""Christ is the source of eternal salvation for those who obey Him"" Hebrews 5:9).      This love is even greater than faith (1 Cor 13). Even with faith to move mountains, without love we are nothing (1 Cor 13). It is this love that causes our faith to work as what counts is ""faith working through love"" (Gal 5:6).      Again, this is the entire law: to love God and to love neighbor as oneself. Such love is reflected in the 10 commandments with the first 3 being about loving God and the second 7 being about loving neighbor. It is for this reason that Jesus responded to the rich young ruler's question (""what must I do to be saved?"") by quoting the commandments and then calling him to an act of love for the poor. It is for this reason that Jesus will separate the sheep and the goats based on whether or not they cared for those without clothes, food, and those imprisoned. We will be judged in the end on whether or not love dwells within us. As God is love itself and this love it poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, it is this love by which we ""remain in Christ"" as branches remain in the vine. This occurs when we love even our enemies as Christ calls us to do.      This does not mean that we never correct our enemies or rebuke them. Rebuking a sinner to stop sinning is an act of love. It is a work of mercy. So is instructing those that are ignorant. The key point in the post above is that we should not easily default into thinking that those who disagree with us are malicious. Having that as a default approach is neither reasonable nor charitable and given the centrality of both charity and truth in the Christian life, such an approach is not a Christian approach to discourse.",uncommon descent think understood account charity given post charity love good another person highest call christian fulfilment entire law called love god thing love neighbor christian reflect image god love show spirit love dwelling within u love god poured heart holy spirit given u rom love cause u obey command jesus taught love keep command john significance love salvation christ source eternal salvation obey hebrew love even greater faith cor even faith move mountain without love nothing cor love cause faith work count faith working love gal entire law love god love neighbor oneself love reflected commandment first loving god second loving neighbor reason jesus responded rich young question must saved quoting commandment calling act love poor reason jesus separate sheep goat based whether cared without clothes food imprisoned judged end whether love dwells within u god love love poured heart holy spirit love remain christ branch remain vine occurs love even enemy christ call u mean never correct enemy rebuke rebuking sinner stop sinning act love work mercy instructing ignorant key point post easily default thinking disagree u malicious default approach neither reasonable charitable given centrality charity truth christian life approach christian approach discourse,feser,2453,0

1400,"I would add: if one is growing, and the other is not, **that very growth** should imply you exercise patience and understanding toward the one lagging behind. If you have been given a gift more than another person, do not cast off the other as unworthy: it was a GIFT to you, not your own merit that brought it. Why, therefore, would you despise the person who has not received the gift, in which state _you would still be if you had not been granted the gift?_      And further: by patiently asking God that He also shower your spouse with comparable gifts of growth, mayhap you will merit God granting such growth. So: your observing a lack in your spouse is _reason to do something to help your spouse (by prayer and sacrifice),_ not reason to leave.      And further: do not let pride deceive you: if you see that you have grown in _one_ way (where your spouse has not), never forget that perhaps your spouse has grown in 3 or 4 ways less visible, where you have not. There are a thousand different avenues of growth, not one or two. God works at a different pace in each area, for each person. And not all growth is manifest to either the person growing or to those around.      Never imagine that ""incompatibility"" due to one person growing and the other not constitutes a basis for believing the marriage is ""void"". God's will for marriage is that it persist through life, even in difficult times, even in the difficulties of difficult personality clashes. Growth, alone, is not incompatibility, and even if there were some incompatibility - even if (in spite of charitable efforts) one spouse becomes _impossible_ to live with, (say, you became a Catholic and your spouse simply could not stand that) and a legal separation is necessary, that **does not void or break** the marriage, it merely means that you should live apart from your spouse for some time.

Let’s recap: your initial claim is that the logical problem of evil provides good philosophical reasons not to believe in the God of classical theism because it shows there is no way to reconcile the bad things that happen to people with “Omni” attributes we want to affirm about God.      A response to this claim was then given that one possible “out” that can preserve these divine attributes by hypothesizing that God could make restitution to the wronged parties in the next life.      You then made a bunch of irrelevant remarks about how everyone who disagrees with you on this topic is stupid, and most people probably gave up on the conversation. But now we actually have a non-trivial and non-circular response! An immortal soul cannot exist that survives after death because we don’t know how a soul interacts with the brain, so it is therefore impossible for God to offer restitution to a person after death.      Now that we have that all our of the way, ready for the philosophy? You sure? Ok here it is:      I reject your premise. An unsolved question is not a demonstration that two concepts are incompatible.      This is further justified by the arguments that Dr. Feser has made here (and others have made elsewhere) that the mind cannot be wholly materially determinate, and that there must be an immaterial component to our thoughts (which is positive evidence for the soul).

Now, this is an example of what I have been trying to say.      Leaving aside the fact that the text tried to implicitly assert the plausibility of the mitochondria theory as a 'known fact' or true without arguing - when it's in fact just a theory among others. Look what they say about animals - especially multicellular ones. And besides the fact of the 'magical' conjoining of diverse cells or microorganisms inside microorganisms, they are doing exactly as I said in the example.      As I said, this sounds insane. But based on your comments and @Tom Cohoe - and some things I read of Ed's work - I think we can say something about this. First, even though this is all true and or cells and etc. we're co-opted by 'who knows why' to work together, the history is very different now than it was long ago. Our ACTUAL existence is not like it was long ago. They say in the text that the microorganisms that formed the mitochondria were separable in principle - at least they suppose it is that way. In our actual existence, we can't separate our parts and expect them to work ALONE or in the same way, as it was long ago (again, supposing that they were right) because they are organs - parts of substances - not substances in their own right.      But one of the major problems I think that all of this has (and I'm basing myself on somewhat the same analysis that Ed does when discussing atomism in his Scholastic Metaphysics book) is when it comes to the first organism because the first organism on earth necessarily had parts that work together - and work for him. So, even if they say that our unity is an accidental one (like atomists say), they can't get rid of substance (and prime matter) in the first place (like atomists).      What do you guys think?

1860,"I am glad we agree on the subject of heresy, and retract my comment that you were incorrect on that point.      But your point about the Council still does not stand. They were in fact making a *historical* claim in judging Honorius guilty of heresy. Councils can be incorrect about historical claims. You say this:       _First, the reason a council condemns someone as a heretic is because of his teaching. Hence it is, first and foremost, Honorius’s teaching that was condemned. That means that the teaching was judged heretical. But whether a teaching is heretical is a doctrinal matter, and not a mere historical matter. Now, given that a papally-approved council cannot err on doctrinal matters, it follows that the councils in question infallibly judged that Honorius’s teaching was heretical (whatever his intentions). But since anyone who teaches heresy is a heretic, it follows (at least given that Honorius really did write the letters that got him into trouble, as most of his defenders concede) that these councils did after all infallibly judge that Honorius was a heretic._      This does not follow. The councils judged that *monotheilitism was a heresy*, which is completely true. They then made the historical claim that *Honorius was a heretic*, which is not protected by any infallible charism whatsoever. The key point protected by infallibility is not that Honorius was a heretic; it's that monothelitism is a heresy. Whether or not Honorius actually taught monthelitism cannot be established merely by the council's say-so. That simply is not a doctrinal claim.      You then say this:       _Second, the reason most of Honorius’s defenders try to defend him is to avoid having to acknowledge that a pope can teach heresy when not speaking ex cathedra. Now, suppose that the councils did indeed get it wrong when judging that Honorius, specifically, was a heretic. Since that is a historical rather than doctrinal matter, such an error is possible. Still, by making this judgment, the councils also taught by implication that it is possible for a pope to teach heresy (when not speaking ex cathedra). And that is a doctrinal matter. That is enough to refute the larger claim that Honorius’s defenders are trying to uphold by defending him._      A Pope can speak heresy, potentially; a Pope cannot teach heresy in the capacity of utilizing his magisterial authority to bind the faithful to religious assent of will, because then the Magisterium would be leading the faithful off the path of salvation. And as you happily acknowledge, what the councils were condemning as heresy is not the understanding that Vatican I used and is in fact not sinful, because monothelitism had yet to be condemned directly in a Church council or by an authoritative papal teaching.      Also, I am supremely unconvinced that a private letter can ever be an act of Magisterial teaching in any case, and not simply the private opinion of the man who happened to be Pope.      Also you say this:       _Wright neglects to mention the opinion of St. Francis de Sales, who, when addressing papal authority in The Catholic Controversy, says that “we do not say that the Pope cannot err in his private opinions, as did John XXII, or be altogether a heretic, as perhaps Honorius was” (p. 225)._      Wright ""neglected to mention"" him because St. Francis De Sales is clearly not condemning Honorius, merely mentioning in passing that he PERHAPS was a heretic.

2282,"""I think it would be closer to say that you completely misunderstand, since almost all of what you say is tangential, not contradictory, to what I said""      Well, it seemed to me that you had reduced relevant moral norms to customs and a ""framework of human practices and institutions"", and I strongly disagree with that. That human suffering is (ceteris paribus, to avoid soul-building considerations) something lamentable is a necessary truth, for example.      ""But you are evidently fatally deceived as to the meaning of that term, since you believe (apparently?!) that creatures ""come to possess"" these same eminent perfections when they are perfected""      They do not come to possess the same exact thing univocally (which in God would only be one perfection), but whatever they actuality come to possess must be pre-contained within God in at least the same degree or in a greater way. As such, every actuality in our ""moral agency"" must be present in God, and *not* in an inferior way. Every actuality, not every limitation. If God possessed our perfection of Intellect in a way that made him unable to know things, that would be absurd. It would be inferior. If God possessed our perfection of moral agency in such a way that he could not know moral truths (""rape is wrong"", ""human suffering is ceteris paribus bad and to be avoided"", etc) and could not act in accordance with moral truths or practical judgment, then it would be an inferior actuality. Which would be absurd.      So you are turning the discussion into something else - I never said anything that was incompatible with analogy, for instance; I was even quite explicit in saying that God's formal possession of our perfections (again, see Garrigou- Lagrange for example) does not deny analogy. And you are missing the point that if moral agency is a pure perfection (like wisdom is), then it is also proper to say God is a moral agent. Except if you wanna reject that God is wise, perhaps.      But if God did not know you existed or that you and I were having this conversation, this would certainly be a problem and he would not be ""God"" in the way that believers take him to be. And not in the sense that believers might have mistaken views of God (thinking he has real parts for instance, or is changing or whatever), but in a sense that would make most of them conclude that God would (absurdly) be seriously defective, and not worthy of worship at all.      It's not that hard, actually. If God is indifferent to (e.g.) a child being tortured to the point where he could simply not bother to do anything to stop or prevent it, when it is in his power to do so, then God would be seriously defective, unimpressive and unworthy of love and worship.      In which case he would not be God, as God is supposed to be.      But then God cannot be indifferent to that kind of stuff, i.e. prima facie, if God exists, he should be stopping or preventing these evils, unless he has morally sufficient reasons for not doing so (and then we're back to standard theodicy, skeptical theism, etc. Which us theists cannot avoid.)",think would closer say completely misunderstand since almost say tangential contradictory said well seemed reduced relevant moral norm custom framework human practice institution strongly disagree human suffering ceteris paribus avoid soul-building consideration something lamentable necessary truth example evidently fatally deceived meaning term since believe apparently creature come posse eminent perfection perfected come posse exact thing univocally god would one perfection whatever actuality come posse must pre-contained within god least degree greater way every actuality moral agency must present god inferior way every actuality every limitation god possessed perfection intellect way made unable know thing would absurd would inferior god possessed perfection moral agency way could know moral truth rape wrong human suffering ceteris paribus bad avoided etc could act accordance moral truth practical judgment would inferior actuality would absurd turning discussion something else - never said anything incompatible analogy instance even quite explicit saying formal possession perfection see garrigou- lagrange example deny analogy missing point moral agency pure perfection like wisdom also proper say god moral agent except wan na reject god wise perhaps god know existed conversation would certainly problem would god way believer take sense believer might mistaken view god thinking real part instance changing whatever sense would make conclude god would absurdly seriously defective worthy worship hard actually god indifferent eg child tortured point could simply bother anything stop prevent power god would seriously defective unimpressive unworthy love worship case would god god supposed god indifferent kind stuff ie prima facie god exists stopping preventing evil unless morally sufficient reason back standard theodicy skeptical theism etc u theist avoid,feser,3096,0
1832," _Is that swapping of caps problematic on your view?_      No, this is no problem for me: I **expressly said** that if the pope (or any other bishop) gives a caveat that makes it clear that they ARE NOT intending their comment to be taken as ""official"" or not as from them qua _teacher_ , it is not magisterial. (It may have been in the prior post that I said this. Not sure which one.)      _I'm reading you (maybe) as saying or implying that the assertions of a pope in faith or morals cannot fail to be 'binding' on any Catholic to some extent, whether the pope likes it or not; or maybe that this is so, at least by default._      I am saying that the ""bindingness"" is a matter of degree, just as is the _intention_ and the _manner in which the intention is expressed_ are manifestly capable of degree. All commentators agree that there are different levels of authoritativeness to different kinds of papal documents, from Apostolic Constitutions through encyclicals and such, down to other actions. And all agree that the pope can emphasize his teaching with different levels of formality and different levels of insistence. Just reading through JPII's encyclicals gives you a wide range of statements he makes that land at widely different levels of insistence that Catholics be guided by his teaching. It's not an on/off switch, with nothing in between.      _his 'manifest will' refers especially to his intention to teach and bind the faithful of the world. Normally he will not express this intention in so many words, but it can be known 'either from the character of the documents, from his frequent repetition of the same doctrine, or from his manner of speaking.'_      These last points, i.e. _markers_ of the pope's intention, clearly are of the kind that are capable of degree. Especially ""frequent repetition of the same doctrine"" - if the pope (and the Church) want frequent repetition to be used as a marker, it is necessarily the case that a teaching pass **_only gradually_** from ""newly proposed"" to ""long-standing teaching"" by which the Church expresses ""we're serious about this..."".",swapping cap problematic view problem expressly said pope bishop give caveat make clear intending comment taken official qua teacher magisterial may prior post said sure one reading maybe saying implying assertion pope faith moral fail binding catholic extent whether pope like maybe least default saying bindingness matter degree intention manner intention expressed manifestly capable degree commentator agree different level authoritativeness different kind papal document apostolic constitution encyclical action agree pope emphasize teaching different level formality different level insistence reading encyclical give wide range statement make land widely different level insistence catholic guided teaching onoff switch nothing manifest refers especially intention teach bind faithful world normally express intention many word known either character document frequent repetition doctrine manner speaking last point ie marker intention clearly kind capable degree especially frequent repetition doctrine - pope church want frequent repetition used marker necessarily case teaching pas gradually newly proposed long-standing teaching church express serious,feser,2108,0

3332,"Again, the point is not to deny that people sometimes really do have bad motives and opinions. Nor is it to deny that it is in some cases justifiable to be harsh with such a person, when his opinions are dangerous and he puts them forward in an obnoxious or irrational way.  The point is that this should be a last resort, not the first, and in modern mass media people tend instead to be too “quick on the trigger.” As Aquinas says, “when a man hates or despises another, or is angry with or envious of him, he is led by slight indications to think evil of him, because everyone easily believes what he desires.” We like to think that the reason we dislike a person is that he has bad motives or irrational views. But sometimes we attribute bad motives or irrational views to him precisely because we dislike him.

3302,"@ Laudator Temporis Acti,      ""He doesn't ""want"" 127 to be a prime and 128 to be a power of 2. They are those things per se.""      They are these things for either one of two reasons.      First, they are so because of a system of axioms with rules of inference that allows us to prove it as a conclusion of a formal argument. This method of proof is not necessarily connected with the world we measure and physically inhabit. For example, without the infinite parallel postulate the axioms can have added to them an intrinsic curvature in which by locally parallel transport a circle can be constructed whose area is a rational multiple of its radius and this circle can definitely be squared.      So much for ""per se"" or human fiat. I don't even have to invoke the God beyond human understanding to get that.      The second method is by measuring the physical world we inhabit and building up a finite mathematics which cannot be fudged up by arbitrarily adding axioms which have not been physically proven themselves.      Well it is just God's choice (will) that the local physics supports your system. We can examine what God *can* do by examining what a model of God allows, but we cannot examine what God *cannot* do this way because God is greater than a model of God (a picture of you can show your hair color but it can't jump or walk - but you can jump or walk and jump because you are not limited by what the picture cannot do) . If you conclude from a model that God cannot do something, you have only proved that it can't be done in the model - which is not God.      A good physical model of God is a computer with a program. A computer program exists in which any circle, measured in the program, is exactly 6 times its radius. This can be illustrated as a virtual reality in which virtual actors measure virtual circles and always get that result. It can be shown as a visual animation that can be watched, as in a computer game. This is a model of God. If it can be made logical (in the measuring sense, the second method of proof, in which axioms are experimentally determined as described above) on a computer, then God can make it logical in physical reality, which, of course, would be a different physical reality then the one we have come to know and love.      Similarly, God is not limited to creating a physical universe where 127 is prime and 128 is a power of 2. It just outrages your sense of mathematical truth as it is known to you from living in this universe, but emotion doesn't belong in mathematical proofs (in this universe).      It is just an old ""rule"" without ground that mathematics and logic are independent of God. It is just an assumption.      ""So who is right?""      That you cannot, in your mind, know who is right does not mean that there is no truth or that no one can enunciate it on a particular matter. That 15 people give different accounts of some event does not mean that none of the accounts are correct. If you drive from Topeka to Billings and two witnesses disagree on what you had for lunch, that does not mean that neither of them were correct. You had a tuna and marshmallow sandwich.

1014,"I think people sometimes take original sin too much like a theory of physics. Once you do that it can lead to misunderstandings. Perhaps think of it instead as God creating nature with a telos, in fact a hierarchy of teloi, with everything drawn towards his divine idea(l)s (using Augustines terms). What the fall represents is us starting to choose our own sub-teloi, of having “knowledge” of what is “good” for us. Once we do the conscious choosing, we generally do a pretty bad job of it, as can be seen immediately with Cain, and that has consequences that ripple across everything. Like a stone thrown into a calm pond.      In order to recover our correct place in nature so that we can become participants in God’s original creation, working with him rather that towards our own faulty choice of sub-telos, we have to aim towards God’s original idea(l) of man.      Fortunately He has helped us hugely here. The incarnation was not just(!) the sacrifice that gained the reconciliation of the consequences of our bad choices, it also gave us the perfect example of the divine ideal we were created to be. So in choosing to be more like him, as far as we can in our puny efforts, we become participants in God’s great act of creation that is this universe (and we get help in this). On this path even the delights of the world become good, and we can have life to the full (though not without suffering yet).      If we don’t - but rather continue to create our own sub-teloi - then even good intentions can lead us away from completion, away from union with the creator. For those whose chosen teloi, their highest good and highest desires, are the base pleasures of the world, it is them who are choosing eternal torment. We are made to rest in Him, not in base things which will always bring their own suffering.

This is supposed to be bad.      The left wing version is that immigrants, especially immigrants of color, trend more to the left than people who were born in the country, so that leftists will “replace” conservatives. This is supposed to be good.      Both versions of the theory are nuts.      As to the former version: If the country becomes browner in a few generations, so be it.

2702,"Regarding the council of Orange and semi-pelagianism: Here again, this assertion reflects a high level of confidence and a high level of ignorance mixed in a toxic cocktail. Pelagianism is a heresy. And Church councils condemn heresy, rather than upholding a moderated version of heresy (i.e. semi-heresy).Semi-pelagianism, which is imprecise and often undefined, denies the role of God's grace in the initial movement of the will toward God. This is denied by both the Council of Orange and St. Augustine. In fact it is condemned by the Council of Orange as heresy. So, the council of Orange *nowhere* condemned St. Augustine. It did however condemn a version of the very same heresy that St. Augustine fought so tirelessly against.      Now, the key here for anyone who cares about orthodoxy is that heresy and orthodoxy are not defined by the self-appointed pope WCB. It is defined by the Church that the Scripture's refer to as ""the pillar and foundation of truth"" and which Christ said ""the gates of hell will not prevail against it"". Satan is the father of lies and where lies prevail (e.g. in the thought of WCB), there Satan prevails. This has not and cannot happen in Christ's Church which is the pillar and foundation of truth. So, as I mentioned below, WCB, no one here is interested in joining the cult of WCB. Your judgements are pervasively erroneous and you should consider tempering that unflinching confidence in your own wisdom. Trusting that rickety old bridge is going to lead you to fall into a pit.      As a final note to the interested reader, it is not enough to read Scripture and quote it. We have to interpret it correctly and there is such a thing as a heretical interpretation (for examples of this, review the writings of WCB). Pelagius was, after all, not reading the funny papers when he arrived at his position that ""there was when the word was not"". He was reading the book of Proverbs and offering a heretical interpretation of this book (He also wrote a commentary on Romans.). So, it is not enough to quote Scripture. Satan quoted Scripture. You have to interpret it truly with the pillar and foundation of truth and this involves submitting to the judgements of Church councils which are under the guidance of the Holy Spirit as we see in Acts 15 from St. James' words (""it seemed good to us and to the Holy Spirit"") as the council sent out letters to the Churches notifying all Christians of the decision of the council. They did not say, ""well take a bible--if your literate--and decide what you think on this issue and, if you are not literate, just follow whoever is most able to convince you with ""smooth and flattering words that will ""tickle your ears"" (two quotes from Scripture, I will leave to the reader to look them up).

In the temporal paradise nothing would end it except a voluntary exit (freely choosing to turn away from the presence of God). So an infinitude of time was available, unmarred by fear, aging, or death.      Now let us look at the simple model of human free will in time (in the temporal paradise) - an infinite sequence of unbiased bits, in which lies all possible intelligible choices encoded one way or other (you, Walter, can choose any encoding method subject to finite computation).      To be unbiased, the infinite sequence would have to contain, as a subsequence, the choice to turn away from God (exit paradise). If the infinite sequence did not contain the choice as a subsequence, the infinite sequence would not be an unbiased random sequence and it would not be simple but would be complex.      So the free choice to turn from God, given endless time, is inevitable.      ""I suppose that makes sense to someone who treats logic (and God) as contingent.""

3395,"Where the study of consciousness is concerned, recent philosophy of mind has followed David Chalmers in distinguishing between “easy problems” and the “hard problem.” Identifying the neural correlates of various kinds of conscious awareness would be examples of an easy problem. By characterizing such a problem as “easy,” Chalmers doesn’t mean that it is trivial, or even easy in every respect. He just means that it is the sort of problem the solution to which seems clearly attainable using existing methods and standard scientific and philosophical assumptions. The “hard problem” is explaining why any of the neural processes in question are associated with conscious awareness, given that it seems at least prima facie possible that they could do what neuroscience describes them as doing in the complete absence of consciousness. (This is alleged to be shown by arguments like Chalmers’ [“zombie argument,”](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2013/12/zombies- shoppers-guide.html) along with other influential arguments like Frank Jackson’s [“knowledge argument”](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2010/07/when-frank-jilted- mary.html) and [Thomas Nagel’s argument](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2012/04/reading-rosenberg- part-x.html) in his famous article “What is it Like to Be a Bat?”)",study consciousness concerned recent philosophy mind followed david chalmers distinguishing “ easy problem ” “ hard problem ” identifying neural correlate various kind conscious awareness would example easy problem characterizing problem “ easy ” chalmers mean trivial even easy every respect mean sort problem solution seems clearly attainable using existing method standard scientific philosophical assumption “ hard problem ” explaining neural process question associated conscious awareness given seems least prima facie possible could neuroscience describes complete absence consciousness alleged shown argument like “ zombie argument ” httpsedwardfeserblogspotcomzombies- shoppers-guidehtml along influential argument like frank “ knowledge argument ” httpsedwardfeserblogspotcomwhen-frank-jilted- maryhtml thomas argumenthttpsedwardfeserblogspotcomreading-rosenberg- part-xhtml famous article “ like bat ”,feser,1296,0

My intentions have no prior cause; I just have them, and that's all. So too with God.""      Gratuitously asserted...?      And God said, ""Let there be..."" But, per Vincent, first, 'logically' speaking, he formed (quite _un_ intentionally, apparently!) a prior intention/plan that he would say ""Let there be..."" -- and to be clear, he didn't need to form a _prior_ prior intention (a second-order prior intention) in order form the aforementioned prior intention, because 'logically' (Vincent says) one must form intentions _before acting_ ; and so clearly forming an intention/making a plan is not itself an action; otherwise one would always have to form an(other) intention before forming any intention, so that it would be impossible to ever get started forming an intention/making a plan.      So the question remains, if forming an intention/making a plan is not an action (as it can't be on Vincent's account), then what is it?      Vincent again: ""I maintain that God has thoughts of His own, which are in some sort of Divine language, and these thoughts are what makes God personal.""      It's not at all clear what the point here is, but why not instead the converse: God's thoughts are what make _us_ personal?

In response to the suggestion made by some that the council criticized Honorius only in some weaker manner than it did the Monothelite heretics, Mann says that “it seems, however, more likely that they did” condemn him in the same manner, and that “it cannot… be denied that it is more natural to assume that all those condemned by the council were all condemned in the same sense” (p. 343).

But this mechanistic model only works when we abstract out of it anything that smacks of the psychological – consciousness, intentionality, and so on. (This is precisely why Descartes had to relocate consciousness out of the material world and in a separate _res cogitans_ , as Chomsky himself emphasizes later in the discussion with Goff and Frankish.)

3309,"The famous paragraph slipped into the Fourth Council of Constantinople’s deliberations had more to do with the inflamed politics of the East than the wrongs of Pope Honorius. The Lateran Council of 649, rejecting Monothelitism, had blamed the orientals, making no mention of Pope Honorius. Pope Agatho got his legates to bring to the Council of Constantinople a letter in which he stated: “From the day when the leaders of the Church of Constantinople tried to introduce heretical novelties in the immaculate Church of Christ, my predecessors never ceased to exhort them… that they had to abstain… [from proclaiming the error concerning the single will etc.]”.      The Council’s machinations contradicted Pope Agatho and resulted in a wording that was modified by Pope Leo II (upon receiving notice of its deliberations) when he ratified it. This was the version he then sent to Constantinople and all the bishops of the West. Pope Leo, in his explanation of the affair to the bishops of Spain, clearly distinguished between the list of heretics named by the Council, and Pope Honorius, censured for being negligent.         In a long article in the Dictionnaire de theolgie catholique (1931, the DTC was in another league entirely from the estimable Catholic Encyclopedia), Fr. E. Amann, professor of theology at Strasbourg, concludes: “For us, the two letters of Pope Honorius represent a doctrinal intervention of the Roman pontiff in a debated question: referring to previous decisions, without adding anything new to them except in manner, the pope teaches the theory of the two natures, each operating according to what is proper to it, and demands entire acceptance of this doctrine. Alongside this doctrinal teaching is a very unfortunate prescription on the silence to be kept relative to the formulas in dispute, ‘one or two energies’”.      He concludes that “… [Honorius’] thought carries greater weight than the formulas by which he expresses it, that these formulas themselves can with the greatest rigor uphold an interpretation which does not deviate too much from official orthodoxy. But to conclude from this, as many theologians have done, the perfect orthodoxy of the two letters of Honorius, there is, it seems, some distance.”      Had the Council made a dangerous mistake? “It would certainly have done so if, taking the question from an exclusively dogmatic point of view, it had passed a doctrinal and pointless judgment on the very teaching of Honorius….[because Honorius was basically orthodox, despite his expressions in these letters] the assembly set itself up as judge much less of a theology than of a type of conduct and those who engaged in it”.      The weak arguments made by some theologians mentioned in the post do not devalue their stronger ones – which don’t get a proper mention; the question of the Pope losing the faith, the issue of formal heresy dealt with by Bellarmine, surely deserves some explanation. As far as the history goes, Pope Honorius was NOT a heretic, and Fr. Chapman’s 100 page work does not establish it.      I think there is a distinction between ex cathedra infallibility (which permits no stain of error) and the foibles of Popes at other times which, however much destruction they cause, does not translate into meaning they can lose the faith. Obviously we aren’t expected to believe that off the cuff “magisterium” on planes is not free from tendentiousness to the point of destructive favouring of whatever error is in fashion. That the man doing this will not lose the faith, ever, is in line with what Vatican One defined concerning the Faith of the See of Rome that would not fail until the end of time. Reducing this to the extraction of ex cathedra statements one a century from men who could otherwise have no faith, or renounce Christ, seems more like the speech of Balaam’s ass.

For example, Bellarmine proposes that “perhaps” Honorius’s letter to Sergius was faked by the heretics, though he also argues that if this theory is rejected, the letter can be given an orthodox reading.

1051,"@ Walter Van den Acker,      Original sin was the fall of creation and suffering was the consequence of this fall. We are all in this fallen creation. No one is being ""punished"", not even Adam and Eve. They just inevitably chose sin given free will and time. Human free will can also be modelled by an infinite unbiased random binary sequence so all choices exist in it somewhere (as simple a model as you are likely to find). Adam and Eve, in time, chose to leave temporal paradise and enter the fallen creation. Knowledge of good and evil meant a return to temporal paradise was gone without the intervention of God to bring them to the new creation, the eternal (outside of time) paradise with God.      This is where we are, all of us, people, babies, good people, bad people, dogs, ticks, mosquitos, and viruses. There is only one creation (simplicity again). We are all in it together. God did not cause multiple worlds for each to choose, and by the choice define right and wrong (for you are the one claiming to redefine things, not me). As a human with an infinite component to your mind, since you are free, you can always choose your own way to stay separate from God. In eternity (outside of time), when the new creation replaces this one, choosing will no longer be possible, so if you have elected to be separate from God, you will stay separate from God.      The world we live in is not so by necessity. It could have been anything (modelled by the random sequence). It could have been a world in which 1+ 1 is 3 and the rules of logic could have been anything. But the world we live in is the way it is because of love. Love, not necessity. Love is why after inevitably (given endless time) exiting temporal paradise, there is still Salvation if you freely choose it.

In the above example given by our esteemed Anonymous above, if we assume 1=2, does it STILL remain true that ""equals subtracted from equals make equals"", which he uses to get the second step? Maybe not. So then you have to hypothesize not only ""1=2"" but also ""and all the usual rules of arithmetic remain valid"".

2178,"Hi everyone,      Thanks you all for your responses.      Talmid, you write: ""Either it [Pure Existence] is infinite or it is finite. But if PE was finite them it would be a certain form of existence and so not PE, which is contradictory, so PE has to be infinite.""      What your argument really proves is that the notion of ""pure existence"" is utterly amorphous: it is not tied to any particular form. But by the same token, since it has no form, we cannot say that it is positively infinite, either; all we can say is that it has no positive characteristics at all.      RunDec, you object to my assertion that the alleged distinction between a thing's essence and its existence can be explained in terms of the form-matter distinction, by arguing as follows: ""the existence of an animal might require its material exemplification, but this is not the case with immaterial beings (such as souls, angels, God, or any other candidates).""      Re separated souls: at least we can say that they once had bodies and that they will one day have them back, so we can regard them as being ""branded,"" so to speak, by the matter they informed. Re angels: I'm sure you're well aware that there were many medieval philosophers who held that angels are not pure forms, but possess a kind of spiritual matter, allowing two or more angels to be of the same species. As for God, His essence and existence are commonly held to be identical, anyway.      You also ask, ""if God had an accident distinct from himself (his essence), where would this accident come from? It can't come from the essence lest you accept the precedence of a perfectly simple Essence which is the source of all things, which is what you're trying to avoid.""      I'm quite happy to say that God's essence is simple. What I insist is that God's Mind or Essence has multiple thoughts and intentions which are contingent accidents - e.g. God's concept of this universe, and His intention to make it.      You deny that having an intention is a necessary condition for making a choice because ""if it were, we would never be able to choose anything, since we would have to choose our intention before being able to make a choice, and that is circular or regressive."" However, your argument misconstrues my position, which is that an agent's choice to do something must be (at least logically, even if not temporally) preceded by a plan or intention to do it. Otherwise, it would be impossible to attribute an action A to spiritual agent X rather than spiritual agent Y, as neither of them would have done anything to identify it as the cause of A. But although I produce things (or states of affairs) as an agent, I do not ""produce"" my intentions; I just have them. They are voluntary, but not in the same sense that my actions are. My intentions have no prior cause; I just have them, and that's all. So too with God.      I don't have any problem with an agent either choosing to bring about X or choosing not to bring about X, and having an identical causal history in both cases. What bothers me is the notion of an agent acting without a plan. That just makes no sense. Cheers.      William,      While Ed doesn't deny that God is personal, He construes God's personhood in terms of His possessing an intellect (and will), which in turn is construed in terms of God being Pure Act and containing (eminently) every form which He generates, within Himself, since He is Pure Being. Thus God's personhood is grounded in impersonal notions like ""being"" and ""act"": for Thomists, these are what God is, primarily. I maintain that God has thoughts of His own, which are in some sort of Divine language, and these thoughts are what makes God personal.      I hope Ed spoils himself this Christmas and buys himself a copy of Professor Francesca Stavrakopoulou's ""God: An Anatomy."" It will change the way he thinks about the God of the Bible. Cheers.

3361,"Thank you for this much needed and helpful post.      @Infinite Growth:      St. Paul did not forbid all judgement. If he did, he would not have written in 1 Corinthians 5:3, ""For I, on my part, thought absent in body but present in spirit have already judged him who has so so committed this, as though I were present.""      St. Paul is referred to a man who is sleeping with his father's wife whom the Corinthians have not rebuked out of a disordered tolerance that is so well described in Feser's post above.      Some of the distinctions in the post that are also found in St. Thomas are helpful to determine in what conditions a judgement can be made without being rash. One important distinction is between an exterior act (someone's actions which we can see) and an interior act (an inward intention which only God can see). You can judge an act and recognize that it is wrong without attributing to the person malice. The person may be acting wrongly out of ignorance and this is significantly less culpable than malice. In that instance, you could approach someone calmly and explain to them why the exterior act was not moral. This would be an act of mercy that the Church calls ""Instructing the ignorant."" Again you can do this without assuming that the person is either malicious or an imbecile. In fact, to instruct someone actually presumes goodwill. It presumes that they care about the truth and that if you take the time to explain the truth, that they will be inclined to follow it.      So, we have to make distinctions about what being judged and this can help us from making assumptions about intentions which we cannot be sure of without knowing someone's character and habits. This does not prevent us from judging the exterior acts of anyone even if we don't know them. Nor does it prevent us from assessing their assertions even if we don't know them.      It is also important to highlight that we can get to know someone's character and can make judgement's on that. In this, we just have to be much more careful and, again, err on the side of charity for their good and ours. However, if someone habitually steals or commits adultery or lies, we don't have to pretend that they have a good character when it is obvious that they don't.

But he teaches here that it is _not_ justifiable to refrain from such criticism merely because it is difficult, or because we fear causing offense and losing friends, or because we don’t want to risk losing status or other worldly goods. For the wicked are in danger _of damnation_ if they do not repent, and we “wickedly blind ourselves” if we shirk our duty to encourage them to do so.

2794,"@Tony      It should be mentioned that the quote on the understanding to be given to the term 'proselytism' when it appears in Church documents, taken from a 2007 CDF document under Benedict XVI ('Doctrinal Note on some Aspects of Evangelization'), is a footnote (49) from a text whose main body is entirely devoted to the legitimacy of sharing one's faith.      Even in ordinary language, the term 'proselytism' does have a vaguely negative connotation these days, so it is fair enough that the Church has chosen to deploy it to denote negative ways of promoting the faith, while giving this clarifying definition in the 2007 document.      The same magisterial document explains: ‘Everywhere and always, each Catholic has the right and the duty to give the witness and the full proclamation of his faith. With non-Catholic Christians, Catholics must enter into a respectful dialogue of charity and truth, a dialogue which is not only an exchange of ideas, but also of gifts, in order that the fullness of the means of salvation can be offered to one’s partners in dialogue.

The main arguments for classical theism, he points out, emphasize both that the world is contingent or conditioned in various respects, and that an ultimate explanation of the world must be _un_ conditioned and _non_ -contingent in those respects. (Though, just in case he wouldn’t himself use it, I should note that the language of “conditioned” and “unconditioned” in this context is mine, not Davies’.)

2683,"WCB,      I have already noted Komline's Augustine on the Will in the Oxford Historical Theology series published in 2019. I have also noted some of the relevant works of St. Augustine that you are not familiar with that show that he did not change his position. The work that shows this most clearly is a work written by St. Augustine at the end of his life called: The Retractions. St. Augustine knew that his writings would be maintained and widely read after his death because his fame was already so widespread during his life. He was also, like any faithful Catholic, concerned about orthodoxy and that he did not lead others into error in any way. This reflects his charity, which is why he was a saint.      In order to ensure that any mistakes in his writings did not lead others astray, he read through them at the end of his life carefully and retracted any statements that were erroneous. Such retractions are found in his work: The Retractions. This is relevant for our discussion because he revisited his early Cassiacum dialogues, including On the Freedom of the Will. And did he make the sweeping assertion that he completely rejected his early account of the will in this work? Nope. He made small and precise corrections to his cassiacum dialogues while continuing to hold to his main lines of argument within them.      St. Augustine was a clear, compelling, cogent, and precise thinker. That precision entailed that he avoided gross and unsupported generalizations of the sort that fly off your keyboard, WCB. So, no he didn't ""reject his account of the will"". That sweeping generalization has as much support as your other sweeping generalizations. That is, it has no support.

I should clarify that I am *not* dismissing any criticisms of first order logic, or even saying that this way of talking is the best way of talking in every possible practical and theoretical subject. To give a simple, obvious example, as far as I know there is no good satisfactory account of intensional contexts. This way of talking entails no contradictions (or at least any obvious ones) and is especially useful in mathematics though; part of the reasons are certainly contingent and reflect the way how mathematicians are trained, but I would contend that they also reflect a deep intuition. Mathematical objects are simple in the sense that their identity conditions are sharp and clearly delineated -- they are the furthest removed from the material. Virtually all of mathematics can be formalized in ZFC, possibly with some extra large cardinal axioms; *equality* itself can be defined in terms of the other primitives (in symbols: x = y iff forall z, z e x <=> z e y). In this setting, we have: (1) *everything* is a set and (2) *everything* can be constructed bottom up from the empty set via (possibly transfinite) iteration. This is a large amount of reduction and simplification, yielding a powerful framework. But to circle back to the criticisms, it also has its downsides. Now suddenly, it make senses to ask the non-sensical question if the number 5 is an element of the number 1023.

In answer to your question, then, I grant that God had at least one reason not to create. But that is beside the issue.      The issue is the following: Given God’s reasons for and against creating, was it inevitable that God would choose to create? In other words, was God’s choice to create (a) wholly determined by reason or (b) at least partially arbitrary or random?      I argue that (b) is incompatible with classical theism, and I think everyone involved agrees. Thus, we must assert (a) in the alternative.      But (a) means that creation is inevitable.

You conclude that there is a 1% chance that there is a deontic constraint against _ϕ_ ing. If we account for the fact that you shouldn’t violate a deontic constraint to save a million lives by setting a disvalue on violation of deontic constraints greater than the disvalue of a million deaths, then a 1% risk of violating a deontic constraint is worse than ten thousand deaths, and so you shouldn’t _ϕ_ because of the 1% risk of violating a deontic constraint.

Adrian Fonseca is just a news & commentary purveyor, has no authority to hold forth on ""a teaching"". So, absent any new datum, it's ""just some guy bloviating"". Like me, here.      The Chrisitan doctrine on suffering is multi-layered, and should not be reduced to a simple sentence. That said, 4 points are at the heart: (1) not all suffering can be avoided while staying on the right side of the line of good action. (2) When suffering _can_ be avoided by a morally licit choice, it is often prudent (i.e. good, right action) to so. (3) In spite of (2), there are ALSO many situations where some part of suffering can be avoided, but willingly taking on and accepting the suffering (taking the suffering yourself, not subjecting another to the suffering) can be spiritually valuable, and **in general** a good Christian should expect to accept AT LEAST SOME avoidable suffering along his life. (4) Accepting avoidable suffering is _never_ done for its own sake, and therefore it can generally be accounted as being accepted for some other thing, a good that (will) more than offset the evil suffered. This is not intrinsically different from doing (troublesome) exercise to make the body (and soul) stronger - and there is little debate about that kind of ""accepting suffering"".

1198,"Kant took the emergent sense of self of his era, and made it the seat of all knowledge. He first promulgated the belief that it is the subject (the viewer) that is central to knowledge, and not the object viewed. Socratics believed that truth was a quality that existed outside of human perception. It was a philosopher’s job to search it out. Plato, unwittingly, gave a demonstration of this in his famous parable about shadows in a cave that we have touched on. People are chained to a cave wall and can see only shadows thrown from objects passing before a fire behind them. Since this is all they ever see, they will mistake the shadows for reality. In this example, perception is not the seat of knowledge at all, but instead a false prophet. Truth does not exist in the perception of the person in the cave, but is an independent quality that is outside not only the viewer’s perception, but also outside the cave itself. Jesus took this a step further in describing truth not as a quality, but as a god, as independent from a man’s perception as it is possible to be. Truth was God, and came from God, and it was our job to accept God and His will for us. Saint Paul, foremost architect of the Christian church, anticipates Kant’s description of spiritual truth as something outside of sensory perception in I Corinthians Chapter 2: “We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, ... Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared”. In Paul’s view, we don’t get knowledge of God through our senses, but “God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.” Truth is truly outside of ourselves, and absolutely outside of our perception. It must be revealed by God. “Now we have received … the spirit which is of God; that we might know … not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth”. In this case, a viewer’s perception is useless, for truth can be known only through revelation to the spirit. Kant turned this around to teach that we cannot truly know any object outside of ourselves. All we can know is our view of that object. Thus, all knowledge is contingent on the subject, or subjective. There is no truth that we can find in an object, because we see that object only through our view. We see only our piece of it. From this point, he built a philosophical system which used scientific observation as a lens to determine what we can know, how we can know it, and how we learn it and describe it. At the same time, Kant held on to the notion that there may be truth that is outside of our ability to observe its phenomena, and so prove it. In fact, Kant felt he had proved that there were phenomena that did not have any observable traces, and so could not be known. He used the origin of matter in the universe as an example. It is here. It had to get here from somewhere, but where did it come from? Everything we can sense has an action and reaction. Everything has a start. So, what about matter? In short, Kant proved that we see things subjectively, but went on to show that this does not mean that objective truth does not exist, but only that we cannot observe objective truth, since we cannot observe the object itself. I will give you a CliffsNotes version to say that Kant built a science-based philosophy that still left room for Saint Paul’s belief that God’s truth could not come to us through our senses, but only through revelation.",kant took emergent sense self era made seat knowledge first promulgated belief subject viewer central knowledge object viewed socratics believed truth quality existed outside human perception job search plato unwittingly gave demonstration famous parable shadow cave touched people chained cave wall see shadow thrown object passing fire behind since ever see mistake shadow reality example perception seat knowledge instead false prophet truth exist perception person cave independent quality outside perception also outside cave jesus took step describing truth quality god independent perception possible truth god came god job accept god u saint paul foremost architect christian church anticipates description spiritual truth something outside sensory perception corinthian chapter “ speak wisdom god mystery even hidden wisdom eye hath seen ear heard neither entered heart man thing god hath prepared ” view get knowledge god sens “ god hath revealed unto u spirit ” truth truly outside absolutely outside perception must revealed god “ received … spirit god might know … word wisdom teacheth holy ghost teacheth ” case perception useless truth known revelation spirit kant turned around teach truly know object outside know view object thus knowledge contingent subject subjective truth find object see object view see piece point built philosophical system used scientific observation lens determine know know learn describe time kant held notion may truth outside ability observe phenomenon prove fact kant felt proved phenomenon observable trace could known used origin matter universe example get somewhere come everything sense action reaction everything start matter short kant proved see thing subjectively went show mean objective truth exist observe objective truth since observe object give cliffsnotes version say kant built science-based philosophy still left room saint belief truth could come u sens revelation,feser,3476,0
2716,"Even if we look at Eric Perl's treatment of Plotinus's so-called 'necessary emmanation' we see that there is an aspect of necessity involved in it. Perl says on pg. 50 of Theophany, ""The necessity of procession, therefore, is in no sense a limitation on the One, but rather an expression of his absolute freedom from any limiting condition whatsoever."" He's clearly denying that the One is constrained by any 'condition,' but that is something the Thomist would also accept. The 'necessity' refers not to the any external condition, but his pure productivity itself. As Perl says, ""For if the One might not produce being, then his productive activity would be distinct from himself and he would be condition by a relation to his product.""      Why is this relevant? Well, one of the arguments of Perl's book is a situating of Pseudo-Dionysius within a Plotinian and Procline metaphysics. So, Perl goes on to state that ""For Dionysius, as for Plotinus, God is nothing but the making of all things, so that the possibility of not making does not arise.... As in Plotinus, to produce all things is not a ""choice"" on God's part... That God cannot not create is a consequence, not a limitation, of his absolute transcendence, his unrelatedness to that which proceeds from him.""

1629,"Tony, if I understand your post, I agree with most of what you say in it. Thanks to Dr. Feser, I know what an order is in Wullner's sense of that word. But I doubt that sanctifying grace makes a non-Catholic a member of the Church.      I doubt that Pope Pius XII and Msgr. Joseph Clifford Fenton tell us the difference between being a member of the Church and being in the Church as a nonmember of it.      Pius XII and Fenton say that only Catholics are members of the Church since each member of it must meet four requirements. He must wear the baptismal mark on his soul, profess Catholicism, be willing to submit to the pope and to the Church's other legitimate hierarchy, and not be under full excommunication. By those standards, a Protestant in sanctifying grace is in the Church as a nonmember of it.      But the dogma that there's salvation in only the Catholic Church is still true because people can be in the Church as nonmembers of it.      See Mystici Corporis Christi and Msgr. Joseph Clifford Fenton's book ""The Catholic Church and Salvation.""      A non-Catholic is in the Church if there's sanctifying grace in his soul. So he'll die in her if he's in that grace when he does. But his sect doesn't get him to heaven. If he reaches it, he does that despite that sect, not because of it.      That's why Blessed Pope Pius IX writes:   ""Our Predecessor, Gregory XVI, an “insanity,”2 viz., that “liberty of conscience and worship is each man’s personal right, which ought to be legally proclaimed and asserted in every rightly constituted society; and that a right resides in the citizens to an absolute liberty, which should be restrained by no authority whether ecclesiastical or civil, whereby they may be able openly and publicly to manifest and declare any of their ideas whatever, either by word of mouth, by the press, or in any other way.” But, while they rashly affirm this, they do not think and consider that they are preaching “liberty of perdition;”3 and that “if human arguments are always allowed free room for discussion, there will never be wanting men who will dare to resist truth, and to trust in the flowing speech of human wisdom; whereas we know, from the very teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ, how carefully Christian faith and wisdom should avoid this most injurious babbling.”4""      From what you're telling me, I must have misinterpreted John Paul's quotation from Redemptor Hominis. But his Assisi meetings and Vatican II's religious liberty may make some non-Catholics likely to die outside the Church.

1037,"David,      ""And it is absurd to bring to bear the (your) standards of human moral agency to attempt to critique what (little) you understand to be God's exercise of his moral agency.""      I think I can very much make a good analogy here. And my point is I believe I know some necessary moral facts which allow me to say what God can or cannot do (will or will not do). For instance, I am totally confident that it is impossible for God to create a universe consisting of nothing but children being burnt, tortured in horrible pain until they die and are annihilated - they don't even go to heaven eventually, nothing. I am confident that God cannot do that because it would be immoral.   So I can use my knowledge of morality to know what God can or cannot do. Of course, my knowledge will be limited and I could be mistaken about some things, but that goes for anything and it doesn't mean I can't draw rational conclusions here. And of some things I am very confident.      ""(what with ""ceteris paribus""* and all that -- wink wink) it's really not?""      The ceteris paribus clause is there just because I am open to human suffering possibly serving a greater good through e.g. soul-building theodicies, ""becoming stronger/virtuous through pain"", whatever. But the ceteris paribus version of the proposition is still true, and so human suffering is something that God should seek to alleviate/prevent, unless there is a stronger reason why he can't/shouldn't (and that is when we are led to theodicy).      ""But in any case, so what? What are you alleging against the Almighty here? That you're having trouble shaking the suspicion that you might have a better grasp of Necessary Moral Truths than he does?""      No? The point is that if God exists, he cannot fall short of the standards of necessary moral truths as I was talking about. (Indeed, for me he would be the Good itself, and the Good obviously cannot fall short of those moral facts; rather they are supposed to be reflections of the Good, which is only more reason to expect more of him than us, not less). And this sets up the problem of evil, because clearly the world is prima facie a pretty crappy place.      ""It's not that hard, actually. If God is indifferent to (e.g.) a child being tortured... (etc.)""      ""So again, back to the classic question: ""What if God was one of us,""      What if God is truly and perfectly good and wise.      ""But as you yourself say: ""In which case he would not be God, as God is supposed to be."" -- Right, but...""      Yeah, but the point is that the problem of evil is a challenge to God's existence. And it cannot be solved by holding that God, ""not a moral agent"", could really just be indifferent to horrible evils and do nothing about them, and so the existence of horrible evils ""could not possibly be incompatible with him"". This solution doesn't work unless one is okay with (absurdly) turning God into a seriously defective, irrational being, unworthy of worship (because this is what it would be entailed by it for most people, myself included). So the Davies line adds nothing to the problem; at the end of the day, we need the standard responses (skeptical theism, theodicies, etc.). Those responses come with an epistemic cost, but the theist must deal with that.

And when the bishops, in their **ordinary** teachings, teach a truth that is also universally taught by the other bishops, **that** teaching is not only protected _somewhat_ (i.e. like the kind of protection over those teachings to which we owe religious submission), those teachings are infallible and we owe them unreserved assent. So, the bishops in exercising their _ordinary_ teaching office can at least touch on the higher protection, which _suggests_ that they also can touch on the lower protection afforded those teachings to which we owe religious assent - also in their ordinary exercise of their teaching office. That is, both acts are acts of their ordinary teaching office, the difference in the kind of submission we owe being EXTERNAL to the teaching act itself: it is implausible that we would come to owe UNRESERVED assent to a teaching of our bishop once we realize that it has universal agreement of the other bishops, but that _before_ we completed that discovery that we owed it not even the smallest smidgen of religious submission even when we have discovered wide agreement of many bishops (but have not yet established a universal agreement).",well know convince authority teach always connected hears hears latter always part basis position magisterial office protected error though protected every sense pretty odd think christ conveying bishop authority teach name anything protecting said teaching teacher teaching pope bishop ordinary teaching teach truth also universally taught bishop teaching protected somewhat ie like kind protection teaching owe religious submission teaching infallible owe unreserved assent bishop exercising ordinary teaching office least touch higher protection suggests also touch lower protection afforded teaching owe religious assent - also ordinary exercise teaching office act act ordinary teaching office difference kind submission owe external teaching act implausible would come owe unreserved assent teaching bishop realize universal agreement bishop completed discovery owed even smallest smidgen religious submission even discovered wide agreement many bishop yet established universal agreement,feser,1669,0

2567,"Kant was one of the world's greatest thinkers. He phillosophy foresaw quantum mechanics.      Kant did not view things-in-themselves as containing the sum of all possibilities, and phenomena all actualities; but this duality is conformable to Kant's metaphysics as to none other. As a contribution to the metaphysics of possibility, the quantum mechanical wave function can easily be seen as complementary to Kant's idea of things-in-themselves, where various kinds of things can happen (like free will) that are not comprehensible in terms of phenomenal reality. Kant would just have to allow that characteristics of physical reality can intrude some depth into things-in-themselves, which he would not have considered -- though we can also handle this by positing an intermediate level of reality, between true unconditioned things-in-themselves and true discrete phenomenal objects -- as Kant otherwise actually does himself for space and time as ""pure intuitions."" The wave function straddles the classic Kantian boundary, sharing some properties with phenomena, others, as underlying phenomena, with things-in-themselves.      Thus, where Kant would have considered all of phenomena governed by determinism, we now see the wave function as deterministic, while the collapse of waves into particles is random. Although chance in quantum mechanics has often been argued as allowing for free will, a free cause is still a very different thing from a random cause, which doesn't need mind or self or intention. Moral freedom is thus still left among things-in-themselves. Kant himself would have had difficulty placing randomness in his ontology, if he, like Hume, believed that chance violates determinism. Since chance is now part of the physics, it cannot be denied; but it also still remains a different matter from purposive freedom.      Kant's idea that space and time do not exist among things-in-themselves has been curiously affirmed by Relativity and quantum mechanics. In Relativity, time simply ceases to pass at the velocity of light: for photons that have travelled to us as part of the Cosmic Background Radiation, time has stood still for most of the history of the universe. On the other hand, quantum mechanics now posits ""non-locality,"" i.e. physical distances, and so the limitation of the velocity of light in Relativity, don't seem to exist. This means that although time may apply to the wave function, space may not. The full empirical reality of space is only found among discrete particles and objects.      This curious result is the consequence of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Paradox, which was intended by Einstein as a reductio ad absurdum of quantum mechanics. If, for instance, a positron and an election are both created from an energetic photon, the conservation of angular momentum requires that one be spinning one way, and the other the other. But the complementary spins are equally probable for each particle. Thus, in quantum mechanical terms, the wave functions of each particle divide without a discrete state being determined. The particles might then separate to even cosmological distances, but as soon as the spin of one particle is observed, the other particle must have the opposite spin, which means that the wave function has collapsed across those cosmological distances and caused the other particle to assume a predictable spin. If this occurs instantaneously, it would violate the limitation of the velocity of light in Special Relativity.      This has now been shown to actually occur on the basis of Bell's Theorem (from John Bell, 1928-1990), meaning that Quantum Mechanics does violate Special Relativity by allowing instantaneous interactions across even cosmological distances. However, once observed, processes must still obey Special Relativity and the limitations of spatial distance, creating the kind of duality described by Kant.

2356,"@Walter      ""The main point is whether we could call a being who wants a world of suffering ""good.""      Well, we can't. I do call Him Goodness Itself and other cool names, though.      A essencial part of this christian theodicy* is that God has a relation with morality totally diferent than our own, see for instance the fact that He can judge people, can kill people, can pester people until they want to do His thing(see Jonah) etc. The Book of Job lets this clear when God finally appears, for Job is trying to tread God as a equal the whole time, who needs to explain His actions to him and all that, and when He finally appears He makes very clear that Job treatment of Him as how we would do a normal person is completely ridiculous.      So the idea that God is good yes but on a more analogical than univocal way is not a clever apologetical invention but is there on the religions of the book since the beginning. It just sounds bizarre to me to see someone argue otherwise, specially when the ""the names Scripture uses to talk of God should not be understood as exactly what they mean in us"" is a thing since the church fathers.      This is important, for if God goodness is not exactly our own them His priorities can be diferent.

2156,"God's act of creation is God's very essence. That's why creation is a mistery we can not fully grasp. But I think we can show that this doctrine is coherent - or, at least, we can show that the arguments against this doctrine fail.      God has but one act of will - the act by which God wills himself. And God wills everything in the act of willing himself. This Divine Act is the same in every possible world. However, just as a point can be considered as the maximal or the minimum point of different parabolas, or the zero of many different lines, God's Will can be considered as the source of different worlds. His act of Will is really the same, but virtually distinct across possible worlds.      In fact, Saint Thomas says in the Summa contra Gentiles that sometimes a causa has a non-necessary relation with its effects. During the Middle Ages, of course, he was not aware of any probabilistic events - intrinsically probabilistic, I mean, like Quantum Mechanics. But his answer has this deep insight: a cause may produce its effects, not out of necessity, but randomly or because of a free choice.      The argument against Divine Simplicity shifts, at this point, towards intentional directedness. But here I think the argument presupposes an anthropomorphic conception of Divine Choice. We do not know anything about God's psychological life. We can not affirm nor deny the possibility of choosing different things in the same Divine Act.

2978,"Tadeo,      This is a great question that has been considered by great theologians like St. Augustine. The answer lies partly in God's relationship to time. God does not learn things that occur in history. He sees them all in one glance because he is outside time. He is not bound by it, but he is the cause of the existence of all that is bound by time. So in one glance He sees all things and He sees all things in relation to Himself. This pertains to Aristotle's thought thinking self. God knows all things as being caused by Himself. He sees in Himself the cause of all things and sees all things as caused by Him. This entails that all things (such as our prayers) can only be known in the full sense with reference to God who is the cause of our existence while praying and the cause of the very beings about which are prayers are concerned (e.g. our children or parents or friends, etc). This pertains also to His Will because, in seeing all things at once, He does not will things in acts that are temporally distinguished. In the unity of the Divine Will flowing out of the unity of Divine knowledge of all things created, all created things are willed by Him. This unity of the Divine will in the act of creation is an act of Divine Goodness. It is a sharing of HIs goodness with the created order. This is a Trinitarian act because Christ is the Word of God through whom He speaks the world into existence and the Spirit is the love of the Divine Will by which He wills the world from His Goodness.

3308,"Erick, Vatican I explains how those Councils condemning Pope Honorius for his failings must be interpreted. For the First Vatican Council cites the Fourth of Constantinople: ""For in the apostolic see the catholic religion has always been preserved unblemished"", which is hardly consistent with a heretical Pope not long prior to it. The Vatican Council defines: ""This gift of truth and never-failing faith was therefore divinely conferred on Peter and his successors in this see..."". The quality of never-failing faith (not exactly the same thing as speaking ex cathedra) has to be understood as pertaining to all Popes, including Honorius. The task of theologians is to interpret the case of Honorius with this understanding in mind, I would suggest, rather than have too many hangups about inflammatory language by oriental bishops that confounded (as we understand it today) formal heresy with aiding and abetting.      I think Fr. Amman's argument above does that well.

3282,"Tony, thank you for taking the time to read my posts. I am not clear on what issues you think I am fusing, but I THINK it is that i did not distinguish formal heresy from the ecclesiastical crime of heresy.      If I understand you correctly, I would say that my posts presume a case where a person does not consider his views to be heretical (as I would presume was the case with Honorius). I understand that a person could admit to knowing his view was heretical, and hold to it obstinately, and it be formal without ever being denounced by ecclesial authority.      So I accept that in principle the ecclesiastical crime of heresy and formal heresy are different. BUT, it seems to me that where a person does not take his view to be heretical, they basically conflate. The debate then would be whether a judgment by an authority is needed for us to discern whether or not they had sufficient basis to know the view was heretical. I THINK this might be where you and I disagree.      I would certainly acknowledge that one COULD be aware, in reality, that his view was heretical without such a judgment. But could anyone outside of the person himself sufficiently discern that? That is the question. My view would be that the only way we could know this definitively is if a judgment was made against the person, and he remained in his error.      And I think this then applies to the case of Honorius (BTW, elsewhere I noted Erick's point that there is the additional issue of no council having declared on monothelitism yet at the time of Honorius' letter, an additional wrinkle). I did state in places that I realize Feser was not addressing as such the distinction between formal and material heresy. I raise it to point out that in principle one could be anathematized on material heresy alone where that was not a clear understanding of this distinction, but such an anathema in retrospect is problematic. So that would prompt a further discussion as to given that the Church never later teaches anything not already implicitly supported by the defined deposit of faith, we must presume that those condemning Honorius would in fact be aware of something like material and formal heresy distinction, and still condemned him anyway.      My contention would be that we should not take their condemnation as proof that a pope could be guilty of teaching something sufficiently close to formal heresy, as I THINK you are suggesting. Rather, I would be inclined to do the reverse. Given that what the Church herself now implies (as I take it) about the relationship between formal heresy and the ecclesiastical crime of heresy (in cases where the person does not consider his view heretical), we can see that cases such as Honorius' prompted the need to develop the formal/material distinction more clearly. I think it is also fair to say that over time the Church has come to be procedurally more rigorous in understanding teachings to be DEFINITIVE only when formally pronounced in councils or ex catheda, even if we can contend that there can be infallible doctrine not so explicitly defined. But the ability to judge a person in relation to what they hold in such doctrines does in fact seem to differ when certain distinction and juridical procedures are more defined than they appear to have been in the time of Honorius' condemnation.",tony thank taking time read post clear issue think fusing think distinguish formal heresy ecclesiastical crime heresy understand correctly would say post presume case person consider view heretical would presume case honorius understand person could admit knowing view heretical hold obstinately formal without ever denounced ecclesial authority accept principle ecclesiastical crime heresy formal heresy different seems person take view heretical basically conflate debate would whether judgment authority needed u discern whether sufficient basis know view heretical think might disagree would certainly acknowledge one could aware reality view heretical without judgment could anyone outside person sufficiently discern question view would way could know definitively judgment made person remained error think applies case honorius btw elsewhere noted point additional issue council declared monothelitism yet time letter additional wrinkle state place realize feser addressing distinction formal material heresy raise point principle one could anathematized material heresy alone clear understanding distinction anathema retrospect problematic would prompt discussion given church never later teach anything already implicitly supported defined deposit faith must presume condemning honorius would fact aware something like material formal heresy distinction still condemned anyway contention would take condemnation proof pope could guilty teaching something sufficiently close formal heresy think suggesting rather would inclined reverse given church implies take relationship formal heresy ecclesiastical crime heresy case person consider view heretical see case prompted need develop formalmaterial distinction clearly think also fair say time church come procedurally rigorous understanding teaching definitive formally pronounced council ex catheda even contend infallible doctrine explicitly defined ability judge person relation hold doctrine fact seem differ certain distinction juridical procedure defined appear time condemnation,feser,3344,0

2195,"@ Walter Van den Acker,      ""Obviously God only had to obey your logic.""      That is nothing like what I said.      ""I don't avoid challenge,, but real challenge requires real arguments, and I don't see any from you.""      You do avoid challenge and you avoid mine because you can't answer it.      You would first have to understand the consequences of the bitwise XOR operation between a bitwise random sequence and an intelligible sequence. I will start with finite sequences and we can think of them as displayed on a computer screen under some standard protocol that displays sequences of bits as words on a computer screen, or at least it does if the sequence of bits are not such that what is displayed is nonsense. Now I can get a random sequence with 50/50 bits by a physical process. It could actually display as something intelligible but it is not likely.      Let us call this random sequence A. Let us call B an actually intelligible sequence. It consists of meaningful words converted into a sequence of bits so that they will display as the meaningful words when displayed under the standard protocol being used.      It can easily be shown that when a third sequence, C, is created by doing the operation A XOR B -> C, that C is as random as A and is as unlikely as A to display as anything meaningful.      Now, the beginning of a system:      It can also easily be shown that A, B, and C, together, have the property such that any two of them produce the third sequence when the bitwise XOR operation is performed on the other two. Thus:      A XOR B -> C,   B XOR C -> A, and   C XOR A -> B.      As stated above as easily demonstrated, if A is random, then so is C. But we began with a random A and then chose B to be intelligible, so if we XOR the two random sequences (""disordered"" is a better word here than ""random"", but for now I stick with ""random""), we get the intelligible sequence that we purposely chose. Now here is the crux of the beginning of the system:      The random sequence A that we began with cannot, by itself, give us the chosen sequence B. A is random after all. It could have been any similarly random sequence, so if any random sequence could be decoded into the chosen sequence, how could it be decoded into a different chosen sequence had a different one been chosen? If there was some process dependent upon the chosen sequence by which any random sequence could be decoded into the particular chosen sequence, then the chosen sequence would already have to be known before the correct process that works could be used. So the random sequence A cannot have, intrinsic to itself, the information thatispecifies the chosen sequence. Furthermore, since the second random sequence was produced using the XOR operation with the chosen sequence and the chosen sequence could have been _any_ intelligible sequence, we have that a second random sequence C exists for any initial random A and chosen B. For random A there exists a random C that gives B, the intelligible sequence, no matter what intelligible sequence Biwas chosen.      By just guessing at what C happens to be, A XOR C is most likely nonsense, but if it results in an intelligible B, it is very unlikely to be the pre-chosen B. It is in fact as likely as correctly guessing the pre-chosen B from all possible intelligible sequences (this is slightly simplified for clarity).      This is the beginning of a system based on simplicity that will show that God does not have to be ruled by the logic that you, Walter, futilely use to try to impose your own ideas as limits on God.

In that case, _G_ might be defined by symmetries of the population and/or symmetries of the probability space. In such a setting, we might want a weaker Pareto principle that supposes additionally that _f_ ( _x_ , _ω_ ) < _g_ ( _x_ , _ω_ ) for some _x_ and _all_ _ω_. With that weaker Pareto principle, the proof that the existence of a _G_ -invariant preference of the right sort on the distributions implies local finiteness of action does not work. However, I think we can still prove local finiteness of action in that case if the symmetries in _G_ act only on the population (i.e., for all _x_ and _ω_ there is an _y_ such that _g_ ( _x_ , _ω_ ) = ( _y_ , _ω_ )). In that case, given a subset _A_ of the population _Q_ , we define _A_ † to be the distribution that gives _w_ to all the persons in _A_ with certainty (i.e., everywhere on _Ω_ ) and gives _v_ to everyone else, and the rest of the proof should go through, but I haven’t checked the details.",note natural think x set people location inspired kenny easwaranhttpswwwgooglecomurlqhttpsaffwwwdropboxcomfsfdklfwslqlrtsfaggregationpdffrawdsadsntzusgaovvawnfkxsldlphyvx- lddt one also think set q × ω ω probability space q population f x ω represents value x get location ω case g might defined symmetry population andor symmetry probability space setting might want weaker pareto principle supposes additionally f x ω g x ω x ω weaker pareto principle proof existence g -invariant preference right sort distribution implies local finiteness action work however think still prove local finiteness action case symmetry g act population ie x ω g x ω ω case given subset population q define † distribution give w person certainty ie everywhere ω give v everyone else rest proof go checked detail,pruss,1407,1

1645,"@Michael @Talmid @AnonWCB      That was incredible, you are amazing guys. Thank you so much for the in-depth answers. That helped a lot.      I asked that because of the time I've been passing through life in the last 3 years. My life has been a lot miserably. So it's nice to know that - even though it's hard to imagine how in one act - God is listening to my prayers. But I won't lose my faith.      In case you guys were curious about that it has to do with things that happened before I meet Ed's blog. My life - my family - life has always been pretty harsh. And to worsen all that I have OCD. My grandmother on my father- side died of Alzheimer and I'm afraid that my father would develop that too. My mother lost her job due to an injustice that happened to her during the pandemic and all that bullshit.      But the worst thing that doesn't seem to go away is the depression and trauma that my OCD contributed to. I was very very influenced by Libet's ''experiment'' back then and unfortunately, I acknowledge a fella named Sam Harris with all that mysticism about 'no self' etc. (that seemed to follow from the experiment's conclusion), and since then that stuck in my head - not because I believed it - even though I had a weak spot for materialism and 'took it for granted' because you know ''science'' mentality that I was influenced to. The problem was (somehow still) the fact that I didn't even know how to defend myself from all that (i.e that the experiment methods were bogus, that the rest doesn't necessarily follow from it). And the implication with all of that in my life was the fact that if that is true, life is simply worse than it seems. There is just pain and suffering. What weighed more than one hundred pounds for me was the fact that I simply love my mom and my family and if there was no free will, no God, and we were somehow unreal because there was no self (nothing that lasts or abides)... I don't need to paint the rest of the picture to see how evil, atrocious, and how I felt and still feel because I have nightmares and traumas with that till nowadays.      In the midway path between that, I found Ed's blog and began to read it - even emailed him one time. And that gave me hope that there was a God after all and that those things could be false.      But even so, buddhist claims from Harris traumatized me a lot and due to my OCD, I still suffer from them till today. Deep there, I confess I'm really afraid that something evil like that is possibly true. Because it's an even worse version of materialism with all its adorns.

2948,"I agree that these two positions are distinct and should be kept apart for the purpose of recognizing whether either one is contrary to _what the Church teaches_. Von Balthasar's position is much less easy to attack as contrary, or as clearly and explicitly contrary.      But whether salvation for all it is something that we can ""reasonably"" hope for is not the same as whether it is clearly and explicitly contrary to what the Church teaches. Some teachings make it imprudent, unwise, or temerarious (rash) to propose, without being definitely opposed to Church teaching, because the Church teaching strongly **leans** in a certain direction without (yet) being _definitive_ about it. For example, the Holy Office stated over 100 years ago that it MAY NOT safely be taught that Christ in his human intellect did not have the knowledge of those in Beatitude during his period on Earth, nor even that the position be held as debatable or uncertain.      In addition to the (many) biblical passages that _at least point toward_ the result that some are damned, there are some passages whose import are (and have been taken traditionally as saying) that some are _in fact_ damned, rather than that some may be damned. And whether they have been ""traditionally"" taught so, versus ""Traditionally"" taught so, i.e. whether the weight of the apostolic and Fathers teachings' comes down definitively on one side of that, I hesitate to say, but then again perhaps _so should everyone else_.

1450,"(last one)      But at the same time, there is a problem with me I couldn't help but think that what if I got them all wrong? What if their arguments are plausible at all? I'm not a philosopher, just a normal guy. And I want to confess something: even though I do not think that something like that (buddhism) is plausible at all, I am afraid of the possibility that it could be because I am ignorant and my OCD does not let me go through this. It was a lot hard to write all these comments - since I am struggling with myself to even conclude a thought. There were a lot more - and a lot more detailed criticism - that I want to write but I simply can't (especially a topic at 4.5 that's the most important part of all it but I don't have the necessary strength and a point that I tried to make à-la Aristotelian retortion in the sense that they must presuppose permanence and can't get rid of it in making their arguments in the same way that Alex Rosenberg can't get rid of intentionality when trying to 'naturalize intentionality').      And for those of you who think: ""why buddhism bothers you that much?"" The answer should be self-evident by now (and for reasons that make simple materialism looks like a weekend at the beach): look at the consequences of all that. There would be no persons, no things, and in some way just suffering. Life would be just horrible. There would be illusions all around us. All persons would be substances per accident - and that's just awful and I can't believe that there are people who find this idea pleasing. And the other reason is OCD. Looks like nothing that I could present by myself is ever sufficient to disprove them. Looks like my arguments are never enough - and since I'm just illiterate in philosophy there is a wall I could never cross.      Unfortunately, I came across buddhism by chance when I was fixated on the experiment of Benjamin Libet on free will (at least his sense of ""free will"") and stumbled across the work of Sam Harris arguing that since there was no free will there is the illusion of the self. Since I have OCD things don't 'go out' of my head that easily (like in the case of normal people). Since the idea per se is insane I tried to understand why people think that it's plausible in the first place. And by their paradoxical 'reductio' way of arguing and the abuse of science that they always propose (bearing in mind that I didn't know that there is such a thing as A-T Meta at the time) that stuck in my head and only got worse through the years.      So, I appreciate it if someone could help me with it. Even though it's not apparent, I tried to put a lot of effort into solving it.

To understand the buddhist position I make an extreme amount of effort (due to how I felt every time I came in contact with it and due to the fact that I'm just a normal guy) and based myself on some works but most specifically: Jay L. Garfield ""engaging buddhism: why it matters to philosophy"" and Mark Siderits ""how things are: an introduction to buddhist metaphysics""      Things to notice about buddhism, in general, is the thesis that they subscribe to mereological nihilism, momentariness (nothing exists more than an instant), nominalism (or conceptualism depending on the 'school'), and what they call ""anti-substancehood"".      If someone is a philosopher (a true philosopher, not a continental one) I do recommend reading the Mark Siderits one since it is a defense of buddhist metaphysics positions in all its aspects (the book cover even says that it is ''buddhist philosophy for philosophers"", so let's commit the fallacy of authority here). So a literate philosopher (not some random guy like me) could see the full picture i.e how far can the arguments go in a necessary way and if they were to be coherent at all at the end of the day. Btw, Ed, I hope that you're reading this.      So, the major differences between their position and ours are that:      1 - they collapse the distinction of act and potency (e.g for something to exist is for it to ""keep producing"" its effects in some way continuously, they use the example of a sprout saying that if the sprout is permanent and not momentary it should keep producing its effect continuously).      2 - they take universals to be ""abstract"" and ""causally ineffective"". Their idea of causality resembles a lot a proto-humean one (like its some kind of idea of the mind conjoining things together).      3 - they do not even address the Aristotelian sense of substance at all and collapse its position with bare substrata. Since this is a ""serious charge"" I will quote a footnote from the Siderits book: ""I am here using “substance” in the Lockean sense of the “something know not what” that underlies and supports an object’s properties. This usage is common to both Aristotle and Nyāya."" (footnote 16, page 65 of the book I've mentioned above).

866,"@ Walter Van den Acker,      An intelligible verbal communication can exist on a computer as a sequence of 1's and 0's that is made intelligible through an operational protocol that casts it to the monitor as readable words. No computer can print an infinite sequence to the screen, but a finite subsequence can be read through a computer this way. There is an absolute difference between an infinite sequence and a finite sequence here. Now no matter what the intelligible communication, it must exist throughout the infinite bitwise random sequence as a subsequence, normally distributed (from Wikipedia ""Normal Number"" on an infinite sequence of ""coin tosses"" : ""If a number is normal, no finite combination of digits of a given length occurs more frequently than any other combination of the same length"").      Yet in searching for the specific intelligible verbal subsequence described earlier it is impossible to know, if it is not found, that the infinite sequence is biased - is not normal, for the search could encompass a length of the infinite sequence that just does not contain the verbal subsequence. For example the sequence 01 should appear in 25% of the 2 bit subsequences, but if the sequence consisting of a million 1's in a row is where you happen to look for 01, you will not find 01 normally distributed in the million 1's. Such lengths missing the verbal subsequence must also appear in the infinite sequence, and they must also be normally distributed if the infinite sequence is normal, which it must be if it is bitwise 50/50 random.      This model of simplicity contains all human imaginable worlds that can be verbally communicated and yet no matter how much of it is human examined (i.e., the examination must be finite), a verbally communicable description of the finite world might never be found. You might just always be looking in the wrong place.      This is similarly true of human verbal speech about anything.      God knows this idea. It is a Divine Idea. As a model or image of God it does not limit God but it shows how God cannot be limited.      I should stop now for your response, your objections, questions, or additions.

867,"And also: I have quite explicitly said in previous posts that if there is a problem here, it has to do with the God's intention/reasons for X being the same as God's intention/reasons for ~X. That is a different issue which is only tangentially related with divine creative freedom - the actual problem there is with the multiplicity of divine ideas. I can grant (as I have granted before) that there can be an objection from the fact that prima facie in DS God's ideas would all be the same, but there should be a multiplicity, etc. This is something that strikes us as being quite different from how us humans think (and by extension, intend things).      This is not the problem of ""how could God freely cause different things in different worlds without any intrinsic differences in God between worlds???"". I have been very clear and precise in my comments that it is *this* that I think is a bad objection which would also affect LFW for humans, not just God. And I have explained why.      So, using the terms in our latest posts: if we are to assume these ""Wills"" as you want, they would have to not determine the action. Someone would have both the ""Will-to-X"" and the ""Will-to-not-X"" and then be able to indeterministically cause either X or ~X in that case. So there would be no intrinsic difference in the subject required for him to cause X or cause ~X in that situation. The same as God.      What you CAN object is that, differently from us, under DS in God the ""Will- to-X"" would be the same as the ""Will-to-not-X"" and you could think that this is absurd. But then as I said this is a different objection - it's basically the issue of the multiplicity of divine ideas, only tangentially related to free choice (if one thinks ideas are required for choices). The issues of ""5 is different than 2!"" etc. I have talked about this in my last reply to Vincent. On this topic I'd just recommend Dolezal's model and how I think different facts can have the same truthmaker (similarly to how triangularity and trilaterality can have the same grounding).

The more I've tried to fight and understand things the more they stuck in my head. I could notice btw a lot of gaps and things that I think were wrong with that nefast metaphysics - but I'm incapable to fight on my own and understanding things (you know, philosophy is hard. The fear of misinterpreting them due to a possible fallacy by my part or that they got some ""magic argument"" that I don't know and could just flip my refutation, etc. ).      I tried to engage against those arguments from impermanence, they're ontology and etc. by applying the methods of retorsion that Ed taught in the first chapter of Scholastic's Meta. There are a lot of similarities or so I think between Heraclitus and the Buddhists - after all, they both can't live for more than a second. But due to all my trauma and the fact that I felt so uncomfortable just by reading and thinking about it (my symptoms goes from headache, sleepiness, and weakness to fever).

But by now the more I try to confront this I'm simply mentally incapable and it's been almost 3 years of living that way. I don't have much more forces. My only hope is that someday some professional philosopher as formidable, careful, and badass as Ed could discuss this thing pointing out not just how it's wrong but that it can't even be right, to begin with, so I can finally put all that pain to rest.

Here we have to make a distinction between something being logically possible and something that is actually the case. The scenario you describe is logically possible in the same way that it is logically possible that God could have made unicorns. However, framing it this way and then going on to say that we should hope for this is analagous to suggesting that we should hope for the existence of unicorns.      The question is not whether it is logically possible in the strict sense. The question is: what from reason or revelation has led you to think that this is in fact the case? After we have all listened to the crickets for a bit, we should be able to move on from this question. Instead we have to put up with folks bending their will to find any figure within the tradition who will agree with their foregone conclusions.      Their approach is not: what is the weight of Tradition on this question. Their question is: can I find anyone who agrees with me. Their question is not: how do I operate within the stream of Tradition making sense of all of Scripture in light of Tradition and especially in light of the greatest figures in the Tradition (doctors like St. Thomas, St. Augustine, etc.). Rather their approach is: how close can I get to affirming something as close to universalism as possible without actually committing myself to propositions that have been explicitly condemned. This is *NOT* a catholic approach to theology.      The problem, however, is even greater than what I have described. It is not that they have neither reason nor revelation supporting their position and they choose to believe it anyways. That would be irrational. However something more is occurring. They actually have both Scripture affirming that few will find eternal life and the greatest doctors of the Church understanding that passage in its very obvious sense and they reject this testimony or explain it away. Again, that is *not* a Catholic approach to theology.      And contrary to the calumnious suggestions otherwise, the concern of those who are speaking out against these trends is ""pastoral"". Those speaking against these trends (e.g. Ralph Martin in his book Will Many Be Saved? and Edward Feser and Fr. Rooney and the Popes who have repeatedly warned about indifferentism) are motivated precisely out of love for those drawn into indifference over sin because of these dangerous opinions. Hard to get people to suffer the embarrassment of a good confession if they think that everyone is going to heaven regardless. And those who say ""well it is possible that everyone is going to heaven"" easily move to: most people are in fact going to heaven for otherwise God would be cruel.

2218,"@RunDec      Given that, as I understand it, to qualify as a classical theist, a thinker has to, principally, adhere to divine simplicity, I readily concede that this is compatible with a necessitarian view, and that of many thinkers classified as such. This compatibility, however, obviously does not entail its truth. Fr. Davies seems to concern himself with rebutting the claim that divine simplicity entails it, and to achieve this he doesn’t need to positively prove the account he happens to think is the true classical theist account, namely, presumably that of St. Thomas. After all, it’s not like classical theism is a concrete comprehensive philosophical doctrine or “system” as opposed to a (contingently useful) classification abstracting from the all-important theoretical peculiarities.      Now, in light of your reference to pure act, I assumed that it is this account that you had in mind, and I submit that, I find, the way the pure act argument works is straightforward, really: agents act for an end, and where there is no necessary relation between the means and an end, there is no necessity. Because, on the one hand, God is pure act, something per se perfect, and is the only possible end for His acts, and creatures fail to contribute anything to His perfection, on the other, God cannot be said to will the creatures necessarily.

But it's important though that for buddhists things have no motion since motion would imply substances or something that survives. And that's where I collapse because I'm not so good in A-T meta to explain all the problems with the argument that Siderits sets out in the book. Unfortunately - but sincerely - I can only feel that something is very wrong (and I'm not proud of not pointing out what is it). But I can at least think that is by making seriously controversial claims like ""things produce their effects and them go out of existence"" that the argument supposedly has some weight. But even if that's so, it's not clear that that could not be interpreted as an ephemeral substance (the ones that Ed exemplifies when talking about when explaining prime matter in Scholastic's Meta) for example.      But one thing that puzzles me a lot about buddhism - without even mentioning their purported attempt to show that they are ""not eliminativists"" about persons, but that persons just are ""useful fictions"". Is how they square to the fact from impermanence of all phenomena with things like semantics, language, or words. After all, they wrote a book arguing that people do not exist (or exist just conventionally because nothing lasts for more than a moment) exactly in a language that exist (with modifications, of course) since the 5th century i.e English. And that's what makes me puto ('pissed') with it because the evidence against their position it seems to be everywhere but they never want to look at it. And to say that since all phenomena are impermanent, so language and semantics are just conventionally true but not ultimately true just raises the question of how it is even possible in principle for something that is impermanent and shouldn't last for more than a moment gives the impression of permanence in the first place? To put it simply how could impermanent and momentary things could even in principle brought up the illusion of permanence if they are impermanent? Because if they want to salvage their position they would necessarily argue that the idea of permanence in the conscience, memory, and objects from everyday life are just illusions.

1545," _Even in ordinary language, the term 'proselytism' does have a vaguely negative connotation these days, so it is fair enough that the Church has chosen to deploy it to denote negative ways of promoting the faith, while giving this clarifying definition in the 2007 document.   _      Fair enough. While giving the clarification. But then again: _Not_ fair enough absent the needed clarification, and certainly not when the clarification is being more or less actively undermined by other ambiguity.      And for particulars: one specific example used, of preaching for the ""gospel of prosperity"", I would argue is **not** a sound example. The pope argues that their interpretation of the gospel is in error, and their manner of persuading is unjust. As to the latter - maybe so, although I would want to see specifics to see what, precisely, is unjust. As to their erroneous interpretation - that is so, but (in many cases, though admittedly not in all) the preachers are _sincere_ in their misguided grasp of the gospel. So their error on this is in no way more damaging to the mere fact of their trying to persuade others, than is that of mainline Protestant churches, who also are in error in their interpretation of the gospels. The pope's singling out the mainline Protestants as being ""OK"", and the gospel of prosperity preachers being mean nasty ""proselytizers"" is - on this score - not consistent.      The real problem with the BAD kind of proselytism is that it uses as persuasive forces things that _should not_ be used so. It may use false premises. Or false logic. Or appeal to emotional ""motives"" that are not founded on reasonable bases. Or unreasonable threats of bad outcomes ""if you don't convert"". But mainline Protestants have used these tools also: e.g. they have used false premises in falsely characterizing the _Catholic_ teachings from which they depart. (E.G. ""Catholics worship Mary"".)      These kinds of tools are wrongly used in _Catholic_ hands, too, so it's not the _true proposition_ on account of which they are employed that is the problem with them, it is the manner in which they act on the hearer to cause belief.      Like with all the other times Francis has played funny games with the truth: it's not that his words cannot be understood - with added clarifications - that makes them fit well with Catholic teaching overall. It's that he persistently chooses to present so many of them in obscuring, confusing, problematic ways, and he rarely bothers to clarify later himself, leaving it to other organs of the Vatican to suggest clarifications, while he goes on blythely generating more confusing commentary. The issue with ""God intends a plurality of religions"" stuff is a perfect example: he went beyond appropriate bounds in a public document, his curia ""corrected"" the sense of the passage so as to mitigate the problem, and then later he again in signing yet another public document with the same sort of obscurantist language.      Francis has publicly ""justified"" his so-called ""carelessness"" in these confusing sayings / teachings, by _saying_ that he is careless. But from the fact that the errors and obscurantism all plays to one angle, it isn't truly an accidental kind of carelessness. And anyway, if a person knows he is careless in off-the-cuff remarks, (a) that does not excuse him from _not refraining_ from making such remarks where he could sow problems, and (b) it does not excuse him with respect to written documents published after (what should be) careful consideration.

It's certainly true that God sets up ""randomness"" to achieve His ends in ways above human understanding. The events leading to the crucifixion of Christ are an obvious example specifically identified in Scripture, for instance.      But in that case, the events aren't actually random in the relevant sense, but only _apparently_ random. But once we see the big picture, we realize they weren't really random after all.      If God orchestrated evolution to bring about humans, then it wouldn't actually be natural selection that did it. It would be a situation more analogous to human breeding, what Darwin called ""artificial selection,"" but far more elaborate.      When it comes to breeding, we don't say that natural selection isn't blind, but rather that *actual* selection is occurring. The same would apply here. Natural selection would arguably still be occurring as well (as it is in human-bred animals), but it would not be the explanation for why things turned out as they did.

831,"Hi Ed,      I respectfully put it to you that the Thomistic doctrine of Divine simplicity you're defending here has passed its use-by date, for the following reasons:      1\. It isn't taught by the Church, which merely affirms that God has “one essence, substance, or nature absolutely simple” (Lateran IV, 1215). There's nothing here about whether God has contingent thoughts, plans or intentions in his capacity as Creator of the cosmos, in addition to possessing a nature which is necessary.      2\. It's totally unscriptural. The Bible depicts God as explicitly declaring, ""My thoughts [plural] are not your thoughts"" (Isaiah 55:8), in a verse affirming Divine transcendence (which is the last place where one would expect anthropomorphic language, so I can only assume it's literal). The Psalmist adds: ""How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How vast is the sum of them!"" (Psalm 139:17). Thomists, on the other hand, believe that God does not have multiple thoughts; instead, He has only one thought, viz., His thought of Himself, and He knows creatures by knowing Himself.      3\. It's grounded in a philosophically dubious ontology: creatures are said to be compounds of essence and existence, while God alone is an Act of Pure and Infinite Existence, which is incapable of possessing any modifications or attributes (such as thoughts and intentions). However, the arguments for a real distinction between essence and existence in creatures prove no such thing: all they prove is that matter and form are distinct (which is why I can know what a Thylacine [or Tasmanian tiger] is, without knowing whether it currently exists or not: I don't know for sure if its form is still instantiated anywhere on Earth). What's more, the notion of Pure Existence is utterly vague: it is indefinite rather than infinite. Better to say, rather, that God is the Ultimate Yardstick of existence. He defines what it means for us to exist, for ""in him we live, and move, and have our being"" (Acts 17:28).      4\. Thomists also contend that God, the Author of nature, could have made a different world, or no world at all, without having any different mental acts, such as intentions. That's like an author saying, “I could have written a totally different story, or even no story at all, without there being any difference in my intentions.”      5\. Why is there a world? The Thomist’s answer is: “Because God.” But if there were a different world, or no world at all, the Thomist's reply would be the same: ""Because God."" I respectfully submit that any explanation which is elastic enough to account for BOTH the world’s occurrence AND its non- occurrence is not doing the work of an explanation at all. It's vacuous.      6\. Finally, if there's one thing Scripture is quite clear about, it is that God is a Father. And as the doctrine of the Trinity shows, even without creating anything, He'd still be one. That's a basic fact about God, and it shows He's personal all the way down.",hi ed respectfully put thomistic doctrine divine simplicity defending passed use-by date following reason taught church merely affirms god “ one essence substance nature absolutely simple ” lateran iv nothing whether god contingent thought plan intention capacity creator cosmos addition possessing nature necessary totally unscriptural bible depicts god explicitly declaring thought plural thought isaiah verse affirming divine transcendence last place one would expect anthropomorphic language assume literal psalmist add precious also thought god vast sum psalm thomists hand believe god multiple thought instead one thought viz thought know creature knowing grounded philosophically dubious ontology creature said compound essence existence god alone act pure infinite existence incapable possessing modification attribute thought intention however argument real distinction essence existence creature prove thing prove matter form distinct know thylacine tasmanian tiger without knowing whether currently exists know sure form still instantiated anywhere earth notion pure existence utterly vague indefinite rather infinite better say rather god ultimate yardstick existence defines mean u exist live move act thomists also contend god author nature could made different world world without different mental act intention like author saying “ could written totally different story even story without difference intention ” world answer “ god ” different world world reply would god respectfully submit explanation elastic enough account occurrence non- occurrence work explanation vacuous finally one thing scripture quite clear god father doctrine trinity show even without creating anything still one basic fact god show personal way,feser,2992,0

2621," _But he looks around and sees actually good people, people with special abilities and excellence, and he realizes how unworthy he is of Heaven,_      In addition to the replies above, I want to focus on this notion. First, ""special abilities"" **never was** any aspect of being ""qualified"" for heaven. Take, for example, St. Peter. If you examine his behavior in the Gospels and Acts, you find a guy - a mere fisherman - who constantly puts his foot in his mouth, who berates God, and who runs away from a friend in great need. Eventually, he did clean up his act, but - as with all the saints - he attributed this to **favors he was granted out of God's overflowing gifts** , not out of his own merit.      ""and excelllence"". Again the ONLY excellence that technically qualifies is the **love of God** by which you act rightly in all your acts, and this is (again) always due to God's beneficent favor, not our own merit. All we can claim is to have _remained in cooperation_ with said grace, rather than repudiating it. St. Francis said that greater good would be found in a man merely picking a piece of straw out of the road, if done with perfect love of God, than in a great many great sacrifices suffered with imperfect love.      What you are confusing in ""excellences"" is the acts of HEROIC virtues by which the Church _locates and confirms canonized_ saints, with the actual excellence needed, perfect love. But the life of a nun in a contemplative cloister, who spends her entire life _just FOLLOWING THE RULE_ with perfect charity, (and without any call by God to endure situations demanding heroic virtue), has just as much claim on being in heaven as some highly acclaimed saint who performed many wonders and miracles with love of God, or a saint who bore great visible sufferings for love of God. The Church never _expects_ to canonize all those who go to heaven: she uses the test of heroic virtue as an empirical source of _evidence for_ the required love of God, but she does not deny the same love might persist in many who do not demonstrate it VISIBLY in great events.      And if you die in the state of grace but highly imperfect in your love of God, your time in Purgatory will correct that, and you will get to heaven with perfect love of God - just like the acclaimed and cannonized saints.",look around see actually good people people special ability excellence realizes unworthy heaven addition reply want focus notion first special ability never aspect qualified heaven take example st peter examine behavior gospel act find guy - mere fisherman - constantly put foot mouth berates god run away friend great need eventually clean act - saint - attributed favor granted overflowing gift merit excelllence excellence technically qualifies love god act rightly act always due beneficent favor merit claim remained cooperation said grace rather repudiating st francis said greater good would found man merely picking piece straw road done perfect love god great many great sacrifice suffered imperfect love confusing excellence act heroic virtue church locates confirms canonized saint actual excellence needed perfect love life nun contemplative cloister spends entire life following rule perfect charity without call god endure situation demanding heroic virtue much claim heaven highly acclaimed saint performed many wonder miracle love god saint bore great visible suffering love god church never expects canonize go heaven us test heroic virtue empirical source evidence required love god deny love might persist many demonstrate visibly great event die state grace highly imperfect love god time purgatory correct get heaven perfect love god - like acclaimed cannonized saint,feser,2316,0

2185,"@ Walter Van den Acker,      ""Please take whatever time you need""      OK, here is a bit more:      I avoid using phrases or concepts like ""all possible worlds"" as confusing or ambiguous and easily giving rise to dispute that can never be resolved, for how can our human minds encompass all possibility, especially if we admit that God must know more about what is possible than we can.

It greatly simplifies discussion and simplicity is what we are looking for.      I make a further simplification by saying that our ideas about all imaginable worlds must be communicable to other ordinary people. If it can't be communicated there is not much use in having the idea. It won't get anywhere.      This entails a further restriction, and that is that the communication must be verbal - in words that other people can understand. This could be widened somewhat. For example, ideas could be communicated by images, non verbal sounds, moving imagery, with or without sound, etc. But I hope you do not object to my just restricting it to words alone, again for simplicity. I believe that whatever can be said about communication by words alone can be extended to these other forms of communication.

2248,"@Walter   An agent has a range of actions that can be actualized for some given scenario (which provides the common intelligibility for the range of these actions). Since the range considered in itself is indeterminate (and the scenario is indifferent towards any one such action) the agent particularizes out of that range to get an actual action. The particularization itself is sui generis and only exists with some volition itself.      To answer your question more directly, action A and action B are analogous to each other with respect to the scenario in question. If the scenario is for instance that one needs to survive, then the actions ""drink water"" and ""eat food"" can both be said to ensure survival, but in different ways. Since neither of these has commanding power until they are realized, the agent is really open to both.      As such, if you were somehow able to run simulations of this, you would see the agent sometimes ""drink water"", other times ""eat food"".      @RunDec   I think it does, though I will get to what I think is a more core issue that I think you are getting at.      Volitional causation is not univocal. Because it is not univocal, you can have different actions with no intrinsic difference across the agent (until after the action is done). Moreover, ""X"" and ""Y"" do not have any actual individual reality until actually caused.      You only get a mystery if you already assume X or Y are already actual in the relevant way and are univocally transmitted to the effect.",walter agent range action actualized given scenario provides common intelligibility range action since range considered indeterminate scenario indifferent towards one action agent particularizes range get actual action particularization sui generis exists volition answer question directly action action b analogous respect scenario question scenario instance one need survive action drink water eat food said ensure survival different way since neither commanding power realized agent really open somehow able run simulation would see agent sometimes drink water time eat food rundec think though get think core issue think getting volitional causation univocal univocal different action intrinsic difference across agent action done moreover x actual individual reality actually caused get mystery already assume x already actual relevant way univocally transmitted effect,feser,1510,0

What else could CRT be invoking with ""Critical"" in the very name but that tradition?      From the Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's page on ""Critical Theory"":      ""According to these theorists, a 'critical' theory may be distinguished from a 'traditional' theory according to a specific practical purpose: a theory is critical to the extent that it seeks human 'emancipation from slavery', acts as a 'liberating … influence', and works 'to create a world which satisfies the needs and powers of' human beings (Horkheimer 1972b [1992, 246]). Because such theories aim to explain and transform all the circumstances that enslave human beings, many 'critical theories in the broader sense have been developed. They have emerged in connection with the many social movements that identify varied dimensions of the domination of human beings in modern societies.      ...While Critical Theory is often thought of narrowly as referring to the Frankfurt School that begins with Horkheimer and Adorno and stretches to Marcuse and Habermas, any philosophical approach with similar practical aims could be called a 'critical theory,' including feminism, critical race theory, and some forms of post-colonial criticism.""

1013,"@Walter      Do i not? One of the classical responses a theist make to the problem of evil is to say ""there are certain goods that could only be gained in a world like our own"". Even platonists argue that.      Well, the christian does have the example of the saints, whose suffering and hardships make their lifes noble and interesting* not only to us but even to themselves. To a christian, suffering is supposed to be seen not as a crappy thing, but as a way of uniting with Christ and climbing the latter to being similar to Him.      Not only on they but on normal people, perhaps even on your case, you can see people who look at terrible times they had and see their better situation as enobled or even justified by the bad times. This even on totally secular contexts, not considering the beatific vision(who would turn everything acceptable to the receiver).      This actually seems probably a very alien thinking to a modern unbeliever, except that Nietzsche did get there, so read eventually the start of the City of God, the part that Dr. Feser is quoting, slowly and trying to see things like St. Augustine. Perhaps it help. Likely not, for it is quite a jump.      And remember: this is not a way to us to see this world as justified, but a way to trying to see how God could see things that way.

2994,"@Tanner   Your second DBH quote is bunk. Turn to the first option he attacks, and ask what it means for a potential to be “beyond” the divine nature. I think his second prong suggests he is using “beyond” to mean “distinct from”. For, to reach his conclusion, this internal, unrealized potency must mean something that truly is part of God, thus undermining several essential attributes.   If I’m interpreting him correctly, I can’t help but wonder, what’s the problem? It shouldn’t be that God is realizing what could be called an objective potency. I see three possibilities for how that might threaten God’s claims to divinity:   1\. It undermines his aseity   2\. It threatens his immutability   3\. It does away with his simplicity   But it’s far from clear that realizing an objective potency does any of those things. There’s no reason to suppose that making a choice involves any kind of change on the choosing agent’s part, for example.   And we can already see why divine aseity goes on unscathed. An “objective potency”, as I’ve dubbed it here, takes it for granted that the possible thing doesn’t actually exist. It’s merely a possibility, for something that isn’t self-existing.

Among the behaviors explained by the relevant causal laws are the use of convenient designators by such systems. So the reductive explanation of the intuitions behind the posit of substances does not illegitimately smuggle substances into the explanans.""      And this brings yet another problem with them: the handwaving appeal to ""sciences"". It's not hard to find these guys arguing that there are ""stone- wise arranged atoms"" or that natural selection somehow vindicates the idea of impermanence (Garfield appeals a lot more for these kinds of things, that's why I'm not using his work that much). But that does not seem right, because that turns your metaphysics hostage to the scientific findings - the same findings that may overthrow your own view.      But if we come to focus on other points like their appeal to nominalism, they suffer from the same problems that Ed emphasized in TLS and Scholastics meta. The points like how they can even communicate with themselves if there are no universals - or even worse if there are just ""momentary beings"". But I think that their denial of universals has some relation with their momentariness thesis. And that's what I can't even understand in the first place. How can someone think that something analogous to the Heraclitean position is right in the first place? It's illogical. And someone might even say that, correctly, that the ""buddhist logic"" is very different from ""Aristotelian logic"". Fair enough. But that doesn't explain why someone might think that something so absurd as ""impermanent beings"" (let alone mereological nihilism, nominalism) is plausible in the first place. To affirm that ""there are no pots that last longer than a moment"" and that ""there is just a series of ephemeral pots one after another"" is not to disprove permanence, but to evade the problem altogether.

It is possible to be guilty of teaching doctrinal error by implication, when the context demands that a certain truth needs to be explicitly affirmed and instead one not only fails to do so but speaks in an ambiguous way that gives the appearance of approving the error. And that is exactly what Honorius did. The Monothelite error was being put forward, and he not only did not clearly condemn it but _seemed_ to be saying that it could be accepted.

That is completely wrong, in that it would destroy the unity of an action and would lead to a vicious regress regarding volition. Rather ""choose x"" and ""x occurs"" is a simultaneous causal relationship of an action of a volitional agent.      A better description of LFW here (in its most bare bones form as self- generated action; deliberation is a type of it) is not so much in weighing scales, but something like picking a point on a circle: namely, insofar as the formula of a circle only provides an undifferentiated sea of possibles but no actual ones, I have to actualize some particular point, and prior to that actualization, the point is just a mere possible, not something with an individual actual reality; it cannot even be considered of itself a true individual reality apart from my actualization.      You could say that relies on a dubious notion of an infinity of options, but the basic idea does not change even for finite options. Suppose I have C = {X, Y}. C taken of itself is just an undifferentiated sea of possibles, to get X I would need C[0] while for Y I would need C[1]. That caused ""indexing"" is just what a self-determined action is. Since that ""indexing"" is not prior to the action but simultaneous with it, it is self-determined and free; nor is it some random ""coin flip"" because the 0ing and 1ing are not some earlier floating states (which would also generate a vicious regress as above) but coincident with the volition itself. In fact, it is more accurate to describe ""0ing"" and ""1ing"" as descriptions of self-determinations, not as ""things"".

3186,"@Laudator Temporis Acti      There is nothing about your objection that logically limits its application to matters of religion - if it were valid, it would remove the possibility of objective certainty in any field of knowledge, since any assertion we made would always require the implicit qualification, 'But since I am fallible, I could be wrong about this' (even about e.g. 2+2=4).      I'll mention in passing - the objection, thus taken to its logical conclusion, would therefore appear to be self-refuting, because the objector puts forward the objection itself as objectively certain truth (not qualifying it as 'merely probable').      But be that as it may, I will try to show that (whether or not its conclusion is self-refuting) the objection is a logical fallacy.      This is its basic structure:      It is possible for beliefs of mine to be false.   X is a belief of mine.   Therefore it is possible that X is false.      Consider the parallel argument:      It is possible for cats to be black.   Fluffy is a cat.   Therefore it is possible that Fluffy is black [even though I can see she is white].      The reason that these arguments fail is that I can be aware of more about Fluffy than the fact that she is a cat, and I can be aware of more about 'X' than the fact that it is a belief of mine. If all we knew about Fluffy was that she was a cat, then it would be reasonable to say that it was possible that she was black. And if all we knew about X was that it was a belief of my fallible self, then it would be reasonable to say that X was possibly false.      But in fact, I can know from the evidence of my senses that in Fluffy's case, the abstract possibility for cats to be black is not fulfilled in her particular case. And I can know from direct knowledge of conclusive logical or factual evidence in the particular case of X (e.g. 2+2=4), that the abstract general possibility of my beliefs being false is not fulfilled in the particular case of my belief X.      This is why the general fallibility that is ours as humans does not prove the impossibility of individuals reaching valid objective certainty in particular cases, where the individual is aware of sufficient evidence for the belief.      So there is no reason in principle why an individual, although fallible, might not discover sufficient evidence to ground a valid objective certainty (absolute certainty or reasonable moral certainty as the case may be) that e.g. '2+2=4', or 'The theory of relativity is true', or 'God has promised to protect from error a whole class of statements made by the pope in certain fairly well-defined circumstances'. One would need to examine the purported evidence in each case, but there is no reason in principle that it could not exist, despite our fallibility.

Everyone is free, then, to contradict me. I would only ask my readers for that initial goodwill without which there can be no understanding.' (It was understood by everyone as being written in his capacity 'as a private theologian'.)      The book had a certain impact around the world of Catholic thought, as he no doubt wished - partly caused by his pre-existing reputation as a theologian, but certainly added to by the simple fact that he was now pope. He wanted to 'teach' people, in a similar way to us wanting to 'teach' each other by posting on this blog - hopefully our motive is that we want to help one another on the path to truth. And he wanted to use his new platform as pope to reach a wider audience.      However, Benedict didn't want Catholics to consider themselves morally bound to accept what he said, just from the mere fact of who it was that said it. I don't think that this was particularly because he was tentative or uncertain about his statements in the book - maybe for some of them he was, others he wasn't. But rather, he wanted in this case to leave acceptance of what he was saying simply up to the free consideration of the individual. He didn't wish to 'bind' anyone.      So, he took off his 'pope' cap and put on his 'private theologian' cap, saying that his writing was solely an expression of his 'personal search for the face of the Lord' (despite presumably being motivated by wanting others to learn from his words and to be influenced by them).      Is that swapping of caps problematic on your view? I'm reading you (maybe) as saying or implying that the assertions of a pope in faith or morals cannot fail to be 'binding' on any Catholic to some extent, whether the pope likes it or not; or maybe that this is so, at least by default. That is (maybe unless the pope explicitly says otherwise, as with Benedict's book), Catholics should consider themselves morally bound to adhere (at least to some degree) to a pope's assertions in faith or morals, merely from the fact of who it is that is asserting them. This would be whether or not they are published in an official document, and whether or not they are promulgated to the whole Church: it is all 'teaching', and by a representative of Christ, and therefore magisterial.      So on this view, the official but private replies of Pope Honorius to Patriarch Sergius would be 'binding' to some extent on any Catholic who learnt of them and their contents.      And the plane interviews of Pope Francis would be to some small degree magisterial (if they concern faith or morals) - calling for our acceptance of his statements from the mere fact of who it is that is speaking and 'teaching'.

One of the indicators of this is, expressly, the Church's willingness to categorize someone as ""a heretic"" (and not just condemn their teaching) on the basis of not merely that their idea is erroneous, but that _they should have KNOWN better_ , and thus their holding such ideas is _morally_ faulty as well as intellectually faulty. Certainly, the fact that something had been already _taught universally by the Fathers_ was considered sufficient evidence of its bona fides, without either a council or a papal declaration, and indeed its unanimous affirmation by the Fathers _was USED by the Councils_ as the basis for their dogmatic definitions. But at the same time, there were many other teachings that were neither dogmatically defined, nor contested / disputed, that were simply _passed along_ from generation to generation as being ""what had been taught"" and everybody assented to them and nobody got worked up about whether they were held definitively and irreformably or just, you know, the ordinary teachings of the Church.

1320,"Quoting Hart:    _For God, deliberative liberty – any “could have been otherwise,” any arbitrary decision among opposed possibilities – would be an impossible defect of his freedom._   And:    _A God who merely chooses to create – as one equally possible exercise of deliberative will among others – is either actualizing a potential beyond his nature... or he is actualizing some otherwise unrealized potential within himself...._      I notice that Hart is essentially stating the Modal Collapse objection in these passages, which purports to find a dilemma according to which either creation must be as actual as God Himself, or His act of creation must be utterly arbitrary, random, and unintended on His part.      Rather than rejecting this dilemma as classical theists do, or taking it as an argument against the Unmoved Mover as atheistic proponents of the argument do, Hart affirms the first leg of the dilemma, collapsing creation into necessity and thus crossing into pantheism. He wants to arbitrarily take this only halfway, though, rather than following that line of logic to its full implication that change and multiplicity are illusions, and only Being Itself exists, a la Parmenides.      As Ed points out, to assume that creation must be as necessary as God in order to be caused by God ignores the distinction between active potency and passive potency. And that distinction isn't some special pleading, but rather a direct implication of the Unmoved Mover argument.      I would argue that the idea that creation must be either necessary or random also evinces a tendency especially common among moderns to try to collapse free will (the choices of rational agents with will and intellect) into either blind law-like automation or random chance, the two broad categories of mindless, mechanistic causation allowed by the ""scientific"" reductionist- mechanistic worldview. _Even though we experience it all the time in our own choices_ , they simply have a difficult time understanding that a free rational agent can cause things such that they are not necessitated by the agent's nature but are still grounded in it and non-random, and that this does not reduce to something less.",quoting hart god deliberative liberty – “ could otherwise ” arbitrary decision among opposed possibility – would impossible defect freedom god merely chooses create – one equally possible exercise deliberative among others – either actualizing potential beyond nature actualizing otherwise unrealized potential within notice hart essentially stating modal collapse objection passage purport find dilemma according either creation must actual god act creation must utterly arbitrary random unintended part rather rejecting dilemma classical theist taking argument unmoved mover atheistic proponent argument hart affirms first leg dilemma collapsing creation necessity thus crossing pantheism want arbitrarily take halfway though rather following line logic full implication change multiplicity illusion exists la parmenides ed point assume creation must necessary god order caused god ignores distinction active potency passive potency distinction special pleading rather direct implication unmoved mover argument would argue idea creation must either necessary random also evinces tendency especially common among modern try collapse free choice rational agent intellect either blind law-like automation random chance two broad category mindless mechanistic causation allowed scientific reductionist- mechanistic worldview even though experience time choice simply difficult time understanding free rational agent cause thing necessitated nature still grounded non-random reduce something le,feser,2200,0

2911,"This is a new idea that I had not heard of. And I admit that there's room for more understanding, but I would hazard this:      By ""living uterus donation"" do you mean Jane, who is healthy, giving over her uterus to Sally, whose uterus is damaged and cannot be healed, so that Sally can conceive a and bear a child?      If we assume that Jane is not offering her uterus _in order to avoid conceiving_ , the contraceptive aspect of the perverted faculty argument is not applicable. If, for example, Jane is single and expects to stay that way, and stably has not been engaging in sexual relations, she can be presumed not to enter into this for contraceptive reasons. She is not perverting her faculty of reproduction.      Nor is Sally perverting her faculty of reproduction: her faculty is being impeded by a damaged organ, which (apparently) can be worked around by medical means. So far as ""faculty"" arguments go, this is morally licit.      The real weight of the moral difficulty is in Jane effectively maiming herself: it is not _generally_ reasonable to take away a functioning major body part. However, the ""generally"" I added there does imply reservations on how far that applies: it is (by most ethicists) considered moral for a person to donate one of his 2 kidneys to another whose kidneys have failed. This is even laudable: the donor can (for the most part) ""get by"" on one kidney - though they will live a life of increased risk, because they no longer have a ""back-up"" kidney to take over if one is not functioning.      Arguably, Jane can use the same approach to justify donating her uterus to a woman whose own uterus is damaged: if Jane isn't going to ""use it"", she can offer its use to another. However, I see potential quagmires here, and I don't think it's that simple. On the one hand, if Jane is single, on what basis is she _certain_ she will not marry? If she is married, on what basis is she able to definitively decide she won't be ""needing"" that uterus any more? (On the other hand, what if Jane has taken permanent vows of celibacy in a monastic order, and knows she will not be using her reproductive faculties for reproduction?)      Secondly, the reproductive organs are highly inter-related, and it is absolutely _not_ a given that ""because Jane won't be using the organs for reproduction"" doesn't altogether imply the organs have no health function in the body. This is manifestly true of the ovaries, and hormonal activity that regulates tons of other body functions than JUST reproduction. I don't have any knowledge of whether the uterus, like the ovaries, is involved in other activities for health. I suspect that (a) the medical system claims those health risks are minimal, and (b) that they _may_ be oversimplifying the case in saying so, but I don't actually know.      As to being involved in ""the system"": since there seems (to me, indicated above) that there is a plausible argument that the underlying donative action is morally licit _in some cases_ , it comes down to a prudential judgment whether the overall activity is _nearly always_ a donation precisely because Jane wants to avoid the possibility of pregnancy, i.e. whether working for it is supporting something that almost always is being done immorally, or not.

2393," _If a human on this Earth can choose a lesser good instead of a greater good, that is a imperfection._      A lamb which is killed by a lion for food is an imperfect lamb, also.      As I already indicated, the state of a man on Earth able to sin _is indeed_ less complete and less perfect than his state in heaven, when he is no longer able to sin, (though he has MORE, not less, freedom). This lesser sort of perfection may be called ""imperfection"" in one sense, or it may be called a ""more limited"" condition that is _proper to one still in this life_ : Either way, one must keep the _sense_ being used clear. Hence, one cannot employ the position that our ""being able to sin"" represents an ""imperfection"" and conclude that this contradicts Genesis saying that when God made the world, it was ""good"" because man able to sin is ""not good"". That doesn't follow. A lamb is able to die, and that's a lack of divine perfection (for God cannot die), but it's a kind of ""im""perfection that is more properly understood as a _lesser kind_ of perfection. And God intended a universe filled with beings which are imperfect compared to Him, because it is impossible for Him to have created beings that are uncreated perfection. He also intended a universe with men who were capable of sin who then could achieve later the condition of the Beatific Vision and no longer able to sin, by way of meritorious acts of love of God made even IN the condition of able to sin.      You just want to call a universe wherein even one being is capable of failing to reach its end as ""good"".

But this is very vague to me. A being that is so perfectly good that heis just naturally (necessarily) making good things does not strike me as absurd, and the good things it makes would still be dependent upon him - and not he dependent upon them. The good things just follows as a necessary consequence from the perfectly good being, because that's what a perfectly good being is: it makes good things.      Again, it seems intelligible to me, and compatible with what Leibniz thought; Pseudo-Dionysius; the Neoplatonists; and so on. Personally I do not know that it should be rejected. What you said, again, strikes me as vague. The point remains that it's a controversial issue that requires a lot of argument, instead of just mentioning that God is pure actuality.

No, because we can understand Clement as meaning, not that God could do evil instead of good, but rather that he could refrain from acting at all rather than doing some good action.) Bradshaw also notes that Basil the Great rejects the idea that God creates “without choice, as the body is the cause of shadow and light the cause of brightness” (where he obviously takes these effects of the body and of light to be necessitated by them); and that Gregory of Nyssa holds that God created “ _not by any necessity_ … but because it was fitting.”",father also understand divine freedom way rule necessitated david bradshaw noteshttpsafkimelfileswordpresscomdivine-freedom-in-greek- fatherspdf clement alexandria say “ god good necessity choice ” conflict christian doctrine god positively evil understand clement meaning god could evil instead good rather could refrain acting rather good action bradshaw also note basil great reject idea god creates “ without choice body cause shadow light cause brightness ” obviously take effect body light necessitated gregory nyssa hold god created “ necessity … fitting ”,feser,934,0

2839,"'Levels of actuality' just seems to be verbiage for saying 'actualities potential to actualities'. Potentiality is not some random thing that Aristotelians posit; it indicates the fact that in change things that stay the same have to be capable of things that don't stay the same. If you have that, the capability is what people are calling potentiality, regardless of what words are used for it.      Thus your real argument just seems to be a rejection of prime matter as being identified with passive potentiality. Prime matter is a conclusion arising from two lines of argument, (1) no infinite regress in material causes, and (2) something must be the subject of change in substantial change. Both of these arguments still go through on your account: there are first material causes (your 'ultimate physical forms') which remain the same in substantial change. You just are arguing that prime matter consists entirely of immaterial forms (= actualities without material causes) that are eternal and unchanging (because otherwise they would require a subject of change).",level seems verbiage saying actuality potential potentiality random thing aristotelian posit indicates fact change thing stay capable thing stay capability people calling potentiality regardless word used thus real argument seems rejection prime matter identified passive potentiality prime matter conclusion arising two line argument infinite regress material cause something must subject change substantial change argument still go account first material cause ultimate physical remain substantial change arguing prime matter consists entirely immaterial form actuality without material cause eternal unchanging otherwise would require subject change,feser,1074,0

1441,"Right: it is Good's delight to spread good, not solely when and because it is ""owed"", but even where good is not owed. Thus, God's act of creation is spreading good where no good is owed - no thing _deserves_ to be granted existence, so for every thing, its existence is a gift to it.      And just as a good person can give goods to others where they are not owed, out of kindness, generosity, or mercy: so also a person can _relieve debt_ as a kind of gift to the person who owes. To show this more easily: if John owes me $100, and Bill kindly pays John's debt to me, I am paid off, and John no longer owes me. If Bill does this as a gift, nobody is HURT and my debt is satisfied.      Similarly, if I decide to ""pay off"" John's debt to me by considering it paid, I make a gift to John like Bill does above. Gifts are not **contrary** to justice, they are BESIDE it. It's just that I am both the giver and the one whose receivable is ""paid off"" by my gift.      For moral wrongs, we cannot forgive the part of the wrong that lies in the _sin against God_ , because that is a debt owed toward God, not us. But we can forgive the part that is owed to us.      Broadly speaking, it may be either prudent or imprudent to easily forgive some debts against us: too easily forgiving money debts could cause some people to become spendthrifts and wastrels. Similarly, too readily forgiving _offenses_ against us might have a similar result. But aside from that measure of prudence, Christ tells us to be willing to forgive any and all offenses against ourselves, and indeed the examples of both Christ and the saints shows them forgiving persecutors right in the midst of those acts of persecution - where clearly no remorse exists.      Perhaps someone can clarify distinctions about granting forgiveness of the _offense_ (qua guilt) while not relieving the debt of some kind of restitution?

817,"""one would have to show that there is something either internal to God’s nature or external to him that compels him to create. But given that the divine nature is as classical theists, on independent grounds, argue it to be (pure actuality, perfect, omnipotent, etc.) there can be no need in God for anything distinct from him, so that nothing in his nature can compel him to create. And since, the classical theist also argues (and again on independent grounds) there is nothing apart from God that God did not create, there can be nothing distinct from him that compels him to create""      I don't see how that works.      1- if it's being argued that the act is free simply because it isn't being compelled by anything external to God, nevertheless it could still be compelled by God's nature - that is, what is internal to God, not external. If this is free, it is not *libertarian* free however, and entails that creation is necessary: necessitated by God's nature;      2- if it is argued that there is nothing internal to God that could compel him, because he is pure actuality, it's not clear that the argument works. For all we know, an internal necessity need not be construed as some kind of ""lack"", in the sense that ""humans need food to survive"". God didn't need creation to not be lonely or any other nonsense. But it could be a ""need"" in the sense of a necessary manifestation of the divine nature/goodness.

2867,"I've been reading through the complete works of C. S. Lewis for the past 7-8 months. (Reading through his works by genre). When I got to his non-fiction ""popular works"" (such as Mere Christianity, Miracles, etc.), I was surprised that his descriptions of God sound similar to the Classical Theist understanding of God. (At least in some cases). Below are a few quotes from Lewis's books (possibly) showing this.      For each quote, the name of the book (and chapter) comes first.      In this first quote when Lewis uses the word ""Dualism"" he means ""Cosmic Dualism"" (the belief in 2 equal opposite powers that control the universe, one good and the other evil), not ""Substance Dualism"". In this article he's responding to C. E. M. Joad, a British philosopher who was arguing in favor of Cosmic Dualism. (Lewis wrote this essay while WWII was happening).      (God in the Dock, Part 1, Chapter 1 ""Evil and God"")   (Quote)   ""We are left then to choose between monotheism and dualism—between a single, good, almighty source of being, and two equal, uncreated, antagonistic Powers, one good and the other bad. Dr. Joad suggests that the latter view stands to gain from the ‘new urgency’ of the fact of evil. But what new urgency? Evil may seem more urgent to us than it did to the Victorian philosophers—favoured members of the happiest class in the happiest country in the world at the world’s happiest period. But it is no more urgent for us than for the great majority of monotheists all down the ages. The classic expositions of the doctrine that the world’s miseries are compatible with its creation and guidance by a wholly good Being come from Boethius waiting in prison to be beaten to death and from St Augustine meditating on the sack of Rome. The present state of the world is normal; it was the last century that was the abnormality.   This drives us to ask why so many generations rejected Dualism. Not, assuredly, because they were unfamiliar with suffering; and not because its obvious prima facie plausibility escaped them. It is more likely that they saw its two fatal difficulties, the one metaphysical, and the other moral.   The metaphysical difficulty is this. The two Powers, the good and the evil, do not explain each other. Neither Ormuzd nor Ahriman can claim to be the Ultimate. More ultimate than either of them is the inexplicable fact of their being there together. Neither of them chose this tête-à-tête. Each of them, therefore, is conditioned—finds himself willy-nilly in a situation; and either that situation itself, or some unknown force which produced that situation, is the real Ultimate. Dualism has not yet reached the ground of being. You cannot accept two conditioned and mutually independent beings as the self-grounded, self-comprehending Absolute. On the level of picture-thinking this difficulty is symbolised by our inability to think of Ormuzd and Ahriman without smuggling in the idea of a common space in which they can be together and thus confessing that we are not yet dealing with the source of the universe but only with two members contained in it.

I have to say that this statement is anachronistic. The term ""ex cathedra"" dates from the Middle Ages, and the modern doctrine of papal infallibility was first proposed by bishop Guido Terreni in 1332. To be sure, the formula of Hormisdas (519) declares that ""in the Apostolic See the Catholic religion has always been kept unsullied,"" but (a) it was written before Honorius became Pope, (b) it refers to the Apostolic See, not the Roman Pope, and (c) it says nothing about there being different categories of papal pronouncements (reformable and irreformable).      You also suggest that in the case of a future Pope who, while not speaking ex cathedra, nevertheless teaches error, the Church ""will come to judge harshly any pope who fomented such a crisis."" I'm not so sure. The reason why the third ecumenical council of Constantinople (680-681) was able to condemn Pope Honorius was precisely because its bishops had never been handpicked by him, whereas today, all bishops in the Latin Church are appointed by the Pope, and typically, most of the Cardinals who will elect the next Pope were handpicked by the current one. Thus it appears extremely unlikely that the bishops, speaking in unison, will judge any Pope harshly.

""Endosymbiosis is in my opinion a very powerful argument in favor of A-Thomism and against mechanistic evolution""      I like your point. It's well elaborated! You worked really well on the concepts of prime matter and the potentiality 'hidden' in it.      And btw, I want to thank you for your attention so far. You too @Tom.      I'm sorry if the topic/questions that I put on the table were repetitive or lame. Here in Brazil none of my friends really like to talk about that and don't care that much and I can say the same thing about our philosophers - they're a bunch of commies and half-baked intellectuals when it comes to anything that detours from politics that they ''know a lot''. In short, I don't have anyone to talk about that kind of thing. There are a lot of other questions that I can't even find materials to work with (all I have is some of Ed's books and the articles that David Oderberg gives for free on his website, and still there are a lot of things that I just can't understand right because it's hard to grasp). So I just want to say that I appreciate a lot of you guys time and effort - that means a lot to me.      The topic of natural selection and evolution generally opens up a lot of other questions - questions that mere biologists, say, can't answer in principle. The examples that I brought up about counting cells as individuals it's something that was really puzzling me. Of course, as I said I think that's insane. If cells we're conjoined to survive in the first place why do a lot of them have to die every day for the sake of others if the 'plan' was just for the single cell to survive in the first place? Why do we have apoptosis and the like? Or worse, like I said some comments ago replying to Tom, why do the 'true individuals' (the cells) come to form up 'the illusion' of a single individual? It means that the dog we see every day that 'seems' to rely on and works in unity with his own parts as a single thing to chase down the bikers across the street is just an aggregate of individual cells. That's not just disturbing I think that it's evil to think something like that.      As you guys can see I'm not a pro in biology. That's why I rely so much on the ''armchair'' philosophy. I can see that it is problematic to say that cells are individuals but I don't have a 'biological argument' (whatever that means) to affirm that. But the point is what is the motivation behind that 'science guys' to affirm something bizarre as that? That's something we should repeal because a lot of people just buy these ideas without even thinking about it.",hey uncommon hope trip went well endosymbiosis opinion powerful argument favor a-thomism mechanistic evolution like point well elaborated worked really well concept prime matter potentiality hidden btw want thank attention far tom sorry topicquestions put table repetitive lame brazil none friend really like talk care much say thing philosopher - bunch commie half-baked intellectual come anything detour politics know short anyone talk kind thing lot question even find material work book article david oderberg give free website still lot thing understand right hard grasp want say appreciate lot guy time effort - mean lot topic natural selection evolution generally open lot question - question mere biologist say answer principle example brought counting cell individual something really puzzling course said think insane cell conjoined survive first place lot die every day sake others plan single cell survive first place apoptosis like worse like said comment ago replying tom true cell come form single individual mean dog see every day seems rely work unity part single thing chase bikers across street aggregate individual cell disturbing think evil think something like guy see pro biology rely much armchair philosophy see problematic say cell individual biological whatever mean affirm point motivation behind science affirm something bizarre something repeal lot people buy idea without even thinking,feser,2653,0
776,"Now, I am citing works in the Scholastic tradition to reflect the point of view from which I approach these matters, but on this particular issue I don’t think Wuellner’s and Carlson’s account differs in any relevant way from what your average non-Scholastic philosopher or scientist would say. The idea is, first, that a hypothesis is a tentative explanation of some empirical event that will occur _under certain conditions_. Hence, suppose some effect _E_ occurs under certain conditions of type _T_. We might hypothesize that a cause of type _C_ is responsible, and then go on to test this by bringing about an instance of _C_ under conditions of type _T_ and seeing whether an instance of _E_ follows. If it does not, we might form some new hypothesis, to the effect that it is another sort of cause (of type _D_ , say) that is responsible. But even if our prediction is confirmed, it is possible in principle that it is nevertheless not really _C_ that is producing _E_ , but some other causal factor that is merely correlated with _C_. So we’d need to do further testing to rule that possibility out. And in any event, if there really is some causal connection between _C_ and _E_ , only such empirical investigation is going to reveal it, because the causal relationship between them, even if real, is going to be _contingent_. Again, it will be _possible_ that something other than _C_ is the cause, so that the most that further testing can do is render this supposition _improbable_ (even if, perhaps, _highly_ improbable).",citing work scholastic tradition reflect point view approach matter particular issue think account differs relevant way average non-scholastic philosopher scientist would say idea first hypothesis tentative explanation empirical event occur certain condition hence suppose effect e occurs certain condition type might hypothesize cause type c responsible go test bringing instance c condition type seeing whether instance e follows might form new hypothesis effect another sort cause type say responsible even prediction confirmed possible principle nevertheless really c producing e causal factor merely correlated c need testing rule possibility event really causal connection c e empirical investigation going reveal causal relationship even real going contingent possible something c cause testing render supposition improbable even perhaps highly improbable,feser,1534,0

2920,"I'd like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Harry J. Gensler, who   [passed away](https://www.jesuitsmidwest.org/memoriam/gensler-harry-j-father/) earlier this year.      His books on Logic and Ethics are popular and are distinguished by their clarity and conciseness. I particular admire his _Introduction to Logic_ for its breadth of topics and accompanying software, although long time readers of this blog may remember a series of posts titled _On some alleged quantifier shift fallacies_ , in which Prof. Feser criticizes Gensler's interpretation of arguments made by Aristotle, Aquinas, and Locke.

Gensler finds Aquinas' ""Five Ways"" and other classical theist arguments wanting, although he doesn't elaborate much on why. A theme of the book is that there are ""many paths to God"", with one of these being science, which Gensler argues is increasingly friendly to religion (at least, the Abrahamic religions).

Now this leaves me with some questions. Now keep in mind that if you try to communicate back, I will not understand as I have not seen your Truman show. However, since you have seen mine, I know that you will understand the points I am driving at by my questions. This will give you some food for thought while you are in your cage.      The first question is: could you tell us what study has identified the three movements of the intellect (understanding, judgement, syllogism) with particular elements on the periodic table? And, which elements are associated with which movement? And if not elements, perhaps compounds? If so, which compounds are associated with which movements? And is it that the compound has to be located in the person, or in the brain, or in a particular place in the brain at a particular time to have a particular thought? And if the compound present in one person when they think that thought, how do you know that this compound is *causing* the thought? Or are you identifying it with the thought? And how do you know it does not merely correspond with the thought rather than causing it or being identified with it? And if it were causing the thought or identified with it in *this person* how do you know that the same occurs in all people? If a certain element, compound, or process is associated with a thought in person A, how do you know that this occurs in all people in the world? And if it does not occur with all people in the world, how can you reduce understanding of some concept or some judgement with a particular element, compound or process?      These are just a few questions for you to chem on in your cage. Given how important evidence is to you, I am sure that you have evidential answers to all of these questions. If not, that would again show you to be a complete hypocrite and from your posts and our interaction, I know that this cannot be so....      Or perhaps you would tell us that you know none of the answers to these questions and that we just need to trust you that you are correct anyways. Well, given your omniscience about the upbringing of everyone on here that you interact with, that makes all the sense in the world. Just like you can know about everyone you interact with and they can't know about you, so you can require evidence of others but don't have to give it yourself.

Also for clarity's sake, I DO NOT believe that Hell is empty, and I do accept the weight of Tradition.      However, so far as I am aware (and this is of course limited - I have not read most of the Fathers & Doctors), there is no specific biblical passage that tells us in certain and definitive terms that THERE ARE some in Hell. It is, therefore, (so far as I know), remotely, vaguely possible to suggest that the biblical passages that point toward Hell are all to be understood as contingent: e.g. contingent on the sinner(s) not repenting.      _More than this, the scenario is *not possible* given the fact that Christ has revealed to us than many will in fact follow the path to destruction._      For all those huge numbers on the road to destruction, they will REACH destruction...if they do not repent. Suppose that **every single** person on Earth (other than Christ and Mary) will be on that road at some point in their lives, and so that road is very, very wide, and heavily populated. But we also know that SOME who are on that road turn around and head the other way - they repent.      Therefore, not everyone who is on the road to destruction _reaches_ destruction. What if 90% who are on the road right now, repent: the heavy population of the road right now tells us nothing about the ratio of those who end up in hell. What if it's 99%? What if it's 100% who repent?      Christ will, at the end of time, judge all people. Those who are judged to be goats will go off to final perdition. What if the class of ""the goats"" happens to have no members - an empty set? The _class_ is still a valid concept, because of the contingent possibility that some might not have repented.      I repeat: I don't think this what the weight of Tradition is pointing toward. I think that Christ **repeatedly** pointed out the dangers of Hell because there ARE people going to Hell.

There is _guilt by association_ , in which one attributes view X to a person who believes Y simply because other people who believe Y have been associated with X. There is the _abusive ad hominem_ , which involves simply flinging a pejorative label at a person (“racist,” “fascist,” “communist,” etc.) as if this sufficed to rebut his claim or argument. And there is what seems to compete with the circumstantial _ad hominem_ for the status of most popular fallacy on social media – the _tu quoque_ , which involves accusing someone of hypocrisy and supposing that one has thereby refuted his claim or argument.",failing intellect intellect insofar way dealing others typically involves committing several logical fallacy example circumstantial ad hominem fallacy pretending refute someone say claiming identify suspect motive part fallacy poisoning well involves casting aspersion character rather addressing claim argument guilt association one attribute view x person belief simply people believe associated x abusive ad hominem involves simply flinging pejorative label person “ racist ” “ fascist ” “ communist ” etc sufficed rebut claim argument seems compete circumstantial ad hominem status popular fallacy social medium – tu quoque involves accusing someone hypocrisy supposing one thereby refuted claim argument,feser,1111,0

1370,"""For God, there is no real past, present, or future, to God all is Now. God can directly experience every part of that Big Now. Difficuly one is if there is no real past, there can be no before, now, afterwards.""      The first sentence is not how a classical Theist would make the sort of assertion you are trying to make. If you are going to engage in dialogue where anyone at all takes you seriously, you are going to have to make more effort understanding the positions you appear hell bent on rejecting. Perhaps if you at least understand them correctly, that spark within you that cares about understanding rather than pretending might be fanned into a flame.      To say is correctly, you would say that God is not bound by time. That is a correct way to state the initial premise in an argument that you are set on criticizing. Now this requires an understanding of time and time's relation to matter, if you are going to actually understand a classical theist on this point.      In your third sentence quoted above you move from talking about God being outside time to simply making the assertion that this entails that there is not past, present, or future. Here you move from the assertion that since God is outside time, everyone and everything must be outside time. Well once it is framed that way (and this is an accurate way to frame the issue based on St. Augustine and St. Thomas' understanding of the relationship between time and matter--again more below--and God's relationship to time and matter), it becomes clear that what you are saying is sheer nonsense. So if you are going to frame a critique of classical theism, you are going to have to offer something beyond a sophmoric and blundering misinterpretation and misrepresentation of the premises of the classical theists argument.      Regarding the relationship between time and matter, Philo and St. Augustine held that these are interdependent and this is confirmed by modern physics (See Barr's Modern Physics and Ancient Faith). We are subject to the limits associated with time because we are corporeal beings and there is interrelationship between time and matter. After all, we measure time with respect to the movement of matter (e.g. the rotation of the earth around the sun). So the argument requires a deeper understanding and exposition of their understanding of time in order to get their argument right in the first place.      You have not taken the time to understand all of this which is why there is no one here that is impressed with what you have to say on this matter. If you wish to have your arguments taken seriously, why don't you first make a serious effort to consider the arguments of figures like St. Augustine and St. Thomas? This of course requires that you actually make a good faith effort to understand them on their terms. Now this would also require a smidge of humility in recognizing that they have something to teach you and that it is, to put it gently, relatively unlikely that you have created a fool proof argument against God's existence that no one else has ever considered. Humility and a firm grasp on reality always walk together hand in hand.",god real past present future god god directly experience every part big difficuly one real past afterwards first sentence classical theist would make sort assertion trying make going engage dialogue anyone take seriously going make effort understanding position appear hell bent rejecting perhaps least understand correctly spark within care understanding rather pretending might fanned flame say correctly would say god bound time correct way state initial premise argument set criticizing requires understanding time relation matter going actually understand classical theist point third sentence quoted move talking god outside time simply making assertion entail past present future move assertion since god outside time everyone everything must outside time well framed way accurate way frame issue based st augustine st understanding relationship time matter -- -- relationship time matter becomes clear saying sheer nonsense going frame critique classical theism going offer something beyond sophmoric blundering misinterpretation misrepresentation premise classical theist argument regarding relationship time matter philo st augustine held interdependent confirmed modern physic see modern physic ancient faith subject limit associated time corporeal being interrelationship time matter measure time respect movement matter eg rotation earth around sun argument requires deeper understanding exposition understanding time order get argument right first place taken time understand one impressed say matter wish argument taken seriously first make serious effort consider argument figure like st augustine st thomas course requires actually make good faith effort understand term would also require smidge humility recognizing something teach put gently relatively unlikely created fool proof argument existence one else ever considered humility firm grasp reality always walk together hand hand,feser,3169,0

3250,"Hi Tom      The sentence in which I used novelty merely emphasized the point of these posts namely to demonstrate that it is possible for a pope to commit heresy and it has happened before.      Here's what I said      ""hence the urgency to show that it is possible for a Pope to commit heresy so that it isn't seen as some kind of novelty""      In this very post he mentions      ""The lessons of the case of Honorius are clear. When a pope is not speaking ex cathedra, it is possible for him to fall into error. ""      To quote Prof. Feser from twitter while he was replying to someone who questioned that the arguments in this post are also used by heretical catholics (sedes, liberals) to habitually disagree with Papal statements      ""But there are also people whose faith is shaken because they think they're expected to swallow that which contradicts past doctrine. There's a danger in not addressing that worry by keeping silent about the possibility of legitimate disagreement merely because some abuse it.""      It doesn't seem that I said anything different, danger implies urgency.      As for what you mentioned about the abuse scandals, personally, I feel it's a bit uncharitable to lay all of the blame at the feet of Pope Francis, 99% of the all the abuse took place preceding this papacy and were just revealed during this papacy, obviously there have been some hush ups which should be criticised but those same kind of cover ups took place on a very large scale during Pope St JPII's papacy, And even Pope Benedict was aware of Mccarrick and had already imposed some sanctions. How Prelates may choose to respond to some scandal is a matter of Prudence, prudence maybe wrong at times. There has also been large scale reform though in regards to the issue though, such as making the reporting process easier, efforts to make the process more transparent, candidates to priesthood are also scrutinized to a very high degree, so there has been some positive change.      As for heresy with regards to sexual morality being perpetuated at the highest level, with regards to same sex marriage and blessings of such couples and the like, the document by the CDCF which was put out awhile ago was quite firm, Pope Francis approved it. Is it not better to go by an official statement then by unconfirmed reports of someone reporting what the Pope allegedly told them.      With regards to Amoris Latetia, Orthodox Theologians like Mathew Levering have shown that the texts in doubt can be given an orthodox interpretation. Obviously it would be better if Pope Francis answered the Dubium himself and we could criticise him for that. But that doesn't entail that this issue is such that people have cause to question their faith especially when orthodox   Interpretations have been offered. In the absence of clarification, one ought to charitably go with the orthodox interpretation while respectfully awaiting a reply. If you are someone with a high position in Rome you could even respectfully use your influence to perhaps prompt some response.         As for ""leaving heterodox opinion at the highest levels standing without clear or any correction"", It can even be argued that Pope John Paul II did the same with Walter Kasper by promoting him who evidently has a heretical postion on the very issue of divorce. Pope Benedict XVI while obviously and sternly disagreeing with him on this issue, did appraisingly mention Kasper's book on Christ in the intro to his final books on the new testament and Christ.      Also if I feel that something should be expressed in a particular way, why can't I suggest it, whether it's taken or not is irrelevant and doesn't change my admiration and respect for Prof.      Elon Musk goes after who he wants without fear lol, did you forget that guy who helped save those kids from the cage.

1929,"As a brief follow up, Tony, I THINK your point is that their anathemas show that Honorius had sufficient basis to know his view was heretical, to where we in retrospect can say that he was guilty of something sufficiently close to what we today would call formal heresy. I would say the anathemas show that his condemners thought he was sufficiently guilty of BLAMEWORTHY heresy, but in time the distinction between formal and material, and its relation to ecclesiastical crime of heresy, needed to be developed in order to assess cases like Honorius' more effectively, the result being that such a condmenation today would not be tenable.

But nonetheless as the number of steps gets large, the chance at those expected winnings shrinks. Imagine that the game goes on for 200 days, the game on day 100 has finished, and you’re now choosing your policy for the next 100 days. The expected utility of playing for the next 100 days is 50 units. However, assuming you accept this policy, the probability that you will win anything over the next 100 days is less than 2−100, and if you don’t win anything, you lose 50 units of utility. So it doesn’t seem crazy to think that the no-playing policy is better, even though it has worse expected utility. In fact, it seems like quite a reasonable thing to neglect that tiny probability of winning, less than 2−100, and refuse to play. And knowing that the expected utility reasoning when extended for infinite time leads to disaster (infinite loss!) should make one feel better about the decision to violate expected utility maximization.",response finite number step course expected winning higher price pay nonetheless number step get large chance expected winning shrink imagine game go day game day finished choosing policy next day expected utility playing next day unit however assuming accept policy probability win anything next day le − win anything lose unit utility seem crazy think no-playing policy better even though worse expected utility fact seems like quite reasonable thing neglect tiny probability winning le − refuse play knowing expected utility reasoning extended infinite time lead disaster infinite loss make one feel better decision violate expected utility maximization,pruss,1051,1

1969,"(final segment--see previous 3 posts from me)      So, taking all of these points together, we are left to wonder if anyone can be declared FORMALLY heretical posthumously (at least in a case where there is no evidence they were judged heretical and obstinately persisted in their views). This then raises the question as to whether one can, and/or should, be anathematized posthumously at all. This has obviously occurred, presumably also in cases other than that of Honorius, so it certainly can happen. BUT, what we do not have in Honorius's case is a judgment that he was FORMALLY heretical (a distinction I suspect was not fully formulated or conceived at the time of Council condemning him). And once this distinction between formal and material heresy is made, we must face more squarely whether it is appropriate, or even possible, to condemn someone who is not formally heretical (as it seems Honorius could not have been). Prior to this distinction being made, we can likely forgive such anathemas, but it seems this distinction now affects how such judgments can be made (and perhaps even how we assess anathemas given before the material/formal distinction was fully developed).      In any case, we see that it was only a future pope and council who passed these judgments about a previous pope. At the very least, this should give great pause to anyone not in such authority to presume too definitely that anything a current or previous pope did was heretical. But this is especially true if one goes down the path of implying formal heresy, as for a current pope that would ultimately require the judgment of the Pope himself, and would be questionable if even a current Pope could do that in respect to a previous Pope (see above). I realize Feser is not arguing otherwise, but I suspect some who read this might apply what he says to current situations and neglect to appreciate the limits the points I raise place on such assessments. (And, we might add, such people could never have it seems even more than an opinion, though perhaps a well informed one, that a current pope held even a materially heretical view, since the judgment of heresy would ultimately fall to the Pope himself).      All this said, to reiterate a previous key point, in respect to Honorius, we can ask whether the current distinction between formal and material heresy would preclude anathemas like those against Honorius from taking place today. And, we may even ask whether the authority of a current pope would permit qualifying, or perhaps even removing, the judgment against Honorius in later councils, depending upon the extent to which one determines juridical declarations of councils (bearing in mind juridical decisions do not seem to be infallible, even if in their time they are authoritative), are or are not components of magisterial tradition which oblige agreement with current judgments, papal or otherwise.

2219,"@RunDec I wonder if stochasticism can still be connected to LFW insofar as it's often easy to predict what a person will do when faced with a set of choices due to pre-existing inclinations that strongly incline him one way or the other.      An inclination towards one particular thing can be very strong to the point where a person could basically choose that object almost every time basically, as long as the person still has the ability to choose differently, even though it's harder.      Heck, I lean towards thinking that even if an individual always chose the same object every single time, with a very strong inclination, that still wouldn't be a problem for LFW, because the concept of being able to choose differently is distinct from how many times one does so.      One could thereby rewind the tape of time / reality indefinitely many times and get the same choice made by a person, without this in any way undermining LFW.      On a different note, here's an objection to LFW I once saw that I'd like to know your thoughts on:      The idea of self-explaining sui generis choices are actually gibberish even with LFW. If my free choice is sufficient to explain itself to the exclusion of other possibilities, it isn't indeterministic.

494,"I think what we need is some careful way of computing proportionality in Double Effect. Here is a thought. Start by saying in _both_ versions of the case that the deaths of the four patients are _not_ the effects of the trolley redirection. This was very intuitive, but seemed to cause a problem in the delayed-surgeons version. However, there is a fairly natural way to reconstrue things. Take it that leaving the trolley to go along the left track results in the _good_ of saving the four patients. So far we’ve only shifted whether we count the deaths of the four as an evil on the redirection side of the ledger or the saving of the four as a good on the non-redirection side. This makes no difference to the comparison. But now add one more move: don’t count goods that result from evils in the ledger at all. This second move doesn’t affect the delayed-surgeons case. For the good of saving lives in that case is not a result of Alice’s death, and the proportionality calculation is unaffected. In particular, in that case we still get the correct result that you should not redirect the trolley, since the events relevant to proportionality are the evil of Alice’s death and the good of saving four lives, and so preventing Alice’s death is disproportionate. But in the organ case, the good of saving lives _is_ a result of Alice’s death. So in that case, Double Effect’s proportionality calculation does not include the lives saved, and hence, quite correctly, we conclude that you _should_ redirect to save Alice’s life.",think need careful way computing proportionality double effect thought start saying version case death four patient effect trolley redirection intuitive seemed cause problem delayed-surgeons version however fairly natural way reconstrue thing take leaving trolley go along left track result good saving four patient far shifted whether count death four evil redirection side ledger saving four good non-redirection side make difference comparison add one move count good result evil ledger second move affect delayed-surgeons case good saving life case result death proportionality calculation unaffected particular case still get correct result redirect trolley since event relevant proportionality evil death good saving four life preventing death disproportionate organ case good saving life result death case double proportionality calculation include life saved hence quite correctly conclude redirect save life,pruss,1529,1

1765,"@papalinton      As far as I have read what is banned in schools is only the teaching of nonsensical notions of whiteness or micro aggressions, it does not ban the teaching of facts that there are racists or white supremacists. But it does bar making white students apologise to black students for transgressions of the past or teaching that the white people of today have innate racism of which they don't know about. This is literally what is being taught in schools, muti national corporations etc. And it's not just white people, any group that has a had any measure of success in the system namely Asians, has been accused of pandering to the so called White Supremacists. If people are banning CRT at the college level is wrong but at the school level, there is really no need to teach children that America's social and economic structures are supposedly inherently designed to prevent the success of minorities. There may be particular people in the system who are acting in a racist way, that's not s failure of the system, rather it's a failure of the people to abide by the system.

3227,"A helpful and informative discussion. I will break up my reflection in multiple posts, since what I have to say is too long for a single comment.      One point I see consistently unmentioned in various assessments of Honorius I have read online over the years, though, is the importance of the distinction between formal and material heresy. I do not know when this distinction came to be (ahem) formally recognized in Catholic thought, but I suspect it was after the period of Honorius.      What is significant in this in respect to the later Vatican I's declaration of papal primacy of jurisdiction is that the Pope himself is the final court of appeal. Hence, in many cases someone might not be aware of their heresy, and hold it materially but not formally (insofar as they are not consciously and obstinately asserting a view contrary to the teaching of the Church, as made clear to them by the ecclesial authorities). In other words, it is ultimately up the ecclesial authorities, and ultimately via appeal to the Pope himself, to declare a view heretical.      It seems that it is only at that point that one who continues to hold the problematic view can be definitively called a formal heretic (such would apply earlier, of course, if the person himself acknowledged his view was heretical, but said he did not care, etc.). But in the case of one who does not consider his view heretical, it would require ecclesial judgment, and even this could be overridden by the Pope via appeal. That would be the final say, at least in that Pope's lifetime (another wrinkle in the case of Honorius, on which i'll comment more in a moment).

2349,"“ Psalm 50:11: I know all the birds of the mountains; And the wild beasts of the field are mine.”      Where suffering of animals is as part of nature, we must trust that to God. Life could not have evolved without suffering, and we must trust that the rich tapestry of dark and light is perfectly rounded in the end. “All is well” as He told Julian of Norwich. This is just faith in God’s goodness, and I have confidence that the great suffering of animals in nature will make be a necessary part of a perfect plan when we see things as they are.      Where it’s caused by humans, we are responsible. We each are called to play our part in reducing the suffering of others, as far as we are able. I can’t judge a poor person who overworks a donkey to build a house, or buys factory farmed meat, but those who can afford to support better welfare and always choose the cheapest/cruelest must be at least partly responsible for the cruelty.      It’s similar with children. We can’t see God’s full plan, but we know that life is short for all of us next to eternity. We can only play our part in reducing it where we can, and trust the rest to God.      As Augustine alludes to, some who have suffered the most can become the purest, most loving people you could meet. Others become hard and cruel. God is refining us like “silver in the furnace”. If we go with the process as he asks us to, and most of the saints actually welcome suffering in themselves, we have good reason to believe that it’s to our benefit in the long run. Most difficult of course is when it’s others suffering, especially those we love. But it’s exactly the same in that we can do what we can to help (including righteous anger in the very rare cases where that is the right response), but must do all we can to avoid becoming hard and cruel ourselves in response. Difficult as it may be, we must trust. We must try to see that what is sharp and apparently meaningless in the moment, is very different from the widest perspective.      Ultimately we are all called to follow the “suffering servant”, born to “Our Lady of Sorrows”.

Why can't we just take a more positive route and pray for the conversion and change of those who we don't think are on the right path, why must we depend on looking forward to some fantasized harsh judgement and punishment of those who have lost their way so that our faith is not shaken.      To quote Pope Benedict XVI from God is With Us from the chapter God’s Yes and His Love Are Maintained Even in Death      ""The very heart of the faith has been lost to anyone who supposes that it is only worthwhile, if it is, so to say, made worthwhile by the damnation of others. Such a way of thinking, which finds the punishment of other people necessary, springs from not having inwardly accepted the faith; from loving only oneself and not God the Creator, to whom his creatures belong. That way of thinking would be like the attitude of those people who could not bear the workers who came last being paid a denarius like the rest; like the attitude of people who feel properly rewarded only if others have received less. This would be the attitude of the son who stayed at home, who could not bear the reconciling kindness of his father. It would be a hardening of our hearts, in which it would become clear that we were only looking out for ourselves and not looking for God; in which it would be clear that we did not love our faith, but merely bore it like a burden.""      End quote      To forestall some usual tired objections, obviously this doesn't deny the reality of hell or the reality that some human beings will go to hell or the reality of punishment. These Truths are obvious from Christ's clear words where he says ""Many will not be Able"". (Although on the question of relative numbers and percentages, I am inclined to agree with Cardinal Avery Dulles where he mentioned that God hasn't provided any such stats or figures like more then 50% etc. Those who interpret the narrow path and wide path in that way are free to do so but other interpretations such as taking it to be a practical warning and not as a prediction are legitimate opinions, The pratical warning interpretation is taken by Pope Benedict XVI in ""God and The World "" under the question ""Two Roads"". As in the Book of Revelations, John mentioned he saw an innumerable crowd of people.)         The main point I am trying to make here is that, looking forward to people's punishments isn't healthy and shouldn't be encouraged.

313,"I am an eternalist. I think it's OK for the accidents of a substance to be located at a time where the substance does not exist. In one sense this isn't, however, a case of the accidents existing without the substance, because when the accidents exist presently, the substance exists, too, albeit pastly.      As for consubstantiation, here are some worries.      1\. When Jesus says ""This is my body"", it seems like he is pointing to the visible thing, namely bread. If there is bread there, then he is pointing at the bread. Thus, if there is bread there, he is making the incorrect or at least non-literal statement that that thing, the bread, is his body. But the Tradition likes to take Jesus's words here literally.      2\. According to Scripture and Tradition, we eat Christ's body and drink his blood. But on a consubstantiation view, it's not clear that this is the right way to describe it. It seems that what we really eat and drink is the co- present bread and wine, and the body and blood just happens to come along with it. Here's my image of consubstantiation. Suppose that magnetic fields are substances. Then where there is a magnet, we have something like consubstantiation: there are two substances, a magnet and a magnetic field, in the same place (I am talking of the magnetic field inside the magnet, not the one that extends outside of it). But suppose now you foolishly eat the magnet (DON'T DO IT; children have died from eating two magnets and having them pinch through intenstines). I don't think it's correct to say that you eat both substances.

3034,"Hey @Talmid and @Michael      Guys, thank you so much for the words. It really means a lot to me. I'm usually alone and with few friends and when people say things to me like you guys said it really means a lot to me - because I know the lack of that and how it really warms our hearts when people care for us. So thank you, thank you so much!      @Michael, I saw the post that Ed made with an open thread and I will participate! Today was the first day in weeks that I felt a little bit better. I will try somehow engage in the arguments there, because like I said, I'm not worried about materialism per se (even though the existence of atoms and etc. sometimes puzzle me as to why God makes the world that way, you know? Why the micro exists in a way that it 'seems' that things could be ""reduced"" to them) because of the arguments Ed presented in the prolegomenon of the Scholastics Meta (I only believed materialism in this XXI century sense because I was a foolish boy born in a country that philosophy that is seriously engaging in these points marginally exists - yeah continental philosophy sucks).      My problem is the worse version of 'materialism' that is the buddhist (because in practice, doesn't matter how they argue, the consequences are basically the same but, surprisingly, worse). In these very difficult (to say the least) 3 years of my life. What really broke me from the inside (based on what I was talking about Libet) is the fact that I (and the person that I love with my life in this world, my mom, who's in fact the only family that I have in practice) could indeed be a substance per accidens (to use the best terminology) - because ALL of these ideologies like reductionism, materialism, and especially buddhism will lead to that no matter how they try to persuade or say otherwise. They will inevitably treat human beings as unreal and aggregates or 'useful fictions' (sometimes I think that it was the devil himself who plunges these ideologies into our mentality).      If there is one thing in all these 3 years that I do not forget was the pain (the mental pain and depression) that I felt and still feel. In my 24 years of life, nothing EVER hit me like that. And I don't know how people simply swallow materialism or even worse buddhism of these sorts - if they do really love their own kind ones or have any moral principles about persons at all - they should be rejecting it immediately. Because as I said what caused me all that trauma that still scares me today is the possibility of those things (i.e the fact that we are just an aggregate or unreal and live just to suffer). It's simply devilish. Why would anyone want to live in a world like that? You know.",hey talmid michael guy thank much word really mean lot usually alone friend people say thing like guy said really mean lot - know lack really warms heart people care u thank thank much michael saw post ed made open thread participate today first day week felt little bit better try somehow engage argument like said worried materialism per se even though existence atom etc sometimes puzzle god make world way know micro exists way seems thing could reduced argument ed presented prolegomenon scholastic meta believed materialism xxi century sense foolish boy born country philosophy seriously engaging point marginally exists - yeah continental philosophy suck problem worse version materialism buddhist practice matter argue consequence basically surprisingly worse difficult say least year life really broke inside based talking libet fact person love life world mom fact family practice could indeed substance per accidens use best terminology - ideology like reductionism materialism especially buddhism lead matter try persuade say otherwise inevitably treat human being unreal aggregate useful sometimes think devil plunge ideology mentality one thing year forget pain mental pain depression felt still feel year life nothing ever hit like know people simply swallow materialism even worse buddhism sort - really love kind one moral principle person - rejecting immediately said caused trauma still scare today possibility thing ie fact aggregate unreal live suffer simply devilish would anyone want live world like know,feser,2703,0
2614,"Hi Ed,      In your interview, you state:      ""You’ll also find – and this is something that I discuss in my book – that the Catholic Church and the popes have officially taught for five centuries now that the kind of slavery that was practiced in the New World and the kind of slavery represented by the African slave trade was intrinsically evil. The popes condemned this consistently from the beginning. Now, it’s true that there were a lot of people who simply ignored the teaching but that was indeed the teaching. People often have this false impression…that somehow the Church is a late comer to this. Well, no. In fact, the Church has been consistently condemning what’s called chattel slavery – or the treatment of other human beings as if they were mere pieces of property or as if they were animals or something – for centuries even if the teaching was, again, often ignored.""      I have to say that this is simply incorrect. I refer you to Pius Onyemechi Adiele's work, ""The Popes, the Catholic Church and the Transatlantic   Enslavement of Black Africans 1418-1839"" (Georg Olms Verlag AG, Hildesheim 2017), which was accepted as a Doctoral Dissertation in 2014 by the Faculty of Catholic Theology of the University of Tübingen. The author carried out his research at the Vatican Secret Archives (ASV) as well as the Portuguese National Archives (ANTT). His book is available online:      https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/id/8aa95306-9256-443f-9e89-de5871874288/external_content.pdf      With a wealth of impressively documented scholarship, Adiele demonstrates that the Popes actively supported the enslavement of Africans and the Transatlantic slave trade for nearly four centuries. He writes: ""Even in the face of numerous protests made by some anti-slavery proponents in both Europe and America against the continued unjust enslavement of Black Africans, none of the popes of the Church beginning from the renaissance papacy in the fifteenth century, throughout the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries and up to the first three decades of the nineteenth century ever remembered to hearken to those voices of protests so as to extend their fatherly concern towards Black Africans laboring under the chains of Transatlantic slavery... Even in the sixteenth century precisely in 1537 during the papacy of pope Paul III, when the papacy at last began to show interest in the sufferings of peoples held under the bondage of slavery by condemning the enslavement of the Indians of the West Indies, the Black Africans were left out and ignored in this papal interest in protecting those under enslavement... The papacy showed her concern for Black Africans in 1814 and 1823 respectively only at the motivation of the British government and only on the condition that the British government will help the Church to recover her lost Papal States which were taken away from her by the Napoleonic invasion and occupation of the Papal States in 1808.""      I'll leave it to my readers to decide whether Adiele has the better of the argument.",hi ed interview state youll also find – something discus book – catholic church pope officially taught five century kind slavery practiced new world kind slavery represented african slave trade intrinsically evil pope condemned consistently beginning true lot people simply ignored teaching indeed teaching people often false impression…that somehow church late comer well fact church consistently condemning called chattel slavery – treatment human being mere piece property animal something – century even teaching often ignored say simply incorrect refer pius onyemechi work pope catholic church transatlantic enslavement black african - georg olm verlag ag hildesheim accepted doctoral dissertation faculty catholic theology university tübingen author carried research vatican secret archive asv well portuguese national archive antt book available online httpslibraryoapenorgbitstreamidaa -- f-e-deexternalcontentpdf wealth impressively documented scholarship adiele demonstrates pope actively supported enslavement african transatlantic slave trade nearly four century writes even face numerous protest made anti-slavery proponent europe america continued unjust enslavement black african none pope church beginning renaissance papacy fifteenth century throughout seventeenth eighteenth century first three decade nineteenth century ever remembered hearken voice protest extend fatherly concern towards black african laboring chain transatlantic slavery even sixteenth century precisely papacy pope paul iii papacy last began show interest suffering people held bondage slavery condemning enslavement indian west indie black african left ignored papal interest protecting enslavement papacy showed concern black african respectively motivation british government condition british government help church recover lost papal state taken away napoleonic invasion occupation papal state leave reader decide whether adiele better argument,feser,3055,0
3276,"Dr. Feser, respectfully, you make a clear error here. The council being wrong about Honorious being a heretic would be an error in a judgment of historical fact, not a matter of faith and morals. The matter of faith and morals would be the judgment of monothelitism as heresy, which is entirely true and accurate; whether or not Honorious was a heretic is a matter of historical fact and judgment, and the Council is not and never has been stated to be protected on questions of that kind. You claim that judging Honorious to be a heretic is a matter of faith and morals, but this is wrong; the matter of faith and morals is the condemnation of the *teaching* as heresy. If a judgment of an individual as a heretic was protected infallibly, excommunications could not be lifted years after someone's death, yet this happens all the time.      If Honorious was using his authority as the Pope to teach - and I disagree that writing anything in a private letter rises to such authority, as when the Pope attempts to teach something to the universal church he addresses the Church directly - then Honorious cannot teach heresy. The reason is that we are obliged to give religious assent of will to anything a Pope teaches from the ordinary magisterium, and the Magisterium cannot bind us to sin.      Honorious was *possibly* a heretic by the standards the Councils were using at the time but absolutely *not* a heretic by the standards we use to judge heresy today, as monothelitism had not yet been definitively judged as false by the Church. If we were to call him a heretic in the way that Vatican I understands the term, we'd also have to call St. Thomas Aquinas a heretic for rejecting the Immaculate Conception.      So I disagree with your argument here. The Magisterium cannot teach heresy as understood by Vatican I's definitions of teach, heresy, and Magisterium, and Honorious did no such thing.",dr feser respectfully make clear error council wrong honorious heretic would error judgment historical fact matter faith moral matter faith moral would judgment monothelitism heresy entirely true accurate whether honorious heretic matter historical fact judgment council never stated protected question kind claim judging honorious heretic matter faith moral wrong matter faith moral condemnation teaching heresy judgment individual heretic protected infallibly excommunication could lifted year death yet happens time honorious using authority pope teach - disagree writing anything private letter rise authority pope attempt teach something universal church address church directly - honorious teach heresy reason obliged give religious assent anything pope teach ordinary magisterium magisterium bind u sin honorious possibly heretic standard council using time absolutely heretic standard use judge heresy today monothelitism yet definitively judged false church call heretic way vatican understands term also call st thomas aquinas heretic rejecting immaculate conception disagree argument magisterium teach heresy understood vatican definition teach heresy magisterium honorious thing,feser,1904,0

The problem of evil (or at least the logical version of the problem of evil that you keep harping on about), is a philosophical demonstration that the existence of evil is inconsistent with God’s attributes of goodness, omnipotence, etc. If Plato’s good work an argument provides a potential “out” then the argument in the problem of evil fails because the conclusion does not follow from the premises.      Notice how in the thousands of words that Dr. Feser has devoted to the topic of existential inertia, he has never once asked “where is the hard evidence for existential inertia?” Because it doesn’t matter if you have independent reasons to think such a thing exists. If the mere possibility of it’s existence is consistent with the metaphysical premises of the classical theists, then (most) cosmological arguments fail.

128,"Yeah, I think I made a number of mistakes in my argument.      On consequentialism what is evaluated is the action, not the end of the action. So even if my winning has lower utility than your winning under similar circumstances, it does not follow that my trying to win has lower utility than my not trying to win. There are two possibilities, after all, assuming I try to win. Either I will succeed or I won't. If I won't succeed, then the harder I tried, the more enjoyable the victory for you, for your fans and for my fans. If I do succeed, the utility is lower than if I had tried and you nonetheless succeeded (I am assuming your victory has higher utility), but it may still be higher than had I failed to try (in which case very likely I would not have succeeded) because then there would have been general disappointment. So a case can be made that my trying to win is better than my not trying to win, even if other things being equal my winning is worse than your winning. And similar things seem to hold on expected utility versions.      Still, suppose that the utility of your winning is higher than of my winning, and I am about to win, but I have some subtle way of throwing the game so no one can tell, and everyone will enjoy the game pretty much as much. Then on externalist consequentialism I should throw the game in this way. Whether such a way of throwing the game is available depends on many factors: what the game is, who the audience are, what level one and one's opponent are. Still, there are probably a number of combinations where such throwing is available, and the slight loss in quality of play is outweighed by the benefits of your winning.",yeah think made number mistake argument consequentialism evaluated action end action even winning lower utility winning similar circumstance follow trying win lower utility trying win two possibility assuming try win either succeed succeed harder tried enjoyable victory fan fan succeed utility lower tried nonetheless succeeded assuming victory higher utility may still higher failed try case likely would succeeded would general disappointment case made trying win better trying win even thing equal winning worse winning similar thing seem hold expected utility version still suppose utility winning higher winning win subtle way throwing game one tell everyone enjoy game pretty much much externalist consequentialism throw game way whether way throwing game available depends many factor game audience level one opponent still probably number combination throwing available slight loss quality play outweighed benefit winning,pruss,1676,1

3239,"@Ed Feser      So why believe Chapman over Bellarmine?      Seems the problem is the term ""heresy"" has undergone a development over the past 2000 years. The Greek term literally means to break off from the whole. In it's early use simply not following the discipline of the Church made you a heretic (where as in later times we would call you a mere schismatic). Thought in later times it is narrowly defined to refer to professing a false & formally condemned doctrinal proposition.      Allowing heresy to be taught or failing to condemn it can get you labelled a ""heretic"" even if you do not hold to any formal doctrinal or moral errors.      Also I think condemning anybody as a heretic is an act of discipline not faith and morals. I don't think the Catholic Church has the power to infallibly say Nestorius was a heretic. But she can infallibly say Nestorianism (the false view Christ is two persons, one divine and one human attributed to Nestorius) is heresy.      Which is why you can in theory rehabilitate a heretic. You don't know their subjective intent with any certainty. But you can know a given doctrinal proposition is false when the Church has clearly condemned it.

If you will vanilla ice (for whatever reason), then, unless something happens to prevent this choice you have vanilla ice and not chocolate ice.""      How on earth can I choose what to eat, then? The picture you described is literally my will - completely outside of my control - determining my choice to either get vanilla or chocolate depending on some property arising in it - and you suggest that the causal origin of that property is irrelevant for whether we are libertarian free or not! That it doesn't matter where it came from. So in your model I can - with no control over it, no choice over it - just get a ""will"" to have vanilla ice and this will make me get vanilla ice instead of chocolate (unless something happens to prevent it, again something over which I presumably have no control over since all my actions would just follow upon another will arising, and it wouldn't matter where that will came from, according to you).   In what world is that libertarian freedom? That is just people being determined by a will over which they have no control. I don't think any LFW proponent would agree with that model; certainly I think most LFW theorists would agree with me. And then you just refuse to elaborate on the potential regress of the origins of the ""will"" and how, in your model, it cannot arise by the choice of the agent (since you must refuse that A at t in S can cause either X or ~X).   I am surprised that you think this would count as LFW.      I take it as essential that in LFW *we* are the ones making our choices, in an indeterministic but non-stochastic way; that we cause our actions and do so in such a way that, when we're deliberating, we can really cause one or the other at that moment, and thus under the same set of intrinsic properties.      I say we can reach an agreement and a common conclusion here: you and I have radically different ideas of LFW. So if someone accepts your model, then indeed they will have a problem with God's choice in DS. If someone subscribes to your model of LFW, then that objection to DS is a serious one, and perhaps there is no way around it.      But if someone accepts my model of LFW (or, even more modestly, accepts my model as metaphysically possible) instead, then the problem disappears. Because in my model, the agent can cause either X or ~X without requiring a difference in intrinsic properties for choosing one or the other. It's not unique to God, it's the same for humans, too.      So if someone accepts your model of libertarian freedom (call it LFW1) then the objection is very much alive. Well done.

3383,"@Infinite Growth (continued)      The area that we have to be most careful in is in judging particular intentions associated with a particular act. It is here that judgements are most unsure. Now, we also have to be careful not to completely de-link intentions from the exterior act. (This is a problem that occurred in 20th century Catholic theology. On this point, see Matthew Levering's recent book The Abuse of Conscience). The act is intended by the person and if the act is bad then the intention is bad in some way. However, the person again may be acting from ignorance or confusion or trying to achieve some real good and yet be going about it in the wrong way. In this instance, you can again explain moral principles and why a particular act is not good and this should help to guide their intentions in the future as they realize, for example, that a good end does not justify a bad means. etc.      However some people are in fact habitually bad. That is, they have bad character. In this instance another work of mercy is called for: Rebuking the sinner.      Regarding your suggestion that our only enemy is the principalities, this also is based on a partial reading of St. Paul. St. Paul also identifies the flesh as our enemy in Galatians 5:19ff, ""Now the deeds of the flesh (Greek: sarx) are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, etc..."" He warns that those who practice these things will not inherit the kingdom of God. Flesh is used in multiple and analogous ways in the NT and can be used to simply refer to the body, but here it refers to sinful desires, intentions and acts. So the flesh, in this sense, is also an enemy of the Christian according to Paul.      If we take a broader focus on the New Testament, we also find that ""the world"" (Greek: kosmos) is also an enemy of the Christian and this is reflected in the writings of St. John. Kosmos is also used in multiple senses in the NT so this does not entail that each use refers to something bad. However, a worldly spirit that says ""Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die"" (i.e. ""this world is all there is""; hence worldliness) is contrary to authentic faith and is another enemy of the Christian.      It is for this reason that the council of Trent identified three enemies of the Catholic viator: Satan, the world, and the flesh. So, the suggestion that we have only one enemy is based on a partial consideration of the New Testament at the exclusion of other parts.",infinite growth continued area careful judging particular intention associated particular act judgement unsure also careful completely de-link intention exterior act problem occurred th century catholic theology point see matthew recent book abuse conscience act intended person act bad intention bad way however person may acting ignorance confusion trying achieve real good yet going wrong way instance explain moral principle particular act good help guide intention future realize example good end justify bad mean etc however people fact habitually bad bad character instance another work mercy called rebuking sinner regarding suggestion enemy principality also based partial reading st paul st paul also identifies flesh enemy galatian ff deed flesh greek sarx evident immorality impurity sensuality idolatry sorcery enmity strife jealousy etc warns practice thing inherit kingdom god flesh used multiple analogous way nt used simply refer body refers sinful desire intention act flesh sense also enemy christian according paul take broader focus new testament also find world greek kosmos also enemy christian reflected writing st john kosmos also used multiple sens nt entail use refers something bad however worldly spirit say eat drink merry tomorrow die ie world hence worldliness contrary authentic faith another enemy christian reason council trent identified three enemy catholic viator satan world flesh suggestion one enemy based partial consideration new testament exclusion part,feser,2520,0
2776,"An essential part of the interpretative context is surely Pope Francis' Apostolic Exhortation 'Evangelii Gaudium': 'On the Proclamation of the Gospel in Today's World' - considered a keynote document of his pontificate, and running to 288 numbered paragraphs. Less authoritative and isolated statements should be interpreted in the light of more authoritative and extended statements such as this.      A few quotes:      ‘Throughout the world, let us be “permanently in a state of mission”.’ (25; cf. passim)      ‘All the baptized, whatever their position in the Church or their level of instruction in the faith, are agents of evangelization.’ (120)      ‘All revealed truths derive from the same divine source and are to be believed with the same faith…’ (36)      ‘Of course, we will never be able to make the Church’s teachings easily understood or readily appreciated by everyone. Faith always remains something of a cross; it retains a certain obscurity which does not detract from the firmness of its assent.’ (42)      ‘Proclaiming the Gospel message to different cultures also involves proclaiming it to professional, scientific and academic circles. This means an encounter between faith, reason and the sciences with a view to developing new approaches and arguments on the issue of credibility, a creative apologetics which would encourage greater openness to the Gospel on the part of all. When certain categories of reason and the sciences are taken up into the proclamation of the message, these categories then become tools of evangelization; water is changed into wine.’ (132)      ‘Evangelization with joy becomes beauty in the liturgy, as part of our daily concern to spread goodness. The Church evangelizes and is herself evangelized through the beauty of the liturgy, which is both a celebration of the task of evangelization and the source of her renewed self-giving.’ (24)      ‘As the bishops of the United States of America have rightly pointed out, while the Church insists on the existence of objective moral norms which are valid for everyone, there are those in our culture who portray this teaching as unjust, that is, as opposed to basic human rights. Such claims usually follow from a form of moral relativism that is joined, not without inconsistency, to a belief in the absolute rights of individuals.’ (64)      ‘Among the vulnerable for whom the Church wishes to care with particular love and concern are unborn children, the most defenceless and innocent among us. Nowadays efforts are made to deny them their human dignity and to do with them whatever one pleases, taking their lives and passing laws preventing anyone from standing in the way of this. Frequently, as a way of ridiculing the Church’s effort to defend their lives, attempts are made to present her position as ideological, obscurantist and conservative. Yet this defence of unborn life is closely linked to the defence of each and every other human right… This is not something subject to alleged reforms or “modernizations”. It is not “progressive” to try to resolve problems by eliminating a human life.’ (213)      ‘A facile syncretism would ultimately be a totalitarian gesture on the part of those who would ignore greater values of which they are not the masters. True openness involves remaining steadfast in one’s deepest convictions, clear and joyful in one’s own identity, while at the same time being “open to understanding those of the other party” and “knowing that dialogue can enrich each side” (John Paul II). What is not helpful is a diplomatic openness which says “yes” to everything in order to avoid problems, for this would be a way of deceiving others and denying them the good which we have been given to share generously with others. Evangelization and interreligious dialogue, far from being opposed, mutually support and nourish one another.’ (251)      All this may not resolve all the issues with things Francis has said and done, but it needs to be taken into account.

277,"Wesley:      1\. But you can seek something for its own sake while seeking it for the sake of something else as well.      2\. So, this is the weird thing about my example: the non-instrumental value is being instrumentally pursued. (It kind of reminds me of Frege's infamous ""The concept horse is not a concept"".) But the point remains that the non- instrumental value is indeed a goal one has, just as when one is seeking to rob a bank, the obtaining of the tools is a goal one has. Sure, you can use ""goal"" or ""reason"" in such a way as to indicate the ultimate goal which one non-instrumentally pursues, but then the account of non-instrumental pursuit becomes circular: you non-instrumentally pursue X iff X is your non- instrumentally pursued goal      By the way, one can combine my truth and ""volitional inertia"" examples. Suppose that a rich eccentric is paying me each time I get something of intrinsic value. I am greedy and generally lacking in virtue, so I pursue all sorts of things of intrinsic value solely for the sake of money. Then the eccentric withdraws the offer.

1936,"(continued from previous 2 posts)      With this in mind, take the question now to the issue of future Popes making judgments about the views of previous popes. As Vatican I notes, we might ask if a future Pope could override the judgment of a previous Pope as to whether that previous view was indeed heretical or not. Indeed, this might even hold to the previous Pope's own views. BUT, it is still hard to see how one could judge that the previous pope was FORMALLY heretical, since he presumably would not have taken his own view to be heretical. Could a future pope judge that a previous pope really did know his view to be heretical, etc.?      This raises some very thorny issues indeed. It seems to me that this could not occur because as I understand it, part of the process of declaring someone a formal heretic is that the person is confronted by the authority with a judgment of heresy, and obstinately persists in his views. Obviously, this cannot happen for someone who is deceased.      Another difficulty of course is that if we say future popes can override the judgment of prior popes, then we would also have to hold that an even later pope could override THAT judgment, and so on. BUT, given that we hold that Popes are bound by magisterial teaching, one might ask how this could happen. Or, are popes bound only by magisterial teaching, and not by all previous magisterial juridical decisions, etc.? If we hold that juridical judgments are not infallible (even if they are authoritative in their time), then it seems one could, in theory, later remove the anathemas of Honorius, or whatever. (It certainly seems in other cases a future pope could override earlier papal juridical decisions--e.g., we can conceive of a person excommunicated being reinstated in the church by a future pope, and so on--does this change when the decisions are concretized in conciliar declarations, etc.? Important questions--to be continued, one final segment....).

3388,"Now, I sympathize with Chomsky’s view that the so-called hard problem of consciousness is a pseudo-problem. As I said in my exchange with Goff, I would say that the problem arises only if we follow Galileo and his early modern successors in holding that color, odor, sound, heat, cold, and other “secondary qualities” do not really exist in matter in the way common sense supposes them to, but instead exist only in the mind (as the qualia of conscious experience) and are projected by us onto external reality. If you take this position, you are stuck with a conception of matter that makes it impossible to regard consciousness as material. The solution, I would say, is simply not to go along with this assumption in the first place, but to return to the Aristotelian-Scholastic view the early moderns reacted against, and which is compatible with the commonsense view of matter. The so-called hard problem of consciousness then dissolves. As Chomsky’s remarks later in the discussion make clear, he would be sympathetic with part of this story (though not, I’m sure, with the neo-Aristotelian bit).",sympathize view so-called hard problem consciousness pseudo-problem said exchange goff would say problem arises follow galileo early modern successor holding color odor sound heat cold “ secondary quality ” really exist matter way common sense supposes instead exist mind qualia conscious experience projected u onto external reality take position stuck conception matter make impossible regard consciousness material solution would say simply go along assumption first place return aristotelian-scholastic view early modern reacted compatible commonsense view matter so-called hard problem consciousness dissolve remark later discussion make clear would sympathetic part story though sure neo-aristotelian bit,feser,1102,0

396,"There are two interrelated questions: the conditions under which we have almost sure convergence to the mean and the conditions under which we have the particular kind of divergence that my argument uses--where almost surely if we accept the gambles, we lose an infinite amount and gain only a finite amount.      The convergence question concerns necessary and sufficient conditions for the Strong Law of Large Numbers. Kolmogorov showed that the variance condition is sufficient (assuming throughout that all the random variables have finite expectations). But it is not necessary for convergence (indeed Prokhorov showed that no condition solely on variances can be a necessary and sufficient condition for convergence). Necessary and sufficient conditions were given by Nagaev ( https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/1117072 ), but research on refinement continues ( https://www.jstor.org/stable/2160636 ). In any case, the failure to meet the condition Pekoz gives does not imply lack of convergence.      Further, lack of convergence is not by itself enough to clearly show that it isn't rational to engage in expected utility maximization. After all, lack of convergence is compatible with the hypothesis that your total winnings will be infinite and your total losings will be infinite, in which case it's unclear if it's rational to play or not.      However, it is much simpler to characterize cases that look like my example if we assume independence (by the way, my original example does not assume independence, because the Borel-Cantelli Lemma, unlike its converse which I am about to use, does not need independence).      I can run my argument with any sequence Y_1,Y_2,... of random variables each of which has positive expected value, but where the sum P(Y_n > -epsilon) is finite for some positive epsilon. In that case, expected utility maximization says to accept each gamble, but if you follow that advice, you will (almost surely) get a result at least as bad as -epsilon in all but finitely many cases. If the random variables are independent, then by the converse Borel- Cantelli Lemma, the condition that the sum of those probabilities is finite is necessary for the claim that almost surely you will get a result at least as bad as -epsilon in all but finitely many cases.",two interrelated question condition almost sure convergence mean condition particular kind divergence argument us -- almost surely accept gamble lose infinite amount gain finite amount convergence question concern necessary sufficient condition strong law large number kolmogorov showed variance condition sufficient assuming throughout random variable finite expectation necessary convergence indeed prokhorov showed condition solely variance necessary sufficient condition convergence necessary sufficient condition given nagaev httpsepubssiamorgdoiabs research refinement continues httpswwwjstororgstable case failure meet condition pekoz give imply lack convergence lack convergence enough clearly show rational engage expected utility maximization lack convergence compatible hypothesis total winning infinite total losings infinite case unclear rational play however much simpler characterize case look like example assume independence way original example assume independence borel-cantelli lemma unlike converse use need independence run argument sequence yy random variable positive expected value sum pyn -epsilon finite positive epsilon case expected utility maximization say accept gamble follow advice almost surely get result least bad -epsilon finitely many case random variable independent converse borel- cantelli lemma condition sum probability finite necessary claim almost surely get result least bad -epsilon finitely many case,pruss,2300,1

2159,"@Walter      You are only different after the decision, not before. The decision is itself a self-determination to a possibility. The self-determination does not exist until actually willed. Hence why it is free. We can conceive different outcomes because the determination is not there until it is there; there is a real sense in which the agent creates the determination. This is the reason I emphasized simultaneous agent causation as well as equivocal causation. Event causation gets you a vicious regress or no real decision at all.      As far as ""randomness"" goes, that would only hold if you assume the outcomes already have some nascent individually determinate reality that are coin flipped between, which is not the case here; moreover the possibilities considered altogether can also be viewed as a region that an agent's individual determinations are bounded by.      Further, a distribution of an agent's decisions does not tell you by what means they come about. Heads on a coin flip is not determined by P(H)=0.5. It's determined by the physics of an actual flip; P(H) tends to 0.5 given the symmetry of a coin.      With respect to an agent, given their beliefs and their character you can have a rough idea of how they will act; but that would just constitute the boundaries of decisions, not the actual act of self-determination itself.      The relevance to divine simplicity is quite clear since this issue is integral to analogously understanding God's will and freedom in relation to modal collapse.      @JoeD      The objection begs the question. The choice does not exist in the agent somehow that is then univocally transmitted into the outcome, which is what the objection requires.      The choice is in fact created in a certain sense and reflects a way the agent can self determine. Prior to the choice there is nothing and no self- determination. There is no contrastive otherwise possible here. Hence the actual free willing is sufficient to explain the choice because it is coincident with the choice. Self-determination is something like marking off a number in a continuous region, not picking a stone out of a discrete pile of stones. The determination and the decision are one in the same thing, not two events, and so the sui generis willings are relevantly explanatory.",walter different decision decision self-determination possibility self-determination exist actually willed hence free conceive different outcome determination real sense agent creates determination reason emphasized simultaneous agent causation well equivocal causation event causation get vicious regress real decision far randomness go would hold assume outcome already nascent individually determinate reality coin flipped case moreover possibility considered altogether also viewed region individual determination bounded distribution decision tell mean come head coin flip determined ph determined physic actual flip ph tends given symmetry coin respect agent given belief character rough idea act would constitute boundary decision actual act self-determination relevance divine simplicity quite clear since issue integral analogously understanding freedom relation modal collapse joed objection begs question choice exist agent somehow univocally transmitted outcome objection requires choice fact created certain sense reflects way agent self determine prior choice nothing self- determination contrastive otherwise possible hence actual free willing sufficient explain choice coincident choice self-determination something like marking number continuous region picking stone discrete pile stone determination decision one thing two event sui generis willing relevantly explanatory,feser,2309,0

226,"But I think in the finite case one can remove the counterintuitiveness. For there are mixed strategies that if adopted by everyone are better than everyone choosing _A_ or everyone choosing _B_. The mixed strategy will involve choosing some number 0 < _p_ best < _q_ (where _q_ is the threshold ratio at which the disaster happens) and everyone choosing _B_ with probability _p_ best and _A_ with probability 1 − _p_ best, where _p_ best is carefully optimized allow as many people to feed hungry children without a significant risk of disaster. The exact value of _p_ best will depend on the exact utilities involved, but will be close to _q_ if the number of agents is large, as long as the disaster doesn’t scale exponentially. Now our statistical reasoning shows that when your best estimate of the probability of other people choosing _B_ is _not_ close to the threshold ratio _q_ , you should just straight out choose _B_.

2577,"@Phil Tanny, I can appreciate the desire to avoid getting mired in perpetual kvetching, but it is untrue that unless I can provide an alternative solution, I have no right to dismiss or reject an idea.      I also disagree with the problem statement and the premise that the solution involves some kind of massive payout by the so-called 1%. First, a wealth disparity between racial groups is not per se a problem to be solved. Second, if it is a problem, it isn't necessarily the result of any kind of racism in any tangible sense. It could be cultural, and I claim that the problem is largely cultural (for example, Thomas Sowell, for example, opines that the disintegration of the black family beginning in the 1960s, often assisted by well-meaning social programs, has had a devastating effect on black Americans; I would also mention ideologies of perpetual powerlessness and victimhood that both demoralize and divert energy away from constructive activity toward ineffectual grievance and blame). Third, even if it were racist, I don't see what the rich have to do with it unless you can show that they employ racist policies specifically to impoverish certain racial groups (the targeting of the rich under the pretext that they benefit from a rigged system is the kind of sloppy and unjust rationalization I would expect from a Marxist who foments class conflict). Fourth, throwing money at problems is precisely what (per Sowell) created much of the problems we're seeing today. NGOs, often run by wealthy philanthropists, offer a relevant example of how funneling money and free goods into causes can cause more damage than it solves (the destruction of the Nigerian cotton and textile industry through mitumba, the destruction of Haitian farming through free rice given long after a crisis has passed, even something like the effect of TOMS on African shoe manufacturing and repair). I'm not saying *charitable* work cannot help, but I would be very suspicious of any ""philanthropic"" or even government-mandated solution given their track record. More importantly, no amount of money can solve the basic problem which, again, is cultural. Maybe Catholic missionaries could play a role here. The Catholic Church is, after all, what turned even the pig-chasing savages of Europe into something resembling a civilization. Only after the Church has given structure to the mission to lift black America out of spiritual and moral decay and, secondarily, poverty, does talk of money make sense because only then can it be used and allocated prudently and with care. But expect also a good deal of opposition from those who pretend to be concerned for such minorities, especially when the Catholic Church is involved and from those whose careers depend on maintaining the present status quo.",phil tanny appreciate desire avoid getting mired perpetual kvetching untrue unless provide alternative solution right dismiss reject idea also disagree problem statement premise solution involves kind massive payout so-called first wealth disparity racial group per se problem solved second problem necessarily result kind racism tangible sense could cultural claim problem largely cultural example thomas sowell example opines disintegration black family beginning often assisted well-meaning social program devastating effect black american would also mention ideology perpetual powerlessness victimhood demoralize divert energy away constructive activity toward ineffectual grievance blame third even racist see rich unless show employ racist policy specifically impoverish certain racial group targeting rich pretext benefit rigged system kind sloppy unjust rationalization would expect marxist foments class conflict fourth throwing money problem precisely per sowell created much problem seeing today ngo often run wealthy philanthropist offer relevant example funneling money free good cause cause damage solves destruction nigerian cotton textile industry mitumba destruction haitian farming free rice given long crisis passed even something like effect tom african shoe manufacturing repair saying charitable work help would suspicious philanthropic even government-mandated solution given track record importantly amount money solve basic problem cultural maybe catholic missionary could play role catholic church turned even pig-chasing savage europe something resembling civilization church given structure mission lift black america spiritual moral decay secondarily poverty talk money make sense used allocated prudently care expect also good deal opposition pretend concerned minority especially catholic church involved whose career depend maintaining present status quo,feser,2796,0

If Daniel is on the soccer team and deciding how hard to work, it makes little difference whether he is on the Belgian or Brazilian team. But suppose instead that Daniel is has two talents: he could become an excellent nurse or a top soccer player. As a nurse, he would help relieve the suffering of a number of patients. As a soccer player, in addition to the intrinsic goods of the sports, he would contribute to his fellow citizens’ pleasure and desire satisfaction. In _this_ decision, it seems that the number of fellow citizens _does_ matter. The number of people Daniel can help as a nurse is not very dependent on the total population, but the number of people that his soccer skills can delight varies linearly with the total population, and if the latter number is large enough, it seems that it would be quite reasonable for Daniel to opt to be a soccer player.

But that's just how I feel. And I admit that I think that I am only that way not just because of the overwhelming OCD that keeps triggering that thought and fear of being wrong in my mind but because I am too stupid and dumb to get things right (I'm not ashamed of saying that because it is true). If you ask me why metaphysical ideas are not affected by empirical conclusions I don't know what to say because I am simply too illiterate to understand the 'why question' and the difference between the two in the first place (even though I read Ed's blog posts about that e.g that one about the philosophy of nature). And I am afraid that someday some ""discovery"" may overthrow all of this.      I know that by the way the empirical sciences are derived today i.e that mathematized and abstract way it has nothing to do with and can't even scratch the A-T Meta at all. But my fear is what if there's some change in the methods or what if some way they could someway turn the tables against us? I admit that is not very clear to me how Metaphysics is separated from empirical matters.      But I remember seeing videos on youtube where Ed explains his road from atheism to theism (i.e by the way of philosophical reason and a lot of time studying those matters) and I think to myself: ""look at the certain look in the eyes of this man and how he defends the arguments he exposes"". I know that for a philosopher a straight face and seriousness don't mean that the argument is, in fact, good, but for the average joe like me, the impressions mean a lot (especially from a guy that comes from the other team i.e the atheist side because there must be some serious argument that made him change his mind in the first place). I think that you guys may understand what I want to say now. At the end of the day, every man wishes to learn the truth and die with it.      I don't know what to say. At Ed's blog, I somehow feel at home - even though I feel a lot of shame and fear of people mocking me and not taking me seriously, for example - it's hard to talk about that at least for me.

3335,"I have a bone to pick with the reasoning given here:      _And again, “we ought, in this kind of judgment, to aim at judging a man good, unless there is evident proof of the contrary.” To be sure, we might frequently be misled as a result. However, argues Aquinas, this is preferable to the outcome that would follow if we did not give others a presumption of innocence:       **He who interprets doubtful matters for the best, may happen to be deceived more often than not; yet it is better to err frequently through thinking well of a wicked man, than to err less frequently through having an evil opinion of a good man, because in the latter case an injury is inflicted, but not in the former.**_      I suggest: _On the contrary:      “Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. (Matt 5:13      …and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame. (1 Peter 3:16)      If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. (1 Peter 4:14)      No weapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every tongue that accuses you.   This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and this is their vindication from me,” declares the Lord. (Isaiah 54:17)      For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me,   speaking against me with lying tongues. (Ps. 109:2)   But thou, O God my Lord,   deal on my behalf for thy name's sake;   because thy steadfast love is good, deliver me! (Ps. 109:21)   Help me. O Lord my God!   Save me according to thy steadfast love!   Let them know that this is thy hand;   thou, O lord, hast done it!   let them curse, but do thou bless! (Ps. 109:26-28) _      So, arguably, the mere _thought <.i> against a man is not injury to him.      I don't think it is easy to establish the last statement in ""in the latter case, an injury is inflicted, but not in the former."" Let me suggest the opposite: As often as you injure an innocent man when you judge him evil, just as often so also you injure _yourself or others_ when you judge an evil man to be innocent.      To argue this: Let me distinguish: if you judge a man evil when he isn't, but you do not ACT on this opinion in any way, you do not _actually_ injure the man as such. **YOUR** thoughts don’t affect him directly, but only via some further medium. So, the only actual injury he suffers is when you ACT on that opinion. Now, perhaps the first action you might take is to declare your judgment to others and this WOULD be harm to him (in some sense or other, perhaps), but let's eliminate this: it clearly requires not your mere judgment, but your ACT to tell others. The next most likely downstream (harmful) event from that erroneous judgment is that you won't give him some trust on some matter, and this withholding from trust does actually injure him. Any actual harm requires a transfer from your _thought_ into some secondary vehicle that goes outside yourself and impinges on him.

318,"Abstract: Scoring rules measure the accuracy or epistemic utility of a credence assignment. A significant literature uses plausible conditions on scoring rules on finite sample spaces to argue for both probabilism—the doctrine that credences ought to satisfy the axioms of probabilism—and for the optimality of Bayesian update as a response to evidence. I prove a number of formal results regarding scoring rules on infinite sample spaces that impact the extension of these arguments to infinite sample spaces. A common condition in the arguments for probabilism and Bayesian update is strict propriety: that according to each probabilistic credence, the expected accuracy of any other credence is worse. Much of the discussion needs to divide depending on whether we require finite or countable additivity of our probabilities. I show that in a number of natural infinite finitely additive cases, there simply do not exist strictly proper scoring rules, and the prospects for arguments for probabilism and Bayesian update are limited. In many natural infinite countably additive cases, on the other hand, there do exist strictly proper scoring rules that are continuous on the probabilities, and which support arguments for Bayesian update, but which do not support arguments for probabilism. There may be more hope for accuracy-based arguments if we drop the assumption that scores are extended-real-valued. I sketch a framework for scoring rules whose values are nets of extended reals, and show the existence of a strictly proper net-valued scoring rules in all infinite cases, both for f.a. and c.a. probabilities. These can be used in an argument for Bayesian update, but it is not at present known what is to be said about probabilism in this case.",abstract scoring rule measure accuracy epistemic utility credence assignment significant literature us plausible condition scoring rule finite sample space argue probabilism—the doctrine credence ought satisfy axiom probabilism—and optimality bayesian update response evidence prove number formal result regarding scoring rule infinite sample space impact extension argument infinite sample space common condition argument probabilism bayesian update strict propriety according probabilistic credence expected accuracy credence worse much discussion need divide depending whether require finite countable additivity probability show number natural infinite finitely additive case simply exist strictly proper scoring rule prospect argument probabilism bayesian update limited many natural infinite countably additive case hand exist strictly proper scoring rule continuous probability support argument bayesian update support argument probabilism may hope accuracy-based argument drop assumption score extended-real-valued sketch framework scoring rule whose value net extended real show existence strictly proper net-valued scoring rule infinite case fa ca probability used argument bayesian update present known said probabilism case,pruss,1755,1

So if someone bothered to collate all the observational data and figure out exactly which _p_ is the best fit (e.g., which one is exactly in the middle of the normal distribution that best fits all the observations), the chance that that number would be 2 up to the requisite number of significant figures would be vanishingly small, even if _in fact_ the true value is _p_ = 2.

At this point, it seems plausible that it is permissible to push the bystander in front of the trolley.",imagine likely bystander survive impact certain five people track would die perhaps trolley accelerating downhill currently chance lethality time reach five people bottom hill chance lethality perhaps five people fragile bystander well-armored simplicity also suppose trolley inflict major injury death point seems plausible permissible push bystander front trolley,pruss,637,1

450,"Second, I suspect that often when we claim to have found _y_ to be the cause of _x_ , our reason for belief that _y_ is the cause of _x_ depends on our assumption of _C_. Our best candidate for a cause of _x_ is _y_ , so we take _y_ to be the cause. But I wonder how often this inference isn’t based on our dismissing the possibility that _x_ just has no cause.",second suspect often claim found cause x reason belief cause x depends assumption c best candidate cause x take cause wonder often inference based dismissing possibility x cause,pruss,361,1
228,"_""Your giving an apple makes no difference whatsoever.""_      And yet the previous proposition of that _""interpersonal Satan's Apple""_ suggests otherwise to be the case, such that **you giving an apple MIGHT make a difference WHATSOEVER**.   Hm. I guess, that this nonsensical intuition comes from the false presupposition of _""causal finitism""_.   So don't wonder if you giving an apple might make a difference whatsoever, such that you might find that apple of yours in the hands of a [hungry child sitting behind bars alone or separated from his or her parents behind bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_administration_family_separation_policy).      Besides that, one might change the past. Well, not the past of your own timeline. But if there are multiple similar timelines, then one might be able to jump from one to another one, such that a change in the other timeline doesn't alter anything in the previous timeline, like in [Dragon Ball](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Time_Machine).   One might call this phenomenon of multiple timelines independent or branching timelines to be the ""multiverse"".

213,"However, there is still a puzzle. If it is a part of every human’s good that “I am a member of a species that landed on the moon”, does that mean the good is multiplied the more humans there are, because there are more instances of this external flourishing? I think not. External flourishing is tricky this way. The goods don’t always aggregate summatively between people in the case of external flourishing. If external flourishing were aggregated summatively, then it would have been better if Russia rather than Poland produced Copernicus, because there are more Russians than Poles, and so there would have been more people with the external good of “being a citizen of a country that produced Copernicus.” But that’s a mistake: it is a good that each Pole has, but the good doesn’t multiply with the number of Poles. Similarly, if Belgium is facing off Brazil for the World Cup, it is not the case that it would be way better if the Brazilians won, just because there are a lot more Brazilians who would have the external good of “being a fellow citizen with the winners of the World Cup.”",however still puzzle part every good “ member specie landed moon ” mean good multiplied human instance external flourishing think external flourishing tricky way good always aggregate summatively people case external flourishing external flourishing aggregated summatively would better russia rather poland produced copernicus russian pole would people external good “ citizen country produced copernicus ” mistake good pole good multiply number pole similarly belgium facing brazil world cup case would way better brazilian lot brazilian would external good “ fellow citizen winner world cup ”,pruss,1095,1
242,"Moreover, the trimming procedure can yield an answer to what I think is the biggest objection to small-probability discounting, namely that in a long enough run—and everyone should think there is a non-negligible chance of eternal life—even small probabilities can add up. If you are regularly offered the same small chance of a gigantic benefit during an eternal future, and you turn it down each time because the chance is negligible, you’re almost surely missing out on an infinite amount of value. But we can apply the trimming procedure at the level of choice of policies rather than of individual decisions. Then if small chances are offered often enough, they won’t all be trimmed away.",moreover trimming procedure yield answer think biggest objection small-probability discounting namely long enough run—and everyone think non-negligible chance eternal life—even small probability add regularly offered small chance gigantic benefit eternal future turn time chance negligible almost surely missing infinite amount value apply trimming procedure level choice policy rather individual decision small chance offered often enough trimmed away,pruss,693,1

But now imagine that the four people can be saved with synthetic organs, though only if the surgery happens very quickly. However, the only four surgeons in the region are all on an automated trolley, which is heading towards the hospital along the left track, is expected to kill Alice along the way, but will continue on until it stops at the hospital.
