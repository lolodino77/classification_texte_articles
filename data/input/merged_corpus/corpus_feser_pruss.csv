What is the actual term Aristotle uses, and how is it translated/quoted by those in other camps.      To Straussians, it's continuous.

"The so-called ""transgender"" has an intellectual problem, not one of ""feeling"" something, because, as I already explained to you IG, no one knows what it ""feels"" like to be someone of a sex other than one's own. You can only imagine it, but the imagination is not a cause of simple truth about reality.      So all so called ""transgender"" people are intellectually confused for varied and complex reasons. The evil transgender industry relies upon and encourages this confusion.      A person very close to me had a ""sex change"" operation. I tried to stop him. Years later, he said that he had made a mistake (this is actually common). He thanked me for having tried to stop him. Years after that, he killed himself as a response to the barren life he had set himself up for in his confused choice to follow the evil industry's guidance (suicide is also common in so- called transgenders).      You have dodged my true comment on your use of ""stable"". And of course it is not in the slightest ""consistent"" with reality to act as if you can become a normal woman, attractive to a normal male, by emasculating yourself and going from there without actually entering into a barren and relatively lonely life, cats and other animals, for the most part becoming your intimate companions.

"That could only serve to increase the wage gap as it will encourage a lot of people who would otherwise go into lucrative trades to get useless degrees (because hey it’s free) and just delay working by four years. So there is no guarantee it would have the intended effect.      But more importantly, that would be pure consequentialism.

"I am an eternalist. I think it's OK for the accidents of a substance to be located at a time where the substance does not exist. In one sense this isn't, however, a case of the accidents existing without the substance, because when the accidents exist presently, the substance exists, too, albeit pastly.      As for consubstantiation, here are some worries.      1\. When Jesus says ""This is my body"", it seems like he is pointing to the visible thing, namely bread. If there is bread there, then he is pointing at the bread. Thus, if there is bread there, he is making the incorrect or at least non-literal statement that that thing, the bread, is his body. But the Tradition likes to take Jesus's words here literally.      2\. According to Scripture and Tradition, we eat Christ's body and drink his blood. But on a consubstantiation view, it's not clear that this is the right way to describe it. It seems that what we really eat and drink is the co- present bread and wine, and the body and blood just happens to come along with it. Here's my image of consubstantiation. Suppose that magnetic fields are substances. Then where there is a magnet, we have something like consubstantiation: there are two substances, a magnet and a magnetic field, in the same place (I am talking of the magnetic field inside the magnet, not the one that extends outside of it). But suppose now you foolishly eat the magnet (DON'T DO IT; children have died from eating two magnets and having them pinch through intenstines). I don't think it's correct to say that you eat both substances.

"One can only concur. In a recent article “The Great Convergence”, Davis asserts: “… the Orthodox need more popery and Catholics need less… the West needs to remember that our bishops do not derive their authority from the pope”. Davis’ “solution” to the schism: “Both the Orthodox and the Catholics would call the pope the primus inter pares. What’s more, everywhere I look now, I see signs that traditional Catholics are moving closer toward the Orthodox position (in a good way)” Perhaps if he left the Vigano/Pietro Siffi cheer squad, his adoring eyes would see something else – there are more than a billion Catholics out there after all. But then, he doesn’t believe there are any doctrinal differences with non-Catholic Orthodoxy (revealing his own lack of orthodoxy), claiming it’s just to do with the way we “do” theology.      He says the Catholic Church is better than the Orthodox in that it is less “ethnic”, but could not resist this: “I did once get some dirty looks for showing up at a Spanish-language Mass in a D.C. ghetto”. Vile. What a way to speak of the Church that welcomed him a few years ago; this “ghetto” of Hispanic Catholicism now includes most US Catholics. What goes on in their parishes is culturally speaking, a window into 1960s liberal US Catholicism.      Yes, as he finds the Catholic Church stinky, exotic folk-religion and “decentralised” local churches are a greener grass. What he can’t explain is how, since the vast majority of “local” churches are pretty liberal, giving them “autonomy” will result in the restoration of orthodox Catholicism. The answer would be obvious to any normal Catholic: pray and work for the re- emergence of the Papacy that has overseen the years of glories he dismisses as “300 years” of “ultramontanism”. He can’t wait for the “great convergence” with non-Catholic churches to happen, he says. But he, and people with his views, are not part of the discussion on how to “restore” ANYTHING.

"@ Victor Torley,      We are speaking at opposed purposes, not cross-purposes.      :-)      ""the intrinsic properties of elementary particles (such as quarks and electrons) [...] do not change when particles are bound in a structure""      In quantum mechanics the properties and existence of a particle is known only through observed interactions with other particles and these interactions are certainly different when the particle is bound then it is when it is free, so it is merely semantics whether you call it the same particle or a different particle that is found by probing. It definitely has different properties. ""Intrinsic properties"" are properties with reference to ""self"" and are not directly accessible but are inferred by extrinsic measurement, which changes, as I said, when the probe is into a bound system versus into relatively free particles. A free particle is _potentially_ a bound particle if it can be taken up into the bound system (see that word root ""potential"" there and think of Aquinas when you do).      Another difficulty with your view is explaining how unique particles, like red blood cells (they are not identical), to which quantum mechanics also must apply, could be probed experimentally at all for fit with the laws of quantum mechanics. Red blood cells also exist in superpositions of states, but since each RBC is unique, there is no way to test its interactions for interference.      I spoke of a golf ball being in a different state after being knocked from a tee. Note that the state, when it is flying, is one which it is only potentially in before it is hit. It certainly has different properties which it only potentially had before being sent flying. Get in the way of the flying ball. It hurts, but the ball sitting on the tee doesn't.      Your propositional distributive law is not about intrinsic properties either. Particles behave. They do not do logic calculations with propositions. Your propositional distributive law is something that exists in our minds, not in particles.

"Yes, there does seem to be a problem in referring to the consequent as ""following from"" the false antecedent. Certainly the consequent isn't being _caused by_ the antecedent.      One of the other problems is that the ""proof"" of the consequent always runs through a statement or series of statements that _hold in normal conditions_ , but it is unclear that they ALSO hold in conditions that obtain with the false antecedent. In the above example given by our esteemed Anonymous above, if we assume 1=2, does it STILL remain true that ""equals subtracted from equals make equals"", which he uses to get the second step? Maybe not. So then you have to hypothesize not only ""1=2"" but also ""and all the usual rules of arithmetic remain valid"". But that, of course, is the difficulty: if 1=2, it seems unlikely that we can simply ""let"" all the other rules remain intact.

"The remaining (and in my view more interesting) point made by Aquinas is this. There is a tendency toward decline in human history, such that “men's knowledge of God [begins] to grow dim and their morals lax.” This is why God had to send a succession of prophets to restore things, such as Abraham and Moses – and, finally, Christ, who effected a much greater restoration precisely by virtue of his Incarnation. “But if this remedy had been put off till the end of the world,” Aquinas says, “all knowledge and reverence of God and all uprightness of morals would have been swept away from the earth.”",remaining view interesting point made aquinas tendency toward decline human history “ men knowledge god begin grow dim moral lax ” god send succession prophet restore thing abraham moses – finally christ effected much greater restoration precisely virtue incarnation “ but remedy put till end world ” aquinas say “ all knowledge reverence god uprightness moral would swept away earth ”,feser,600,0,38

She would not care whether they exceeded some arbitrary threshold for belief. She would be similarly untroubled by the lottery paradox. But no one in practice is a thorough Bayesian, or even close.

We imagine a “before” time and a “beyond” space, but of course both of those are incorrectly applying relative terms to the absolute. We do know that God started time and space, and is at times present at particular points within time and space, but applying the ‘block universe’ of General Relativity onto God is in no way reasonable, as He is the living beginning and end.      The fact that, at the most fundamental perspective, there is no space or time, is not really relevant to us (outside of mystical experience), or to Gods ongoing plan for our creation. We were created in time and space, and the plan is temporal and spatial. The trinity seems to be an important part of the way in which God acts in space and time, but essentially we only see and really conceive of this less fundamental ‘level’, within which God sometimes allows or makes His-eternal-self present.

"Vincent, why some people are in anguish and despair when tortured, while others find themselves in the same state although enjoying all the pleasures the earth has to offer, is the drama that is human life. It's well-known that many early Christians gave up the faith when threatened with persecution but this doesn't detract from the greatness of the sacrifice of so many others. If one cannot put up a coherent case against the Christian understanding of suffering, original sin and Redemption, it does not do much good to think forever and gloomily about suffering. The effort would be better spent thinking about heaven.      Evil is not ""natural"" or part of the divine plan. Men deprived of the benefits of original justice are not in a merely natural state, according to St. Thomas:      (Ia IIae 109): ""We may speak of man in two ways: first, in the state of perfect nature [state of nature]; secondly, in the state of corrupted nature. Now in the state of perfect nature, man, without habitual grace, could avoid sinning either mortally or venially; since to sin is nothing else than to stray from what is according to our nature - and in the state of perfect nature man could avoid this...

"@ Walter Van den Acker,      I am not able to say much now because we have an apparently frozen septic field and brown water in our basement. We may even have to move into a hotel for a while.      ""If a random number contains it if it's long enough then it obviously can be reduced to a random number.""      If you regard it as nothing but a random sequence, sure, it's nothing but a random sequence. But regarded as a model or image of a mind, it's more than that. Regarded as a simple image of God, it is hidden from us, it contains everything expressible, finite or infinite, within the limits of the model (e.g., it is not a sequence of real numbers, etc.), and it is indeterminate so that a human mind may or may not find something in it as the XOR process shows. You should regard computation to a computer's output devices similarly as a model of a human mind as impacted by the sequence.      By ""indeterminate"" I mean something _like_ that it is not a specific random sequence but something _like_ that it is all of them superimposed. The XOR process and the discussion about how _predetermined_ meaning could be anything even though the sequence is random illustrates that. You see, it is not the specificity of a particular sequence that matters. It is that it is random. The randomness is not a bug. It is a feature of the model.      A random sequence can be generated by a physical process according to quantum physics, at least a finite random sequence can, but as the output of an observed nuclear decay interval sequence or something like that, it is indeed just a random sequence with no further meaning. That process just shows that there is such a thing as what we can call a random sequence.      Mathematicians find the idea hard or impossible even to define from pure mathematical ideas. A definition is a rule and a rule defeats randomness. As a _model_ of a real mind, however, the model mind's process as a non-specified random sequence imbues it with meaning. I can't say that the model is a specific observed nuclear decay interval sequence, but the XOR process shows how such a non-specific number could work. Nuclear decay intervals cannot generate infinite random sequences either. I just have to assume the existence of infinite random sequences.      ""Nor do I see the relevance of 'the impossibility of knowing what agents with free will will do that will convert their mental phenomena into tangible acts.'""      Forget that paragraph. It is not really part of the model. I was trying to show a similarity with Professor Feser's article on Davies' book.

" _Is that swapping of caps problematic on your view?_      No, this is no problem for me: I **expressly said** that if the pope (or any other bishop) gives a caveat that makes it clear that they ARE NOT intending their comment to be taken as ""official"" or not as from them qua _teacher_ , it is not magisterial. (It may have been in the prior post that I said this. Not sure which one.)      _I'm reading you (maybe) as saying or implying that the assertions of a pope in faith or morals cannot fail to be 'binding' on any Catholic to some extent, whether the pope likes it or not; or maybe that this is so, at least by default._      I am saying that the ""bindingness"" is a matter of degree, just as is the _intention_ and the _manner in which the intention is expressed_ are manifestly capable of degree. All commentators agree that there are different levels of authoritativeness to different kinds of papal documents, from Apostolic Constitutions through encyclicals and such, down to other actions. And all agree that the pope can emphasize his teaching with different levels of formality and different levels of insistence. Just reading through JPII's encyclicals gives you a wide range of statements he makes that land at widely different levels of insistence that Catholics be guided by his teaching. It's not an on/off switch, with nothing in between.      _his 'manifest will' refers especially to his intention to teach and bind the faithful of the world. Normally he will not express this intention in so many words, but it can be known 'either from the character of the documents, from his frequent repetition of the same doctrine, or from his manner of speaking.'_      These last points, i.e. _markers_ of the pope's intention, clearly are of the kind that are capable of degree. Especially ""frequent repetition of the same doctrine"" - if the pope (and the Church) want frequent repetition to be used as a marker, it is necessarily the case that a teaching pass **_only gradually_** from ""newly proposed"" to ""long-standing teaching"" by which the Church expresses ""we're serious about this..."".",swapping cap problematic view problem expressly said pope bishop give caveat make clear intending comment taken official qua teacher magisterial may prior post said sure one reading maybe saying implying assertion pope faith moral can not fail binding catholic extent whether pope like maybe least default saying bindingness matter degree intention manner intention expressed manifestly capable degree commentator agree different level authoritativeness different kind papal document apostolic constitution encyclical action agree pope emphasize teaching different level formality different level insistence reading encyclical give wide range statement make land widely different level insistence catholic guided teaching onoff switch nothing manifest refers especially intention teach bind faithful world normally express intention many word known either character document frequent repetition doctrine manner speaking last point ie marker intention clearly kind capable degree especially frequent repetition doctrine - pope church want frequent repetition used marker necessarily case teaching pas gradually newly proposed long-standing teaching church express serious,feser,2108,0,61
"Hi toni. Your comment seems to support mine. You say that, if there is disagreement among the bishops, the only practical infallible organ is a General Council confirmed by the Pope or an ex cathedra statement. However, as I mentioned, such declarations do not merely amount to infallible statements concerning the history of the ordinary magisterium of the bishops. They do rely on tradition, of course, but the cruncher in any infallible declaration is that it is part of the faith revealed by God, as Pius IX and Pius XII said, immediately prefacing their dogmatic defini-tions. Tradition is the keeping of the faith whose revelation ended with the death of the last Apostle. Obviously the Church cannot lose the faith, but the final arbiter of what that faith is, is the Papacy and General Councils con-firmed by it. When it comes to tradition, the Church of Rome which alone as Pius IX said, has never lost the faith, must carry more weight than parts of the Catholic Church.",hi toni comment seems support mine say disagreement among bishop practical infallible organ general council confirmed pope ex cathedra statement however mentioned declaration merely amount infallible statement concerning history ordinary magisterium bishop rely tradition course cruncher infallible declaration part faith revealed god pius ix pius xii said immediately prefacing dogmatic defini-tions tradition keeping faith whose revelation ended death last apostle obviously church can not lose faith final arbiter faith papacy general council con-firmed come tradition church rome alone pius ix said never lost faith must carry weight part catholic church,feser,980,0,62

"The knowledge that God exists, i.e., that He is actual, is certainly not a matter of faith: understanding that God exists requires no faith but is very simple knowledge accessible to all honest people, where by honest we define people who do not declare false the true or true the false.   From a logical point of view, the existence of God is not an axiom, in that it is not a self-evident statement in itself; it is not a hypothesis for the excellent reasons developed by Prof Feser; it is not a conjecture in that it is not a judgment based on non-evidential data: the existence of God is a reality that is logically proven, that is, it is a theorem, that is, grounded in logic, but also one that can be intuited by anyone, even without the pedantic and explicit use of formal logical reasoning.   I refer, for example, to the work of Christoph Benzmüller (preprint arXiv:2202.06264, 2022) for the very short proof and I limit myself to quote here the three axioms he uses:   (1) for any entity the lack of any property is not positive, (2) any property caused by another positive property is necessarily also a positive property, (3) ""being divine"" is a positive property.   The discussion is thus to be centered not on the existence of God as such but on the meaning of each of these axioms in our real world.   As Feser himself well points out, only considerations of necessity, and never of contingency as such, can lead to the truth of the claim of God's existence.

"@ Walter Van den Acker,      ""I have [n]ever tarred and feathered the Catholic Church but I have often criticised it, with arguments""      Oh well, then, Walter, the Catholic Church has also never tarred and feathered anyone, not even metaphorically, as it is an institution and never does anything to people except through good spiritual influences. Bad things done by members of the Church are done through their free will choices as individual people. The Church per se would not be criticised by right thinking Christians, so your longstanding criticisms of the Church must be from the point of view of someone outside of it, yet you are apparently a baptised Christian fallen so far from your faith that you deny it.

"Not a fan   Indeed, ""Aristotle Was Not Wrong about Everything"". Is that a reasonable basis to be an Aristotelian? Not wrong about everything?      Even where his conclusions were wrong Aristotle made great progress by engaging in a process of observation, organization of data, and publishing his reasoning for his theories.      Unfortunately, Aristotle was pretty much all wrong about physics. About all he got right were a few trivial observations. Modern physics has falsified Aristotelian physics, and therefore the First Way of Aquinas, which is based on Aristotelian physics.      The Aristotelian arguments for a first mover depend on the notion that motion requires an external mover in the present moment. Modern physics has scientifically falsified that notion, thus the First Way has been scientifically falsified. No amount of cherry-picked trivial associations between Aristotle and modern observations can alter the simple fact that the argument for a first mover is based on a fundamental error of Aristotle.      I am not familiar with your asserted unreasonable criticisms of Aristotelian logic by Bertrand Russel, fine, that is not what I was referring to with respect to the ways Russel pointed out the errors of Aristotle.      Russel provided further explanation as to why the Aristotelian argument for a first mover is wrong, especially in his writings about mutual interactions. Aquinas pointed to the need for successive movers which cannot rationally go to infinity, which is a very good point. What Russel explained is that movers do not regress in a linear hierarchy, rather, movers interact mutually in a circular mutual process, thus terminating finitely the regression of movers Aquinas called for.      In modern physics material is conserved, as expressed in the famous equation E=mc^2. Feser above calls for a first sustainer, yet modern physics and simple logic call for just the opposite. If X amount of material remains after time passes that is no change in the amount of existent material, therefore no first changer, no first sustainer, is called for.      Feser has this clear and simple logic back to front.      If material were to blink out of existence, then that would be a change calling for a changer. So, Feser seems to imagine an unseen changer continuously changing material back from spontaneously changing itself out of existence so that we observe no change.      Further, Feser has, from time to time, described this notion of material simply blinking out of existence absent a sustainer. Thus, Feser advocates that Aquinas was wrong in stating in the First Way ""It is therefore impossible that in the same respect and in the same way a thing should be both mover and moved, i.e. that it should move itself."" Clearly, if a material thing were to blink itself out of existence it would ""move"" (change) itself from existing to not existing.      Modern physics has scientifically falsified Aristotelian physics, thus, modern physics has falsified the Five Ways of Aquinas, which are based on Aristotelian (false) physics. Modern physics has scientifically falsified the A-T notions of a first sustainer, revealing such notions to be incoherent. Attempts by Koons and Feser to somehow find vindication of Aristotle in modern physics are confused, erroneous, and misguided at best.",fan indeed aristotle wrong everything reasonable basis aristotelian wrong everything even conclusion wrong aristotle made great progress engaging process observation organization data publishing reasoning theory unfortunately aristotle pretty much wrong physic got right trivial observation modern physic falsified aristotelian physic therefore first way aquinas based aristotelian physic aristotelian argument first mover depend notion motion requires external mover present moment modern physic scientifically falsified notion thus first way scientifically falsified amount cherry-picked trivial association aristotle modern observation alter simple fact argument first mover based fundamental error aristotle familiar asserted unreasonable criticism aristotelian logic bertrand russel fine referring respect way russel pointed error aristotle russel provided explanation aristotelian argument first mover wrong especially writing mutual interaction aquinas pointed need successive mover can not rationally go infinity good point russel explained mover regress linear hierarchy rather mover interact mutually circular mutual process thus terminating finitely regression mover aquinas called modern physic material conserved expressed famous equation emc feser call first sustainer yet modern physic simple logic call opposite x amount material remains time pass change amount existent material therefore first changer first sustainer called feser clear simple logic back front material blink existence would change calling changer feser seems imagine unseen changer continuously changing material back spontaneously changing existence observe change feser time time described notion material simply blinking existence absent sustainer thus feser advocate aquinas wrong stating first way therefore impossible respect way thing mover moved ie move clearly material thing blink existence would move change existing existing modern physic scientifically falsified aristotelian physic thus modern physic falsified five way aquinas based aristotelian false physic modern physic scientifically falsified a-t notion first sustainer revealing notion incoherent attempt koons feser somehow find vindication aristotle modern physic confused erroneous misguided best,feser,3332,0,71

"I think this discussion is quite useful. As recent Popes have not taught heresy per se, and it seems no Pope ever has, the rationale for resisting some wishes of a Pope does not have to be because they have fallen into heresy, but simply because his every wish or thought is not infallible. It's also true that being mistaken, or taking actions that are extremely harmful to the Church do not mean the Pope has become a heretic (or, on the view of some, he is not a Pope).      There have been a number of responses to the confusion since Vatican II. One, championed by the Opus Dei, for example, makes every effort to remain orthodox, while putting what the Pope does in the best possible light, generally not criticizing other parts of the Church, but speaking and working behind the scenes. This has made it possible for them to do a lot of good work.      Another response has been that of Archbishop Lefebvre and the Saint Pius X Society. They have loudly attacked aspects of Vatican II (which they say must be authoritatively interpreted in the light of the traditional teachings of the Popes), and refused the accept the new liturgy. In order for them to do this, Archbishop Lefebvre consecrated four bishops against the wishes of Rome. At the same time, he and his congregation have never suggested any changes to the structure of the Church. They are Roman to the core, they simply believe that the Popes since Vatican II have made some big mistakes (that do not affect their infallibility) that warrant not being followed.      Lately there seems to be a third position that should be worrying orthodox Catholics. It consists in, not just challenging the current Pope or refusing to recognize him, but a plan for a new Church structure. Here are a couple of recent examples.      One is from John Lamont, in a debate featured on the Rorate Caeli site: ""An admission that Pope Francis is a heretic destroys this cult-like understanding of the Church. It requires the Catholic faithful to exercise their faith in the words of Our Lord on their own, without the instruction of their bishops..."" Secondly, this excerpt from an article by Peter Kwasniewski, where he argues, incongruously, for traditionalists not to leave the Church: "" if a pope says that all that I love about the Latin Church is “rigid” and “nostalgic” and “out of date” and “closed off to surprises” and whatever other nonsense he comes out with, I will know that he is in the devil’s pay, since no pope who was a believer in Christ and a practicing Catholic would ever speak thus..."". What Pope Francis is supposed to have done here is very far from heresy. Will we be next be told that he used a diabolical number of fingers to make the sign of the cross.      Kwasniewski says he could not leave because Orthodoxy is a different ""flesh and blood tradition and that his home is the West. It seems to me that he ignores the many attempts that have been made to create Western Orthodoxies. I believe we might be witnessing another of these. By ""staying"" in the West physically, but teaching an ecclesiology that is not Catholic, this group looks more like the modernists who persisted in undermining the Church from within. It might be very wrong to call liturgical traditionalism nostalgia, but attacking the structure of the Catholic Church is much worse.",think discussion quite useful recent pope taught heresy per se seems pope ever rationale resisting wish pope fallen heresy simply every wish thought infallible also true mistaken taking action extremely harmful church mean pope become heretic view pope number response confusion since vatican ii one championed opus dei example make every effort remain orthodox putting pope best possible light generally criticizing part church speaking working behind scene made possible lot good work another response archbishop lefebvre saint pius x society loudly attacked aspect vatican ii say must authoritatively interpreted light traditional teaching pope refused accept new liturgy order archbishop lefebvre consecrated four bishop wish rome time congregation never suggested change structure church roman core simply believe pope since vatican ii made big mistake affect infallibility warrant followed lately seems third position worrying orthodox catholic consists challenging current pope refusing recognize plan new church structure couple recent example one john lamont debate featured rorate caeli site admission pope francis heretic destroys cult-like understanding church requires catholic faithful exercise faith word lord without instruction bishop secondly excerpt article peter kwasniewski argues incongruously traditionalist leave church pope say love latin church “ rigid ” “ nostalgic ” “ out date ” “ closed surprise ” whatever nonsense come know pay since pope believer christ practicing catholic would ever speak thus pope francis supposed done far heresy next told used diabolical number finger make sign cross kwasniewski say could leave orthodoxy different flesh blood tradition home west seems ignores many attempt made create western orthodoxy believe might witnessing another staying west physically teaching ecclesiology catholic group look like modernist persisted undermining church within might wrong call liturgical traditionalism nostalgia attacking structure catholic church much worse,feser,3333,0,73

The Pope can certainly err in his non-infallible pronouncements, but I disagree that the Magisterium - and Dr. Feser argues that his letters here are a part of the Magisterium (I am not convinced) - can ever teach heresy as defined by Vatican I, because then the Magisterium would be leading believers off the path of salvation.

"The consequence of this is that scientists often end up supposing that precision is possible where really it is not. Or, because a concept’s application may be susceptible of precision in one, limited domain, scientists can fallaciously suppose that it must be equally capable of precision when extended beyond that domain. This is, Cartwright argues, especially likely in social science. She gives as an example the notion of _probability_. When we consider simple examples like pulling cards from a fair deck, the probabilities of various possible outcomes can be determined with precision. But it simply doesn’t follow that we can meaningfully assign probabilities to events in general, and Cartwright thinks there are good reasons to suppose that this is not in fact possible.",consequence scientist often end supposing precision possible really application may susceptible precision one limited domain scientist fallaciously suppose must equally capable precision extended beyond domain cartwright argues especially likely social science give example notion probability consider simple example like pulling card fair deck probability various possible outcome determined precision simply follow meaningfully assign probability event general cartwright think good reason suppose fact possible,feser,780,0,82
"Regarding the council of Orange and semi-pelagianism: Here again, this assertion reflects a high level of confidence and a high level of ignorance mixed in a toxic cocktail. Pelagianism is a heresy. And Church councils condemn heresy, rather than upholding a moderated version of heresy (i.e. semi-heresy).Semi-pelagianism, which is imprecise and often undefined, denies the role of God's grace in the initial movement of the will toward God. This is denied by both the Council of Orange and St. Augustine. In fact it is condemned by the Council of Orange as heresy. So, the council of Orange *nowhere* condemned St. Augustine. It did however condemn a version of the very same heresy that St. Augustine fought so tirelessly against.      Now, the key here for anyone who cares about orthodoxy is that heresy and orthodoxy are not defined by the self-appointed pope WCB. It is defined by the Church that the Scripture's refer to as ""the pillar and foundation of truth"" and which Christ said ""the gates of hell will not prevail against it"". Satan is the father of lies and where lies prevail (e.g. in the thought of WCB), there Satan prevails. This has not and cannot happen in Christ's Church which is the pillar and foundation of truth. So, as I mentioned below, WCB, no one here is interested in joining the cult of WCB. Your judgements are pervasively erroneous and you should consider tempering that unflinching confidence in your own wisdom. Trusting that rickety old bridge is going to lead you to fall into a pit.      As a final note to the interested reader, it is not enough to read Scripture and quote it. We have to interpret it correctly and there is such a thing as a heretical interpretation (for examples of this, review the writings of WCB). Pelagius was, after all, not reading the funny papers when he arrived at his position that ""there was when the word was not"". He was reading the book of Proverbs and offering a heretical interpretation of this book (He also wrote a commentary on Romans.). So, it is not enough to quote Scripture. Satan quoted Scripture. You have to interpret it truly with the pillar and foundation of truth and this involves submitting to the judgements of Church councils which are under the guidance of the Holy Spirit as we see in Acts 15 from St. James' words (""it seemed good to us and to the Holy Spirit"") as the council sent out letters to the Churches notifying all Christians of the decision of the council. They did not say, ""well take a bible--if your literate--and decide what you think on this issue and, if you are not literate, just follow whoever is most able to convince you with ""smooth and flattering words that will ""tickle your ears"" (two quotes from Scripture, I will leave to the reader to look them up). Instead, everyone knew that they must obey the judgement of the leaders of the Church at the Jerusalem council. After all, Hebrews teaches, ""Obey your leaders"". It is for this reason that they did not say, ""Let me see what you think about that and then I will decide whether or not you got it right."" That would be the arrogant and foolish approach of WCB. Instead, they received the letter with joy and docility because they understood the teaching of Scripture: ""Obey your leaders.""",regarding council orange semi-pelagianism assertion reflects high level confidence high level ignorance mixed toxic cocktail pelagianism heresy church council condemn heresy rather upholding moderated version heresy ie semi-heresysemi-pelagianism imprecise often undefined denies role grace initial movement toward god denied council orange st augustine fact condemned council orange heresy council orange nowhere condemned st augustine however condemn version heresy st augustine fought tirelessly key anyone care orthodoxy heresy orthodoxy defined self-appointed pope wcb defined church refer pillar foundation truth christ said gate hell prevail satan father lie lie prevail eg thought wcb satan prevails can not happen church pillar foundation truth mentioned wcb one interested joining cult wcb judgement pervasively erroneous consider tempering unflinching confidence wisdom trusting rickety old bridge going lead fall pit final note interested reader enough read scripture quote interpret correctly thing heretical interpretation example review writing wcb pelagius reading funny paper arrived position word reading book proverb offering heretical interpretation book also wrote commentary roman enough quote scripture satan quoted scripture interpret truly pillar foundation truth involves submitting judgement church council guidance holy spirit see act st word seemed good u holy spirit council sent letter church notifying christian decision council say well take bible -- if literate -- and decide think issue literate follow whoever able convince smooth flattering word tickle ear two quote scripture leave reader look instead everyone knew must obey judgement leader church jerusalem council hebrew teach obey leader reason say let see think decide whether got right would arrogant foolish approach wcb instead received letter joy docility understood teaching scripture obey leader,feser,3256,0,83

" _it does NOT teach that, and the matter can [be], and is discussed by theologians;_      The fact that the Church is perfectly fine with theologians _discussing_ the matter, i.e. debating it, holding opposing views, with neither side being reprimanded, by that very fact means that      **The Church does not teach** that _the Pope cannot err in non-ex-cathedra teaching_. That is to say, while a Catholic in good standing may think it is true that the pope cannot err in non-ex-cathedra teaching, he cannot represent that his opinion is ""The Church's position"" on it, not at this time. If the Church ever decides to refine this issue so as to take a definite position and ""define"" on it, then of course there will no longer be room for theologians to debate it. But until then, the fact that theologians are free to debate it means that the Church _does not teach_ one definite answer to the question.      To take it a step further: one of the proposed ""solutions"" to ""pope's cannot err on faith and morals"" - in the face of a manifest case of error by John XXII - is that a pope who issues forth such an error, by that very fact, loses his papacy, and the see becomes vacant. (A variant of this opinion reserves this loss to cases where the pope tries to teach heresy, which is of course a narrower subset of error.)

But this does not seem to be relevant to an observer measuring only the spin of one of a pair of entangled particles and by so doing knowing the spin of the other.      The classicist could claim that since we know that the particles can only have 1 of 2 spin states and since they are entangled, the pair will have opposite spin states (due to conservation of momentum) during their trajectories to the detectors but we won't know which is up and which is down till at least one is detected and then the state of the other is known. The classicist makes the same accurate conclusion from the measurement results from one detector as the QM theorist. Neither requires superluminal information transfer so there is no paradox in either case.      Again. Where is the paradox supposed to be here?      The only disagreement is about what is **really** happening until the first measurement. But **really** finding out would require a measurement before the detector and that makes the disagreement unresolvable in principle.      Maybe I have a misunderstanding of the entire entanglement story. Let me lay out my understanding point by point and talk about some issues I see.   1) Entangled particle pairs differ from non-entangled particle pairs in that when measuring non-entangled particles there is no correlation between their 2 possible spin states while there is a correlation between the 2 possible spin states of entangled particle pairs. The correlation of entangled particle pairs is complementary in that if one is measured as up, the other is always measured as down (as in pi-meson decay)      2) In the case of pi-meson decay, each particle must have complementary spin to preserve conservation of momentum.      3) Experimentally we always observe that entangled particles behave this way.      It seems to me that if some new experiments come up with different results, we have to conclude at least one of several things.      A. Something is wrong with the experiment:   The particles weren't entangled in the first place.   The measurement devices were not set properly or were incapable of measuring accurately.   Something unknown interfered with the experiment.   There was an error in math when interpreting the results.      B: Our theory is wrong   We don't understand how entanglement works and so cannot reliably entangle pairs.   We don't understand how our measurement devices work.   Conservation of momentum is wrong.      I think it's a bigger story if QM does away with conservation of momentum.

"Here's a passage from Pope John Paul II's Encyclical Redemptor hominis, suggesting that babies have sanctifying grace in their souls when those children still live in the womb. If they do, why baptize them?      ""Accordingly, what is in question here is man in all his truth, in his full magnitude. We are not dealing with the ""abstract"" man, but the real, ""concrete"", ""historical"" man. We are dealing with ""each"" man, for each one is included in the mystery of the Redemption and with each one Christ has united himself for ever through this mystery. Every man comes into the world through being conceived in his mother's womb and being born of his mother, and precisely on account of the mystery of the Redemption is entrusted to the solicitude of the Church. Her solicitude is about the whole man and is focussed on him in an altogether special manner. The object of her care is man in his unique unrepeatable human reality, which keeps intact the image and likeness of God himself92. The Council points out this very fact when, speaking of that likeness, it recalls that ""man is the only creature on earth that God willed for itself""93. Man as ""willed"" by God, as ""chosen"" by him from eternity and called, destined for grace and glory-this is ""each"" man, ""the most concrete"" man, ""the most real""; this is man in all the fullness of the mystery in which he has become a sharer in Jesus Christ, the mystery in which each one of the four thousand million human beings living on our planet has become a sharer from the moment he is conceived beneath the heart of his mother.""      https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp- ii_enc_04031979_redemptor-hominis.html      Does his belief imply something like universalism?

"It saddens me to read how catholic thinkers, not most of them thank goodness, but many, have hitched their wagon to villainizing CRT in the misbegotten attempt of thinking that such a strategy will drag Catholic thought into the mainstream from the periphery, the nether regions of contemporary philosophy where it has gravitated in the last 50 years.

"Okay now to address your scenario. You are asking whether the scenario you describe is possible. Here we have to make a distinction between something being logically possible and something that is actually the case. The scenario you describe is logically possible in the same way that it is logically possible that God could have made unicorns. However, framing it this way and then going on to say that we should hope for this is analagous to suggesting that we should hope for the existence of unicorns.      The question is not whether it is logically possible in the strict sense. The question is: what from reason or revelation has led you to think that this is in fact the case? After we have all listened to the crickets for a bit, we should be able to move on from this question. Instead we have to put up with folks bending their will to find any figure within the tradition who will agree with their foregone conclusions.      Their approach is not: what is the weight of Tradition on this question. Their question is: can I find anyone who agrees with me. Their question is not: how do I operate within the stream of Tradition making sense of all of Scripture in light of Tradition and especially in light of the greatest figures in the Tradition (doctors like St. Thomas, St. Augustine, etc.). Rather their approach is: how close can I get to affirming something as close to universalism as possible without actually committing myself to propositions that have been explicitly condemned. This is *NOT* a catholic approach to theology.      The problem, however, is even greater than what I have described. It is not that they have neither reason nor revelation supporting their position and they choose to believe it anyways. That would be irrational. However something more is occurring. They actually have both Scripture affirming that few will find eternal life and the greatest doctors of the Church understanding that passage in its very obvious sense and they reject this testimony or explain it away. Again, that is *not* a Catholic approach to theology.      And contrary to the calumnious suggestions otherwise, the concern of those who are speaking out against these trends is ""pastoral"". Those speaking against these trends (e.g. Ralph Martin in his book Will Many Be Saved? and Edward Feser and Fr. Rooney and the Popes who have repeatedly warned about indifferentism) are motivated precisely out of love for those drawn into indifference over sin because of these dangerous opinions. Hard to get people to suffer the embarrassment of a good confession if they think that everyone is going to heaven regardless.

"Hi Tom      The sentence in which I used novelty merely emphasized the point of these posts namely to demonstrate that it is possible for a pope to commit heresy and it has happened before.      Here's what I said      ""hence the urgency to show that it is possible for a Pope to commit heresy so that it isn't seen as some kind of novelty""      In this very post he mentions      ""The lessons of the case of Honorius are clear. When a pope is not speaking ex cathedra, it is possible for him to fall into error. ""      To quote Prof. Feser from twitter while he was replying to someone who questioned that the arguments in this post are also used by heretical catholics (sedes, liberals) to habitually disagree with Papal statements      ""But there are also people whose faith is shaken because they think they're expected to swallow that which contradicts past doctrine. There's a danger in not addressing that worry by keeping silent about the possibility of legitimate disagreement merely because some abuse it.""      It doesn't seem that I said anything different, danger implies urgency.      As for what you mentioned about the abuse scandals, personally, I feel it's a bit uncharitable to lay all of the blame at the feet of Pope Francis, 99% of the all the abuse took place preceding this papacy and were just revealed during this papacy, obviously there have been some hush ups which should be criticised but those same kind of cover ups took place on a very large scale during Pope St JPII's papacy, And even Pope Benedict was aware of Mccarrick and had already imposed some sanctions. How Prelates may choose to respond to some scandal is a matter of Prudence, prudence maybe wrong at times. There has also been large scale reform though in regards to the issue though, such as making the reporting process easier, efforts to make the process more transparent, candidates to priesthood are also scrutinized to a very high degree, so there has been some positive change.      As for heresy with regards to sexual morality being perpetuated at the highest level, with regards to same sex marriage and blessings of such couples and the like, the document by the CDCF which was put out awhile ago was quite firm, Pope Francis approved it. Is it not better to go by an official statement then by unconfirmed reports of someone reporting what the Pope allegedly told them.      With regards to Amoris Latetia, Orthodox Theologians like Mathew Levering have shown that the texts in doubt can be given an orthodox interpretation. Obviously it would be better if Pope Francis answered the Dubium himself and we could criticise him for that. But that doesn't entail that this issue is such that people have cause to question their faith especially when orthodox   Interpretations have been offered. In the absence of clarification, one ought to charitably go with the orthodox interpretation while respectfully awaiting a reply. If you are someone with a high position in Rome you could even respectfully use your influence to perhaps prompt some response.         As for ""leaving heterodox opinion at the highest levels standing without clear or any correction"", It can even be argued that Pope John Paul II did the same with Walter Kasper by promoting him who evidently has a heretical postion on the very issue of divorce. Pope Benedict XVI while obviously and sternly disagreeing with him on this issue, did appraisingly mention Kasper's book on Christ in the intro to his final books on the new testament and Christ.      Also if I feel that something should be expressed in a particular way, why can't I suggest it, whether it's taken or not is irrelevant and doesn't change my admiration and respect for Prof.      Elon Musk goes after who he wants without fear lol, did you forget that guy who helped save those kids from the cage.

"Second, Davies notes that in order to show that an eternal and immutable God’s act of creation would be unfree, one would have to show that there is something either internal to God’s nature or external to him that compels him to create. But given that the divine nature is as classical theists, on independent grounds, argue it to be (pure actuality, perfect, omnipotent, etc.) there can be no need in God for anything distinct from him, so that nothing in his nature can compel him to create. And since, the classical theist also argues (and again on independent grounds) there is nothing apart from God that God did not create, there can be nothing distinct from him that compels him to create. Hence we cannot make sense of God’s being in any way compelled to create, and thus must attribute freedom to him.",second davy note order show eternal immutable act creation would unfree one would show something either internal nature external compels create given divine nature classical theist independent ground argue pure actuality perfect omnipotent etc need god anything distinct nothing nature compel create since classical theist also argues independent ground nothing apart god god create nothing distinct compels create hence can not make sense way compelled create thus must attribute freedom,feser,811,0,130

"Tom,   In Newtonian mechanics both momentum and energy are conserved, I did not bother going into those details, as I left it to the reader to understand the relationships between velocity, mass, momentum, and kinetic energy.      ""This is just garbage. If two blobs of putty collide and stick, motion is lost in any inertial reference frame.""   No, and this is the core misconception in the A-T argument for the first mover.      Aristotle, Aquinas, Feser, Tom, and most of the good posters here have this point wrong. This ancient error you all continue to hold is at the heart of your misunderstanding.      The kinetic energy of motion of the two blobs of putty is converted into the kinetic energy of motion of the molecules that make up the blobs of putty, what we call heat.      No motion is lost, in the very real sense that matter/energy is considered, that is, the molecular motion of the constituents of the putty increases by an amount equal to the decrease in linear translational motion the blobs of putty started with, in a manner that conserves material (matter/energy).      More extreme examples are kinetic weapons and meteors from space. The motion of these projectiles is never lost, rather, it is transformed into the molecular motion we sense as heat.      That is true of all objects that appear to the human senses to slow and stop. To our immediate senses the motion seems to be lost, and that apparent loss leads one to argue for a first mover.      But, in truth, motion is never lost, only transformed. Thus, no first mover is called for.      At base causality, to the extent that causality is a valid concept at all, is fundamentally circular, not hierarchical.      We don't need a first mover at the base of a hierarchical regress from moved to mover because at base objects move each other in net lossless perpetual mutual interactions that are fundamentally circular, not hierarchical.

"@Tony:      ""I would suggest that the principle only holds within a constrained , limited context, and not absolutely - for the reason that ""equals"" does not inherently mean ""the same in every possible respect"". In the realm of quantity, if you are speaking of one aspect of the two referents x and y, x=y may well imply f(x) = f(y) because you have limited the context of the ""is equal"" itself. But it doesn't hold in every respect if x is not the same as y in every respect. If x is ""8"" and y is ""4 + 4"" and z is ""3 + 5"", then they are not the same in respect of ""expressed as a whole singular"" versus ""expressed as a sum of equal parts"" or ""expressed as a sum of primes""""      The = sign *does* stand for identical; the names in both sides of the sign name the same, identical thing.

I should clarify that I am *not* dismissing any criticisms of first order logic, or even saying that this way of talking is the best way of talking in every possible practical and theoretical subject. To give a simple, obvious example, as far as I know there is no good satisfactory account of intensional contexts. This way of talking entails no contradictions (or at least any obvious ones) and is especially useful in mathematics though; part of the reasons are certainly contingent and reflect the way how mathematicians are trained, but I would contend that they also reflect a deep intuition. Mathematical objects are simple in the sense that their identity conditions are sharp and clearly delineated -- they are the furthest removed from the material. Virtually all of mathematics can be formalized in ZFC, possibly with some extra large cardinal axioms; *equality* itself can be defined in terms of the other primitives (in symbols: x = y iff forall z, z e x <=> z e y). In this setting, we have: (1) *everything* is a set and (2) *everything* can be constructed bottom up from the empty set via (possibly transfinite) iteration. This is a large amount of reduction and simplification, yielding a powerful framework. But to circle back to the criticisms, it also has its downsides. Now suddenly, it make senses to ask the non-sensical question if the number 5 is an element of the number 1023. This question has a definite truth value but its value depends on the specific, non-essential details of the construction of the natural numbers in ZFC.",tony would suggest principle hold within constrained limited context absolutely - reason equal inherently mean every possible respect realm quantity speaking one aspect two referent x xy may well imply fx fy limited context equal hold every respect x every respect x z respect expressed whole singular versus expressed sum equal part expressed sum prime sign stand identical name side sign name identical thing far putative counter-examples would say response longer talking even aspect thing altogether somehow related -- expression tree additive prime decomposition partition whatever else mind clarify dismissing criticism first order logic even saying way talking best way talking every possible practical theoretical subject give simple obvious example far know good satisfactory account intensional context way talking entail contradiction least obvious one especially useful mathematics though part reason certainly contingent reflect way mathematician trained would contend also reflect deep intuition mathematical object simple sense identity condition sharp clearly delineated -- furthest removed material virtually mathematics formalized zfc possibly extra large cardinal axiom equality defined term primitive symbol x iff forall z z e x z e setting everything set everything constructed bottom empty set via possibly transfinite iteration large amount reduction simplification yielding powerful framework circle back criticism also downside suddenly make sens ask non-sensical question number element number question definite truth value value depends specific non-essential detail construction natural number zfc,feser,2648,0,133
"from Prof. Feser's review: 'According to hylomorphism, the parts of a material thing are less fundamental to it than the whole—and, indeed, exist in the whole only as potentially independent things rather than as actual entities in their own right.

"WCB      As a matter of fact I also agree that foreknowledge is ultimately incompatible with free will, and I therefore reject foreknowledge, but I don't think your argument works.      I would respond by saying that you are confusing God's knowledge of an action with its causes. Proponents of foreknowledge would specify that God's knowing what you will freely do is precisely that: God's knowing what you will freely do. His knowledge doesn't cause your choice. Your choice comes first; God knows your choice because it's the choice you make. It's a contingent fact that is ultimately explained by you. God only knows it as a result of you making the choice.      I would also call attention to an important caveat: most proponents of foreknowledge do not actually accept that God ""ALWAYS"" knew everything that would happen, at least not without qualification. God's foreknowledge of creaturely acts is dependent on their existence, God first has to create them ""before"" he can have any knowledge about what they'll do. The one exception to this would be Molinists, who believe that God has ""middle knowledge"" and therefore knows not only future choices but also ""futuribles"" and counterfactuals of freedom. So ""before"" God created the universe that would have Hitler, he did not know (at least not for certain) what Hitler would do. And as soon as God created the universe that would have Hitler in it, it was already ""too late"" and God would know all that would happen (because it would happen).      God's foreknowledge of his own choices is more complicated to discuss. Since God is outside of time, he wouldn't really know ""in advance"" what he would do. There was no ""in advance"" before the creation of temporal things. So even defenders of foreknowledge would probably not accept that God ""foreknew"" what he would create. God just freely chose what to create, and with his choosing God knew what he was choosing, that was all.   As for God's foreknowledge of his ""future interferences"" in creation, one could respond either that it would be the same case as with creatures (God's choice has a priority over the foreknowledge and is not caused by it) or again God has no foreknowledge of himself because he is timeless even in his actions.",wcb matter fact also agree foreknowledge ultimately incompatible free therefore reject foreknowledge think argument work would respond saying confusing knowledge action cause proponent foreknowledge would specify knowing freely precisely knowing freely knowledge cause choice choice come first god know choice choice make contingent fact ultimately explained god know result making choice would also call attention important caveat proponent foreknowledge actually accept god always knew everything would happen least without qualification foreknowledge creaturely act dependent existence god first create knowledge one exception would molinists believe god middle knowledge therefore know future choice also futuribles counterfactuals freedom god created universe would hitler know least certain hitler would soon god created universe would hitler already late god would know would happen would happen foreknowledge choice complicated discus since god outside time really know advance would advance creation temporal thing even defender foreknowledge would probably accept god foreknew would create god freely chose create choosing god knew choosing foreknowledge future interference creation one could respond either would case creature god choice priority foreknowledge caused god foreknowledge timeless even action,feser,2247,0,141

"I agree that some instances of suffering that happen in the world does indeed help us to realise and understand the goodness of God. It manifests his goodness in so far as his mercy is enough to restore even the most broken of souls and we do see examples of this. The way in which God has arranged things does give way to a lot of instances where he brings a greater good out of all the evil that is taken place, the most stark example being the crucifixion which God used to manifest his infinite mercy. Pope John Paul II as well as Thomas Aquinas have both referred to God's mercy has his greatest attribute, that attribute which displays his goodness in the greatest way since God is below no one. And to top it all it was implemented by means of an Incarnation. All these great goods would not have been possible to us in a world without sin even if an Incarnation had taken place in that world because God's mercy would have been conceivable to us only by contemplating the act of creation which would be very abstract. In this world his mercy was on its fullest display. We deserved punishment but God gave us the opposite.   Having said all that though, I think these instances serve to show us that God can indeed bring greater goods out of great evils and we can trust him in that regard. They form parts of the reason why God has permitted suffering. And it's true in a general sense. At the same time there are such ghastly acts that humans commit, that it's hard to believe that God allowed that person to suffer like that just because doesn't want that person to get attached to this world, it's even worse to propose that it was deserved as punishment. In such cases solace should be derived from the fact that even such ghastly trauma can be healed by God's mercy and at the same time refrain from attributing any reason to God for permitting it since we truly aren't in a position to know why. God himself points to our cluelessness in the book of Job.

"@RunDec Yeah, Scotists reject the distinction between essence and existence as being akin to form and matter, and also reject the specific Thomistic ontology this entails.      They view the distinction between essence and existence as a formal distinction because it lacks separability. And that's where the meaningfulness of the formal distinction comes in - it's a real distinction in reality but not such that the things in question have ""their own being"" which would entail separability.      Even if one doesn't think formal distinctions apply to God, they are a real concept.

"@Tony: your answer on Cantus' behalf does not answer the questions I asked. I did not ask for a refutation of materialism; I agreed that materialism has problems.      Cantus was replying to Rafael Nobre, who had asked for reasons to drop his materialism and atheism and ""dive deep into transcendency"". Cantus told Rafael that materialism is a dead-end philosophy that cannot satisfy the human soul. I am still waiting for Cantus to show why ability to ""satisfy the human soul"" provides SUFFICIENT reason for us to adopt a philosophy of ""transcendency"". Rafael seemed to be conflating atheism with materialism and to incline to think that maybe Catholicism is the way to go--at least, he seems to think that dropping materialism will land him in Catholicism.      But since there can be a number of philosophies or systems that ""satisfy,"" it is not clear which one is true, if any are true, from an ability to ""satisfy.""      I'll note by the way that you seem to narrow materialism down to its ""eliminativist"" versions. To point out inconsistencies in a given materialist's discourse does not by itself falsity materialism. That's the problem with retorsion arguments; they usually do not falsify the thesis at which they're aimed, although they can succeed in showing that a proponent of a thesis is being inconsistent.",tony answer behalf answer question asked ask refutation materialism agreed materialism problem cantus replying rafael nobre asked reason drop materialism atheism dive deep transcendency cantus told rafael materialism dead-end philosophy can not satisfy human soul still waiting cantus show ability satisfy human soul provides sufficient reason u adopt philosophy transcendency rafael seemed conflating atheism materialism incline think maybe catholicism way go -- at least seems think dropping materialism land catholicism since number philosophy system satisfy clear one true true ability satisfy note way seem narrow materialism eliminativist version point inconsistency given discourse falsity materialism problem retorsion argument usually falsify thesis aimed although succeed showing proponent thesis inconsistent,feser,1321,0,149
"I have a bone to pick with the reasoning given here:      _And again, “we ought, in this kind of judgment, to aim at judging a man good, unless there is evident proof of the contrary.” To be sure, we might frequently be misled as a result. However, argues Aquinas, this is preferable to the outcome that would follow if we did not give others a presumption of innocence:       **He who interprets doubtful matters for the best, may happen to be deceived more often than not; yet it is better to err frequently through thinking well of a wicked man, than to err less frequently through having an evil opinion of a good man, because in the latter case an injury is inflicted, but not in the former.**_      I suggest: _On the contrary:      “Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. (Matt 5:13      …and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame. (1 Peter 3:16)      If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. (1 Peter 4:14)      No weapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every tongue that accuses you.   This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and this is their vindication from me,” declares the Lord. (Isaiah 54:17)      For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me,   speaking against me with lying tongues. (Ps. 109:2)   But thou, O God my Lord,   deal on my behalf for thy name's sake;   because thy steadfast love is good, deliver me! (Ps. 109:21)   Help me. O Lord my God!   Save me according to thy steadfast love!   Let them know that this is thy hand;   thou, O lord, hast done it!   let them curse, but do thou bless! (Ps. 109:26-28) _      So, arguably, the mere _thought <.i> against a man is not injury to him.      I don't think it is easy to establish the last statement in ""in the latter case, an injury is inflicted, but not in the former."" Let me suggest the opposite: As often as you injure an innocent man when you judge him evil, just as often so also you injure _yourself or others_ when you judge an evil man to be innocent.      To argue this: Let me distinguish: if you judge a man evil when he isn't, but you do not ACT on this opinion in any way, you do not _actually_ injure the man as such. **YOUR** thoughts don’t affect him directly, but only via some further medium. So, the only actual injury he suffers is when you ACT on that opinion. Now, perhaps the first action you might take is to declare your judgment to others and this WOULD be harm to him (in some sense or other, perhaps), but let's eliminate this: it clearly requires not your mere judgment, but your ACT to tell others. The next most likely downstream (harmful) event from that erroneous judgment is that you won't give him some trust on some matter, and this withholding from trust does actually injure him. Any actual harm requires a transfer from your _thought_ into some secondary vehicle that goes outside yourself and impinges on him. UNTIL you have an occasion (such as this withholding trust) to act on your erroneous opinion, you have not actually injured him. However, there are high prospects that there WILL be some such occasion, and so it is _very likely_ that you will injure him. And perhaps this high likelihood is sufficient to say (as a loose approximation) that you ""have"" harmed him in making the judgment. _",bone pick reasoning given “ we ought kind judgment aim judging man good unless evident proof contrary ” sure might frequently misled result however argues aquinas preferable outcome would follow give others presumption innocence interprets doubtful matter best may happen deceived often yet better err frequently thinking well wicked man err le frequently evil opinion good man latter case injury inflicted former suggest contrary “ blessed people insult persecute falsely say kind evil matt …and keep good conscience thing slandered revile good behavior christ put shame peter reviled name christ blessed spirit glory god rest peter weapon forged prevail refute every tongue accuses heritage servant lord vindication me ” declares lord isaiah wicked deceitful mouth opened speaking lying tongue p thou god lord deal behalf thy sake thy steadfast love good deliver p help lord god save according thy steadfast love let know thy hand thou lord hast done let curse thou bless p - arguably mere thought man injury think easy establish last statement latter case injury inflicted former let suggest opposite often injure innocent man judge evil often also injure others judge evil man innocent argue let distinguish judge man evil act opinion way actually injure man thought affect directly via medium actual injury suffers act opinion perhaps first action might take declare judgment others would harm sense perhaps eliminate clearly requires mere judgment act tell others next likely downstream harmful event erroneous judgment give trust matter withholding trust actually injure actual harm requires transfer thought secondary vehicle go outside impinges occasion withholding trust act erroneous opinion actually injured however high prospect occasion likely injure perhaps high likelihood sufficient say loose approximation harmed making judgment,feser,3511,0,150

"WCB      Augustine assures us that God does not in fact cause our choices, God merely knows them. Which is obviously wrong if God creates eveything as it is. Which he also asserts. Creation is eternally happening. Caused by God. See Augustine's ""Confessions - Book XI"". Augustine never took all of this to its logical ends.. He never realized his claim that God did not cause our actions good or bad was logically and rationally wrong.      Augustine had some large conceptual blind spots. Which is theology's basic problem. Of course any theologian who realized this sort of problem confirmed classical theology was nonsense dared not admit it in writing publically. Not unless he find himself pronounced anathema, excommunicated, stripped of any offices he held, and losing any rights to teach in any University if he held a license to teach.

I naturally wonder how many theologians came to realize this sort of theological nonsense was nonsense and simply avoided trouble by not hinting at any of his realizations theology was bunk. Jean Messlier was an example of a well respected priest who scorching opinions were only known posthumously.      Did Augustine abandon free will? Yes. Read the Council of Orange. Which followed Augustine until that turned out to be problematic.      Later, insisting free will was impossible as Augustine suggested became heresy. A monk, Gottshalk of Orbis, who insisted on Augustine's abandoment of free will was censuted and spent 20 years in prison, refusing to abandon that opinion. The Synod of Paris in the tenth century, pronounced that opinion heresy, utterly abandoning the Council Of Orange. Manuscripts about the Gottshalk affair only recently have been gathered and translated. I do not know if these have yet been published.      You might want to read the Council of Orange.      We have very little about the discussions of theologians of the time who realized Augustine's theology made God author and creator of all horrendous evil and suffering forcing abandment of that theology, but that in fact happen, and the Council of Orange, the end product of Augustian theology was quietly but thoroughly abandoned starting in the sixth century. Some of the theolgians who were involved in this abandonment of strict Augustinian theology are known, but the few writings they left are very hard to find. Some seem to have not been translated from Latin.

"Now, given standard philosophical and theological usage of “necessary” and cognate terms, it is clear that Hart is asserting that God creates the world _of necessity_.

"@Uncommon Descent      I don't think you have understood the account of charity given in this post. Charity or love is to will the good of another person. This is the highest call of the Christian and a fulfilment of the entire law. We are called to love God above all things and to love our neighbor as ourselves. It is in this that Christians reflect the image of God who is love itself. It is in this that we show the Spirit of love dwelling within us as ""the love of God is poured into [our] hearts through the Holy Spirit who is given to us"" (Rom 5:5). It is this love that causes us to obey Christ's commands as Jesus taught ""If you love me you will keep my commands"" (John 14:15). The significance of this love for our salvation is that ""Christ is the source of eternal salvation for those who obey Him"" Hebrews 5:9).      This love is even greater than faith (1 Cor 13). Even with faith to move mountains, without love we are nothing (1 Cor 13). It is this love that causes our faith to work as what counts is ""faith working through love"" (Gal 5:6).      Again, this is the entire law: to love God and to love neighbor as oneself. Such love is reflected in the 10 commandments with the first 3 being about loving God and the second 7 being about loving neighbor. It is for this reason that Jesus responded to the rich young ruler's question (""what must I do to be saved?"") by quoting the commandments and then calling him to an act of love for the poor. It is for this reason that Jesus will separate the sheep and the goats based on whether or not they cared for those without clothes, food, and those imprisoned. We will be judged in the end on whether or not love dwells within us. As God is love itself and this love it poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, it is this love by which we ""remain in Christ"" as branches remain in the vine. This occurs when we love even our enemies as Christ calls us to do.      This does not mean that we never correct our enemies or rebuke them. Rebuking a sinner to stop sinning is an act of love. It is a work of mercy. So is instructing those that are ignorant. The key point in the post above is that we should not easily default into thinking that those who disagree with us are malicious. Having that as a default approach is neither reasonable nor charitable and given the centrality of both charity and truth in the Christian life, such an approach is not a Christian approach to discourse.",uncommon descent think understood account charity given post charity love good another person highest call christian fulfilment entire law called love god thing love neighbor christian reflect image god love show spirit love dwelling within u love god poured heart holy spirit given u rom love cause u obey command jesus taught love keep command john significance love salvation christ source eternal salvation obey hebrew love even greater faith cor even faith move mountain without love nothing cor love cause faith work count faith working love gal entire law love god love neighbor oneself love reflected commandment first loving god second loving neighbor reason jesus responded rich young question must saved quoting commandment calling act love poor reason jesus separate sheep goat based whether cared without clothes food imprisoned judged end whether love dwells within u god love love poured heart holy spirit love remain christ branch remain vine occurs love even enemy christ call u mean never correct enemy rebuke rebuking sinner stop sinning act love work mercy instructing ignorant key point post easily default thinking disagree u malicious default approach neither reasonable charitable given centrality charity truth christian life approach christian approach discourse,feser,2453,0,174

Anyway, even if it's true that _some_ creatures ""fall"" in this way, that is the problem of those creatures, and not my problem. The fall is a theodicy that is supposed to show that due to the fact that _some_ fell, we _all_ suffer, including the ""good"" who do not have the sin of pride.

At the end of this investigation, the findings from the historical sources available to this study unfortunately tended to answer this basic question in the positive. This slave trade was not only supported and approved by the Catholic   Church but also received the blessings of the popes for a good number of reasons.""

The soul cannot be free unless the body is. You cannot coherently claim to own a man's labor without claiming to own the man himself.

"The supposition that science amounts to theory plus experiment is, Cartwright observes, widespread among laymen, scientists, and philosophers alike. The mathematically expressible kind of scientific theory, familiar from modern physics and enshrined in equations like _F_ = _ma_ , is taken to be the gold standard. From such equations, it is thought, specific observable consequences are predicted, and the point of experimentation is to test these predictions. And that’s basically it. Except, as Cartwright shows, that isn’t it, not by a long shot. In addition to theory and experimentation, there are models, narratives, diagrams, illustrations, concrete applications, and so on. None of these is reducible to theory or experiment, and neither are they any less essential to the practice and content of science. And when we take account of them, both science and the world it describes are seen to be far more complicated than the common conception of science and its results implies.",supposition science amount theory plus experiment cartwright observes widespread among layman scientist philosopher alike mathematically expressible kind scientific theory familiar modern physic enshrined equation like f taken gold standard equation thought specific observable consequence predicted point experimentation test prediction basically except cartwright show long shot addition theory experimentation model narrative diagram illustration concrete application none reducible theory experiment neither le essential practice content science take account science world describes seen far complicated common conception science result implies,feser,987,0,193

"God's act of creation is God's very essence. That's why creation is a mistery we can not fully grasp. But I think we can show that this doctrine is coherent - or, at least, we can show that the arguments against this doctrine fail.      God has but one act of will - the act by which God wills himself. And God wills everything in the act of willing himself. This Divine Act is the same in every possible world. However, just as a point can be considered as the maximal or the minimum point of different parabolas, or the zero of many different lines, God's Will can be considered as the source of different worlds. His act of Will is really the same, but virtually distinct across possible worlds.      In fact, Saint Thomas says in the Summa contra Gentiles that sometimes a causa has a non-necessary relation with its effects. During the Middle Ages, of course, he was not aware of any probabilistic events - intrinsically probabilistic, I mean, like Quantum Mechanics. But his answer has this deep insight: a cause may produce its effects, not out of necessity, but randomly or because of a free choice.      The argument against Divine Simplicity shifts, at this point, towards intentional directedness. But here I think the argument presupposes an anthropomorphic conception of Divine Choice. We do not know anything about God's psychological life. We can not affirm nor deny the possibility of choosing different things in the same Divine Act.      A final observation: English is not my first language. I hope my text is clear and understandable, despite some mistakes.",god act creation essence creation mistery fully grasp think show doctrine coherent - least show argument doctrine fail god one act - act god will god will everything act willing divine act every possible world however point considered maximal minimum point different parabola zero many different line considered source different world act really virtually distinct across possible world fact saint thomas say summa contra gentile sometimes causa non-necessary relation effect middle age course aware probabilistic event - intrinsically probabilistic mean like quantum mechanic answer deep insight cause may produce effect necessity randomly free choice argument divine simplicity shift point towards intentional directedness think argument presupposes anthropomorphic conception divine choice know anything psychological life affirm deny possibility choosing different thing divine act final observation english first language hope text clear understandable despite mistake,feser,1577,0,201
"Mister Geocon, the problem is that this quote (like many others) is not taken out of context. It comes from the first section of Presbyterorum Ordinis, dealing with priests as ministers of the Eucharist. The section does not mention transubstantiation or the Mass as Christ's propitiatory sacrifice. Instead, in relation to religious buildings: ""...where is worshipped the presence of the Son of God our Saviour, offered for us on the sacrificial altar for the help and consolation of the faithful"". This is where the decree provided a summary of Catholic doctrine on the Mass. Yet essential chunks are avoided. Is this just the Church playing nice guy because it felt like it for the first time in its history when central doctrines are questioned, rather than proclaiming them all the louder, or something else? It's ""something else"" of course.      Of course this is not a denial of Catholic doctrine, but the absence of clarity when clarity was urgent, and measly, world-appeasing word choices like ""presence"", rather than real presence, is grubby. In a time when the real presence and the most important meanings of the Mass are denied or marginalised, to minimise such truths is to feed the sheep to the wolves. Can you see the difference between this and Trent (13th and 22nd sessions)?

"The article is informative and all but I do have some problems with the overall harsh tone of the article especially the ending where in it seems like some of kind of coping mechanism, which more or less translates to ""The going is tough boys, but here is something you can look forward to that will strengthen your faith, the punishment and harsh judgement of those sinners (Followed by Loud Cheers).""      Why can't we just take a more positive route and pray for the conversion and change of those who we don't think are on the right path, why must we depend on looking forward to some fantasized harsh judgement and punishment of those who have lost their way so that our faith is not shaken.      To quote Pope Benedict XVI from God is With Us from the chapter God’s Yes and His Love Are Maintained Even in Death      ""The very heart of the faith has been lost to anyone who supposes that it is only worthwhile, if it is, so to say, made worthwhile by the damnation of others. Such a way of thinking, which finds the punishment of other people necessary, springs from not having inwardly accepted the faith; from loving only oneself and not God the Creator, to whom his creatures belong. That way of thinking would be like the attitude of those people who could not bear the workers who came last being paid a denarius like the rest; like the attitude of people who feel properly rewarded only if others have received less. This would be the attitude of the son who stayed at home, who could not bear the reconciling kindness of his father. It would be a hardening of our hearts, in which it would become clear that we were only looking out for ourselves and not looking for God; in which it would be clear that we did not love our faith, but merely bore it like a burden.""      End quote      To forestall some usual tired objections, obviously this doesn't deny the reality of hell or the reality that some human beings will go to hell or the reality of punishment. These Truths are obvious from Christ's clear words where he says ""Many will not be Able"". (Although on the question of relative numbers and percentages, I am inclined to agree with Cardinal Avery Dulles where he mentioned that God hasn't provided any such stats or figures like more then 50% etc. Those who interpret the narrow path and wide path in that way are free to do so but other interpretations such as taking it to be a practical warning and not as a prediction are legitimate opinions, The pratical warning interpretation is taken by Pope Benedict XVI in ""God and The World "" under the question ""Two Roads"". As in the Book of Revelations, John mentioned he saw an innumerable crowd of people.)         The main point I am trying to make here is that, looking forward to people's punishments isn't healthy and shouldn't be encouraged.

Here's a definition of ""rite"" that would seem to preclude even the possibility of there being such a principle:      _A rite consists of “the diverse liturgical traditions in which the one catholic and apostolic faith has come to be expressed and celebrated in various cultures and lands"" (Catechism Glossary)._",good luck discovery recognizable rite catholic church say recognizable rather obviously said discovered principle distinguishes rite different mass rite eg principle objectively requires consider coptic mass within rite eritrean mass instead allowing considered two distinct mass single rite principle would distinguish without reliance primarily historical accident believe one please feel state source get could find one definition rite would seem preclude even possibility principle rite consists “ the diverse liturgical tradition one catholic apostolic faith come expressed celebrated various culture land catechism glossary,feser,1007,0,213
"The Church was deliberate at Vatican I. It did not extend infallibility further than it did; nor did it make its definition exclusive. That the Pope’s table talk can never have the same weight as his ex cathedra statements is obvious. Ex cathedra statements and General Councils are about letting us know what we must assent to. Traditionally-minded Catholics generally distinguish when this assent is required, and when the Pope is being foolish.      The assertion that Popes can therefore err on faith and morals when not speaking ex cathedra being possible in principle is not Church teaching but a matter of opinion, the likelihood of which could be argued about in terms of probabilities, not certitudes. The mechanical repetition of this opinion makes things simpler for some, but it is not Church teaching.      Ott’s manual had this to say about one historical issue: “On the Honorius question, let it be remarked that Pope Honorius I was personally orthodox. However, through his prohibition against speaking of two modes of operation, he unwittingly favoured the Monothelite error. The Sixth General Council wrongly condemned him as a heretic. Pope Leo II confirmed the anathematisation but did not adopt the ground given by the Council. He did not reproach him with heresy but with negligence in the suppression of error” (Christology. Para. 13). The Church can infallibly indicate what propositions are heretical and where they are textually located. The council condemning Pope Honorius did not indicate where his “heresy” was located. Its mistake on historical fact was not confirmed by the Pope. No council without the Pope is infallible.      What Pope Innocent III affirmed (“Peter’s successors will never at any time deviate from the Catholic faith…) has stood the test of time. The other statement referring to sinning against the faith and being judged for it is not the same thing as leaving the faith, in the sense that Pope Innocent and Vatican I meant by that.      This issue can’t be separated from Vatican I and its affirmation that the Roman See cannot fail in the faith. It’s not a straw man. Obviously, through ex cathedra infallibility, the Church has a guarantee of a rule of faith. But the notion that, apart from this, the Pope could be a kind of Calvin (albeit an invincibly ignorant one) or even a real Calvin, stretches the limits of credibility. We’re back to Balaam’s talking ass.      There haven’t been any heretical Popes in the past (material or formal), and there aren’t any now, strictly speaking – the only manner that counts. That Popes have, in a practical way, and through negligence, weakness and tendentiousness caused massive amounts of damage would amount to Pope Innocent’s idea of sinning against the faith, justifying an angry reaction from the Church. I think that, with the clear movement by some conservatives to leave the Church on the pretext that the papacy has abandoned the faith (this blog has alluded to bishops who are “flirting with schism”), we ought to emphasise how wrong their hypothesis is. Countering it with the notion of a Church, and a promise of Christ, not fundamentally overturned by a potentially heretical Papacy, because it’s only bound to be infallible occasionally, will not convince such people.   I don’t say this is your view of the Church, Dr. Feser, but I think that every time we talk about the limits of papal infallibility we ought to remind people that all Popes have a personal promise that they will not renounce the faith, and that this promise has been honoured.

"(1) That “p and (q or r) = (p and q) or (p and r)” does not hold in the quantum real (is true when we consider non-commutable observable); but it does not hold in our macroscopic world neither also depending what you are observing, e.g. if you are measuring the probability of voting choice a sample of the population will express (just replace p, q and r by some political antagonists names in your part of the world). The logic formula “p and (q or r) = (p and q) or (p and r)” is always valid only in a realm where Boolean logic is always valid, e.g., Newtonian physics. Aristotelian logic is a generalization of that Logic, hence the reality’s structure (included the quantum’s one) it describes has not always abide to that.   (2) As physicist we must not forget that QM as well its subsequent application in particle physics is a “just” a narrative which works (well, at least it is what Copenhagen’s school teaches us). As philosophers, we must give a hermeneutic, or if you prefer, a frame of interpretation for this narrative. Now, philosophically, we do not need a big bunch of new conceptual tools to describe what kind of categories of entities this narrative can be referred to: the Aristotelian one set is more than sufficient, not only at the level of the logic involved but also at the level of the concepts. We are surrounded by realities which are not individualized, not only quarks, electrons and fields of any kind, but also colors, warmth, affection, knowledge. We are also surrounded by beings which need to be “connected” to a bigger whole to exist as such, not only quarks, protons and electrons, atoms and crystals, but also limbs and bodies, leaves and trees, and so on and so forth. As philosophers we must understand that reasoning on a “free” electron is the same as reasoning about a “free” color which would wander by itself, about qualities and accidents: it will follow some rules of the logic and we can even affirm what happens when the yellow color “meets” an orange when this one fruit is ripe. Equations of movement “just” tell us what happens once one of these qualities meets the substance which will allow it to transition (projection in a Hilbert’s space) into something measurable, i.e., something actual, e.g., an “explosion” of any kind of particles (?) or, more precisely analogic and digital electronic signals, in the ATLAS instrumentation at CERN which confirms, or not, the … narrative.

"""That requires an external authority to assign the interpretation to the text.""      Of course, that it is the point of any non-Protestant church (or, if you want, any religion or ideology with exception of the ones derived from Protestantism). In USA, there is an external authority to interpret the Constitution: it is called ""the Supreme Court"".      Texts don't interpret themselves and don't have any meaning before interpretation: they are only ink on a paper or pixels on a screen before humans interpret them. To prevent differences of interpretation, Jesus gave the authoritative interpretation to the apostles: this was the point of Jesus telling his disciples that they had to learn more things but he was going to send the Spirit to teach them.      ""Judaism has a prayer titled ""Elohai Neshamah"" that specifically asserts that you were created pure, unadulterated, and whole as a baby. ""      Rabbinical Judaism is a different religion than Biblical Judaism so recurring to a Rabbinical prayer is not a piece of evidence. Rabbinical Judaism is built as a reaction against Christianity.      Let's look at Biblical Judaism: ""Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me."" (Psalm 51, 5).      This is much earlier than a Rabbinical prayer. Rabbinical Judaism contradicts the Hebrew Bible in many things. In the Talmud, Rabbis are given authority of interpretation even higher than God. When God disagrees on an interpretation, a Rabbi says that God has no authority after he gave the Law at Mount Sinai. Of course, this is completely alien to the spirit of the Hebrew Bible.      ""Literally speaking, the Greek words for ""original sin"" or ""concupiscience"" do not appear anywhere in Romans.""      Yes, the Greek word for Trinity does not appear literally in the entire New Testament. Only that there is a Father, a Son and a Spirit and that the three are God and there is an only God. But ""Trinity""? Not once.      The original sin is not explicit in the Old Testament but saying that it was an invention of Saint Augustine is an exaggeration. Besides hints at Genesis and in the Psalms, we have some sayings of Jesus      ""When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved? Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.” (Matthew 19, 25-26)      There is Romans and there is the fact that man cannot save himself so he needs a Savior.      Yes, Augustine developed the doctrine of original sin and the Church (inspired by the Spirit) adopted it, as an authoritative interpretation. This is similar to other doctrines, such as the Trinity.

"Many today labor under the delusion that the reality of suffering is a difficulty for Christianity – as if Christian doctrine would lead us to expect little or no suffering, so that its adherents should be flummoxed by suffering’s prevalence. As I have discussed in previous articles, this is the reverse of the truth. The Catholic faith teaches that suffering [is the inexorable consequence](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2021/09/the-first- world-problem-of-evil.html) of original sin and past actual sin. [It is an essential part](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2022/05/nietzsche-and-christ- on-suffering.html) of the long and painful process of sanctification, of overcoming sinful habits of thought and action. It is the inevitable concomitant of the persecution Christians must face for preaching the Gospel and condemning the world’s wickedness. It is an inescapable punishment for sin, which we must embrace in a penitential spirit. By way of suffering we pay both our own temporal debt and that of others for whom we might offer up our suffering. By way of it we most closely unite ourselves to Christ’s Passion.

"Finally, Davies emphasizes that “to speak of God as simple is not to attribute a property to God but to deny certain things when it comes to God” (p. 179). Here, as he has in other work, Davies emphasizes the idea that the ascription of attributes to God should be understood as an exercise in _negative_ or _apophatic_ theology. The main arguments for classical theism, he points out, emphasize both that the world is contingent or conditioned in various respects, and that an ultimate explanation of the world must be _un_ conditioned and _non_ -contingent in those respects. (Though, just in case he wouldn’t himself use it, I should note that the language of “conditioned” and “unconditioned” in this context is mine, not Davies’.) In particular, God must _not_ be changeable, must _not_ have properties that are distinct from each other or from him, and so on. This is what it means to characterize him as simple. But by the same token, he must _not_ be compelled to create by anything either internal to his nature or outside of him.

"Walter      This awe and fear of being in God’s presence is not something he inspires, it’s His infinite greatness perceived by a finite creature. It’s the shock of reality unveiled. From behind the veil, at times He spills over such that we can experience a diluted form of His presence where words like gentle, tender, love, peace etc are used. For now we only see dimly, our perception is naturally tuned to dim reality, and so it’s in this diluted form that most of us can distinguish anything other than infinite ‘brightness’.      In general you take a position that conflicts with everything revealed in scripture. So where do you get your information on what God is, what God could do and couldn’t do? If it’s just reason, then what makes you think you can understand the timeless and the infinite? We can’t even think without time. If you ignore revelation, what makes you think humans are able to understand such things any more than ants can understand Special Relativity?      When Jesus Bar Joseph was convicted, Pilate gave the people the option to choose between him and Jesus Barabbas (“son of the father”). Two messianic figures representing two different human perspectives, one human, one divine. Peter originally saw Jesus as the human version, and Jesus responded with “Get thee behind me Satan”.      This is made clearer by the three temptations that Jesus was given in the desert. Satan did not ask for worship, as he is more sly than that. He presented different versions of this human perspective, which relate to suffering, power, and image (being liked or admired). Satan even quotes scripture, the master theologian using scripture to sell the human perspective.      This is what spiritual discernment is all about. You can use Ignatian exercises to help with this, you can go on silent retreat (even into the desert). You can go to weekly mass and a weekly holy hour in silence.

"I feel that we should not treat ""emeritus"" as if it were a term that gets _added into_ the title to become ""pope emeritus"", rather it is a qualifier OF the title. The analogue that justifies putting ""emeritus"" together with the man who was pope is that of a bishop named James who retires in good standing. He doesn't cease to be a bishop, but he does cease to be the bishop ordinary _of that particular see_ of City X. Hence he is not ""Bishop Emeritus James"" simply speaking (he is still a bishop simply speaking), he is _bishop emeritus of X_ and his title would then be ""James, bishop emeritus of X"". So, I suggest that while he was alive, the proper reference would be ""Benedict, pope emeritus"". As there is no other pope emeritus with the name Benedict, he needed no added ""XVI"". If there his successor had taken the name Benedict XVII and then resigned, Ratzinger could be distinguished as ""Benedict XVI, pope emeritus"". Now that he is dead, the proper reference is simply ""Pope Benedict XVI"".

"@ Anonymous:       _Hand waving away consciousness by saying it is caused by evolution is the cause of it, you haven't done anything to address the substance of the philosophical arguments about why consciousness is so weird._      Naturalists say that when brains reach a certain level of ""complexity"", they become conscious (something ""emerges""). And what does that mean? That's just the process of **eduction of the substantial form from the potentialities of prime matter,** described by Aquinas 700+ years ago.      That means that the forms (ADN) are in the potency of prime matter (chemicals) and are then drawn out into act through the agency of the efficient cause (the powers existing in the environment). Once you reach the ""threshold of complexity"", the form appears and so do the new properties and powers, like being self-conscious and being capable of abstract thinking.      So naturalists have reached the same conclusion that St. Thomas did. But St. Thomas had a coherent, hyper-extense, detailed up to the point of exhaustion metaphysical system. They claim ""emergence"" but they can not offer an explanation for it, that's why they hide under the cover of ""Natural Selection"" and her wondrous powers. And that's too why they hide under the cover of ""deep time"" as a last ditch effort to look credible. Naturalists, those ""wondrous powers"" pertain to God and only to God.      So for those who say that our system is ""archaic and obsolete"", I respond that the last laugh is on the hylemorphist. A deep, ample, sustained laugh.

"I would like to gently point out that space and time do not have inherent existence, but rather are epiphenomena or, more accurately, are literary devices within the framework of scientific discourse. Motion is only a displacement ""in space and time"" as a linguistic construct; motion is simply the change in state of any entity. If an entity does not undergo a change in state, nothing occurs and there is no ""flowing time"" for it. Time is only a numbering of different changes in state, just as space is only the enumeration of the extension of a body.   Therefore, when Aristotle states that a mobile does not move as long as its state changes, he is correct. Without a cause, it does not change state and does not move. His physics states something fundamental with respect to the symmetries observed in physics, the first being that of Galileo's group, which states exactly this and that is that the laws of physics at rest or in constant motion (i.e., when the entity does not change state even if the observer is at rest or in motion with respect to it) are the same; not only that, but this is also consistent with the Lorentz group, and that is, if an entity is constantly accelerated in a gravitational field and, therefore does not change state while always remaining equally accelerated, here too the laws of physics do not change for it.

"@ godrigues,      The original question was asked by ficino4ml. His question seemed vague, especially since it referred at the end to ""the status as moral teaching of the counsel"" where what ""the"" counsel means is not specified; in Christian terms ""counsel"" refers usually to the fruit of of the cardinal virtue of prudence, not to the magisterial councils of the Church.      Ficino's question, vague or not, was answered by Tony in a comment of some complexity. I have no argument with what he said. My goal was to deal with IG's response to Ficino's question. Tony referred to IG as a ""moral toddler"" (heh!) and it is his moral toddlership that motivated my comment. So what I aimed at was simplicity. Beyond doubt IG was distorting true Catholic doctrine in order to support a falsehood. If I change my response to him to something vague it essentially gives him a pass.

"So, I would offer as a result something that stems from the way an infallible teaching comes out of the ordinary teachings of the college of bishops: before a specific pronouncement that such a teaching **has become** an infallible teaching, the popes, when they repeat such an infallible teaching, should not be referred to as ""teaching infallibly"". When the pope, in his ordinary exercise of his office as bishop and teacher, repeats the same teaching that bishops (and popes) before him taught, he is _doing the same thing_ they were doing: they were ""teaching"" but doing so as the ordinary exercise of the office of teacher - and that ordinary exercise is not ""teaching in an infallible way"" even if the teaching HAD become infallibly taught already. On the other hand, when such a teaching _has been pronounced_ as ""having been taught by the CHURCH infallibly"" through the ordinary exercise of the bishops in a universal agreement achieved by the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and the pope reiterates that same teaching, we shouldn't say the pope is ""teaching infallibly"" because that doctrine's infallibility _has already been made manifest_ , the pope is merely reasserting what has already been manifested. (We would not normally refer to a later pope who simply repeats the doctrine of Pius IX on the Immaculate Conception as the (later) pope _also_ ""teaching that doctrine infallibly"" - the extraordinary kind of action was taken by Pius IX, and later popes don't have to take on an extraordinary act to mere agree with it, that's an entirely ordinary kind of action.)      Finally: a doctrine that is long taught by the teachers of the Church (especially, the bishops) doesn't become infallible merely from it being taught ""for centuries"" or even ""for many centuries"". While time is _one aspect_ of the way we discern such an infallible doctrine, it is not the core criterion. Rather, it is through _agreement_ by the college of bishops throughout the world. This agreement is difficult (or perhaps impossible) to _identify_ without looking at centuries of common agreement, but arguably ""centuries"" is not by itself _sufficient_ evidence of the universality required. Therefore, it is better to speak (as you did in one place) of popes repeating doctrines that are ""independently known to be infallible"" than of popes repeating doctrines taught ""for centuries"" if you want to capture popes in their ordinary exercise of their magisterial office on teachings that are (separately) infallible.",would offer result something stem way infallible teaching come ordinary teaching college bishop specific pronouncement teaching become infallible teaching pope repeat infallible teaching referred teaching infallibly pope ordinary exercise office bishop teacher repeat teaching bishop pope taught thing teaching ordinary exercise office teacher - ordinary exercise teaching infallible way even teaching become infallibly taught already hand teaching pronounced taught church infallibly ordinary exercise bishop universal agreement achieved guidance holy spirit pope reiterates teaching say pope teaching infallibly infallibility already made manifest pope merely reasserting already manifested would normally refer later pope simply repeat doctrine pius ix immaculate conception later pope also teaching doctrine infallibly - extraordinary kind action taken pius ix later pope take extraordinary act mere agree entirely ordinary kind action finally doctrine long taught teacher church especially bishop become infallible merely taught century even many century time one aspect way discern infallible doctrine core criterion rather agreement college bishop throughout world agreement difficult perhaps impossible identify without looking century common agreement arguably century sufficient evidence universality required therefore better speak one place pope repeating doctrine independently known infallible pope repeating doctrine taught century want capture pope ordinary exercise magisterial office teaching separately infallible,feser,2502,0,280

Scripture so emphasizes the theme that the Incarnation occurred as a remedy for sin that the natural conclusion to draw, in Aquinas’s view, is that there would have been no need for it otherwise.

"Of course Christian doctrine does not lead us to expect little or no suffering, but that is a strong argument against Christian doctrine .   The problem of evil (or suffering) does not say that there should not be so much evil or suffering if _Christian doctrine_ is true, it says that the existence of (so much) evil or suffering is incompatible with a tri-omni God and _hence_ Christian doctrine, along with other doctrines about God, is false. IOW Christian doctrine _cannot_ be true.   It is hardly a secret that ""the Fall"" is one giant theodicy right from the start. But it's a bad theodicy for several reasons, the most important one being that a tri-omni God would not allow for any fall. Without the Fall human beings would have experienced the beatific vision without the need of suffering.      Moreover, this article does not explain why the good are punished and neither does Augustine, it actually comes down to ""nobody is good"" or ""the good are not really punished."".   People who ""shrink from doing their duty to condemn the wickedness that surrounds them"" are not good, so they do not present a case af good people being punished.

"Hi Mister Geocon and Oktavian,      Belief in the Curse of Ham has a long Catholic pedigree. Most of the following quotations are taken from Adiele's book.      Several Church Fathers (e.g. St. Basil of Caesarea, St. John Chrysostom, St. Ambrose, St. Augustine of Hippo) all taught that the human institution of slavery had its origin in Ham's sinfulness. They did not link this to Africa. However, St. Jerome disturbingly refers to ""Ethiopians"" (Kushites) as ""black and cloaked in the filth of sin,"" adding: ""At one time we were Ethiopians in our vices and sins. How so? Because our sins had blackened us.""      Surprisingly, the first text to explicitly link the curse of Ham to Black Africans was the Babylonian Talmud, completed around 600 AD.      In the tenth century, Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria (877-940) was the first Christian Church leader to identify Black Africans as being among those afflicted by the Curse of Ham:      “Cursed be Ham, and may he be servant of his brothers...He himself and his descendants, who are the Egyptians, the Negroes, the Ethiopians, and it is said the   Barbari.”      According to the famous Christian geographical work ""Cursor Mundi"" (1300 A.D.), Noah's son Shem and his descendants were freemen who dwelt in Asia. Japhet and his descendants were nobles and knights who came to live in Europe, while ""Ham, the accursed"" and his descendants were slaves who were sent to Africa.      In the 15th century, the famous Portuguese chronicler Gomes Eannes de Azurara (1410-1474) appealed to the writings of a 12th century archbishop of Toledo, Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada (1170-1247) to support his contention that Black Africans were doomed to servitude because they were the accursed descendants of Ham:      ""The servitude of non-Muslim Moors (West Africans) resulted from the curse, which,   after the Deluge, Noah laid upon his son Ham, cursing him in this way: 'that his race   should be subject to all the other races of the world. And from his race these Blacks are descended,' as wrote the Archbishop Don Roderick of Toledo and Josephus in his Book on the Antiquities of the Jews, and Walter, with other authors who have spoken of the generations of Noah from the time of his going out of the Ark.""      In the 15th century, Dominican Friar Johannes Annius of Viterbo (1432-1502) wrote that the curse of Ham forced him into exile in Africa: “As a result of his sin, Ham is exiled to Africa.”      In the 18th century, French biblical scholar and Benedictine abbot Augustine Calmet (1672-1757) wrote in a work titled “Dictionary of the Holy Bible” (1722): “Noah assigned to Ham the nations of Africa. The occasion of the color of his sons was that Noah being one day asleep discovered his nakedness, and Ham passed that way without covering him; on which accounts his descendants are born with black complexion, and the gift of the prophecy was taken from them.”      In the 19th century, John England, the first Catholic bishop of Charleston, USA, wrote in a letter to US Secretary of State John Forsyth (1780-1841) that the enslavement of Black Africans was entirely lawful, because of the sin committed by their ancestor, Ham:      “Since every Catholic must accept Adam's fall as an essential ingredient in the human condition, he should likewise believe that it certainly was not then against the divine law for Shem and Japheth to use the services of the Black race, since their progenitor had been cursed by God for his sinful conduct.”      Finally, Pope Pius IX issued a Prayer for the Conversion of Africa through the Office of the Sacred Congregation of Rites on October 2, 1873, in which he declared: ""“Let us pray for the most wretched Ethiopians in Central Africa, that Almighty God may at length remove the curse of Cham from their hearts, and grant them the blessing to be found only in Jesus Christ, our God and Lord."" This prayer came with a 300-day indulgence.      Is it ""kind of bonkers"" to say that the Curse of Ham was a major influence on Catholic thought? I think not.",hi mister geocon oktavian belief curse ham long catholic pedigree following quotation taken book several church father eg st basil caesarea st john chrysostom st ambrose st augustine hippo taught human institution slavery origin sinfulness link africa however st jerome disturbingly refers ethiopian kushites black cloaked filth sin adding one time ethiopian vice sin sin blackened u surprisingly first text explicitly link curse ham black african babylonian talmud completed around ad tenth century patriarch eutychius alexandria - first christian church leader identify black african among afflicted curse ham “ cursed ham may servant brothershe descendant egyptian negro ethiopian said barbari ” according famous christian geographical work cursor mundi ad son shem descendant freeman dwelt asia japhet descendant noble knight came live europe ham accursed descendant slave sent africa th century famous portuguese chronicler gomes eannes de azurara - appealed writing th century archbishop toledo rodrigo jiménez de rada - support contention black african doomed servitude accursed descendant ham servitude non-muslim moor west african resulted curse deluge noah laid upon son ham cursing way race subject race world race black descended wrote archbishop roderick toledo josephus book antiquity jew walter author spoken generation noah time going ark th century dominican friar johannes annius viterbo - wrote curse ham forced exile africa “ a result sin ham exiled africa ” th century french biblical scholar benedictine abbot augustine calmet - wrote work titled “ dictionary holy bible ” “ noah assigned ham nation africa occasion color son noah one day asleep discovered nakedness ham passed way without covering account descendant born black complexion gift prophecy taken them ” th century john england first catholic bishop charleston usa wrote letter u secretary state john forsyth - enslavement black african entirely lawful sin committed ancestor ham “ since every catholic must accept fall essential ingredient human condition likewise believe certainly divine law shem japheth use service black race since progenitor cursed god sinful conduct ” finally pope pius ix issued prayer conversion africa office sacred congregation rite october declared “ let u pray wretched ethiopian central africa almighty god may length remove curse cham heart grant blessing found jesus christ god lord prayer came -day indulgence kind bonkers say curse ham major influence catholic thought think,feser,4040,0,297

"@Infinite_Growth, @WCB, @Tony, @grodrigues      Thank you for all commentary over my simple ""if 1=2 then..."" post. My intention was to illustrate metaphorically what seems to me, perhaps innadequatelly, the present practice of public discourse, in that the truthfullness of the premise - antecedent - seldom seems to be unequivocally established, e.g. the measures during the so-called pandemic are a consequence of a premise that does not appear to have been fully True. Rather, the premise was not prone to be falsifiable thus falling outside potential classification as a scientific theory - following Karl Popper. So, in this case the statement ""it is scientifically proven we have a pandemic therefore your freedom need to be culled"" is true becayse the antecedent cannot be proven to be true.

"Dr. Feser,      How do you think Kant's nominalism played into his abandonment of metaphysical proofs for God's existence? Michael Oberst recently wrote an article in History of Phil Quarterly (2015) where he notes that while Kant says little explicitly about universals, his recent interpreters agree that he ""rejected universals."" Oberst agrees with some nuance (trying to situate Kant in some middle ground between nominalism and realism).      Without getting into exegesis of Kant on this point, do you think nominalism might account for his denial of metaphysical proofs? It seems to me that his nominalism would account for this and for his epistemology as well (with nominalism understood as the denial of universal, extra mental form). Any thoughts?

"@Talmid: My condition for the “necessary” is ‘in order to achieve God’s plan’. We can of course only see that very dimly indeed, but it’s clear that the “new heaven and earth” will be more like the creation that people who reject God because of theodicy issues would expect of a good God. No more working in vain, no more pain of witnessing your children's misfortune. The wolf and the lamb eat together, even the lion no longer eats other creatures. So it seems clear to me from revelation that these things are a necessary phase of creation. When God creates he says it’s “good”, even though He knew it would contain elements that would not be part of the second creation. Once we were consciously able to choose between Him and not-Him, we often chose the latter. However it’s in making this choice correctly when it’s not obvious or easy that we ‘grow up’, as in we become as our Father intended.      Now I agree with you that we can imagine universes where we would be free and where we could easily see what is right, where there is no suffering of us or others to make us ‘loose heart’, and where there are no bright and shiny false lights with temporary excitement and pleasure. However, like the vines planted in good, loamy soil, which produce great big bunches of grapes but poor wine, there is clearly a need for us to struggle a bit in an apparently sub optimal environment for the creation process to have a successful end point. How God knows that, we cannot know. Did He tune creation like a quantum experiment, with all possible realities happening, and from eternity selected the one that worked best? Or did He just know, because He is infinite and absolute in all things? I suspect the latter, but the point is that we see a very small part of the creation process.

"@ Laudator Temporis Acti,      ""Why did you think I said 'under classic conditions'?""      I have no idea what you mean by ""classic conditions"". The geometry of the surface of a sphere goes back to the Greek mathematitions of classic Greece in the 5th century BC.      ""However, the differing accounts of infallibility do PROVE that humans can be wrong about infallibility.""      You are hiding behind a funny obsession about infallibility. The joke is that it amounts to a useless and ridiculous infinite regress. I.e. ""You are not infallible about that"" ... ""Yes, but you are not infallible about _that_"" ... ""Sure, but you are absolutely not infallible about_THAT_, etc, etc, etc ad infinitum.      Humans are going to talk about things anyway. If you are going to try to block these things by saying ""not infallible"", why not say nothing because you are not infallible either.      Sheesh!      :-)      ""But can he create a physical universe containing 127 and 128 in which the former is not prime and the latter is not a power of 2?""      Yes.      Every created thing is an image of God even though the created thing may not seem like God at all. We say that the image exists pre-eminently in God. So if one says a house is like the architect who designed it, we say that the house exists pre-eminently as an image in the mind of the architect, and he creates his observable plan drawings from the unobservable image in his mind and the house is built from these drawings by his agent, the carpenter. So the house is an image of the architect. This is straight out of Aquinas.      In the same way, I can specify a model, or image, of God. The model exists pre-eminently in God and is like Him, even though it is just me who specifies the model. God is not limited by the limitations of the model, but what can be shown in the model exists pre-eminently in God.      The model, or likeness, is an infinite unbiased binary sequence of 50/50 bits. All finite subsequences exist within this infinite sequence. If the consecutive binary digits are each 50/50, then the infinite sequence is a normal sequence. Even so, any subsequence of specified finite length could be missing a particular sub-sub-sequence of itself because such a subsequence itself must appear normally within the infinite sequence. Therefore, discovery by bitwise examination of a subsequence of finite length, no matter how long, that misses a particular sub-sub-sequence cannot be a demonstration that the infinite sequence is not normal.      A description of finite space and time is encoded by a finite subsequence of the infinite normal sequence. A computer that can run the subsequence as a program, including memory, could virtually reproduce all that we experience of reality, given the finite resolution of our senses in time and space. We would not be able to tell whether a missing sub-sub-sequence would exist further along in time in which the rules of arithmetic are no longer what they were. Since the infinite sequence is of random bits, the rules of arithmetic really are not rules. They have just appeared to be rules by random chance. The model, as explained, does not specify God or God's will. So we cannot say from the model whether God could change what appeared to be rules of arithmetic into completely different rules where 128 is not a power of 2 and 127 is a composite number.

"As a Protestant, I'll try to defend the language here. One of the reasons, surely, for not wanting *all* criticism to be public is not to scandalize the faithful, or keep them in an incessant boil of controversy and doubt. Since you're willing to be idealistic, let us suppose that prestige in the relevant sense might have best accrued to those who have the greatest reputation for caring about and knowing the truth. And it is those, perhaps, who are most likely to make the point in a way that gets the attention of the right people and does not scandalize the church or give a sense that people are easily or freely doubting the pope / church.

"Walter,      ""No, it not intrinsic properties change *after* we have chosen, they happen when we are choosing. A choice to do X differs from a choice to do ~X.   If you can either go the the right or to the left, then if you choose (or 'decide') to go to the left, your mind has the 'content' ""go to the left"".""      The choice to do X is different from the choice to do ~X because the effects are different, but if Libertarian Freedom is to work, the two effects could indeterministically come about from the same cause without any difference of intrinsic properties in it. If there was a difference which was associated only with X (and another with ~X) then that would entail that the agent would have already chosen either X or ~X, since he would have the corresponding property for one or the other. And if he has already chosen, he is no longer choosing.      Again: you at t in state S can cause either X or ~X. Do you not see how this is required for LFW?   If in order to cause X you had to be in S1 and to cause ~X you had to be in S2, then if you were in S1 you would not be able to cause ~X, and hence would not be able to choose between X and ~X. The same state of the agent must be able to cause either X or ~X; the same state of the agent must be able to produce a branching (one world in which you at t in S caused X, and another world in which you at t in S caused ~X).      ""What actually causes this content is another matter, it only matters for our discussion that there is...""      It absolutely matters for our discussion! If we can only choose X if we have an ""intention"" Y which is incompatible with our choosing ~X, then in order to be libertarian-free when choosing X I need to have caused Y with libertarian freedom.

"Regarding your suggestion that it is up to me why I should hold a position that is contrary to the state of our society and that this is ""up to me"": Well this is true, but profoundly unhelpful for our discussion. It is ""up to you"" whether you believe in fairies and goblins. You are ""free"" to believe in fairies and goblins, but that does not make such a belief rooted in Scripture or Tradition. Nor does it make it reasonable. And choices that are rooted neither in reason nor revelation are baseless. Such ""freedom"" is really no freedom at all. It is a sheer willfulness to believe whatever I want to believe regardless of reason, evidence, and revelation. That is the point. Authentic freedom is always rooted in reason and/or revelation. In other words, authentic freedom is always rooted in the truth. If I have neither reason nor revelation to support my belief in fairies, then it is unreasonable to do so. If you wish to believe in fairies because they give you warm fuzzy feelings, you are ""free"" to do so, but that does not make your choice a good choice. It makes it baseless just as your choice to believe that everyone may be going to heaven is baseless.      This leads to the biggest problem with the position: counterfactuals. As Edward Feser has noted, it is part of the Tradition that rational beings are in hell, namely Satan and His Angels. It is also clear from Scripture that the way is narrow and few will find it. Now some passages of Scripture are difficult to interpret and admit varying interpretations. However, if one's ""interpretation"" involves denying or ignoring the testimony of Scripture, then this is not really an interpreation so much as a denial of the explicit teaching of Sripture. So if Scripture teaches that the way to eternal life is narrow and few will find it and I say it is broad and everyone will (or might find), then I am denying revelation. Who will or will not be saved is not something you or I could know apart from revelation. However, it is something that God knows and He has revealed to us that ""few will find it"".

"Apologies, that was written in a pre christmas rush. My point was more that the nature of the Roman empire was such that when Christianity started to grow in towns and cities (within living memory of the events), if soldiers/officials etc based in Jerusalem at the time denied that a preacher called Jesus had been crucified at all, that would surely have been used as an argument against the Christians early on. However we have details of the criticisms against the early believers, and none of them were that Jesus had not existed, or that he had not been crucified etc.      So yes any local records were likely destroyed AD 70, but my contention is still that when you look at the development of civilisation up until then, although there were others that kept some level of written administration (such as the Egyptians, Assyrians, Greeks etc), the Romans were distinct in the likes of administration, language, education and commentary - across a vast portion of the known world - in a way that seems fitting to me for the incarnation, for the ‘covenant with all peoples’.

"@Laudator Temporis Acti      There is nothing about your objection that logically limits its application to matters of religion - if it were valid, it would remove the possibility of objective certainty in any field of knowledge, since any assertion we made would always require the implicit qualification, 'But since I am fallible, I could be wrong about this' (even about e.g. 2+2=4).      I'll mention in passing - the objection, thus taken to its logical conclusion, would therefore appear to be self-refuting, because the objector puts forward the objection itself as objectively certain truth (not qualifying it as 'merely probable').      But be that as it may, I will try to show that (whether or not its conclusion is self-refuting) the objection is a logical fallacy.      This is its basic structure:      It is possible for beliefs of mine to be false.   X is a belief of mine.   Therefore it is possible that X is false.      Consider the parallel argument:      It is possible for cats to be black.   Fluffy is a cat.   Therefore it is possible that Fluffy is black [even though I can see she is white].      The reason that these arguments fail is that I can be aware of more about Fluffy than the fact that she is a cat, and I can be aware of more about 'X' than the fact that it is a belief of mine. If all we knew about Fluffy was that she was a cat, then it would be reasonable to say that it was possible that she was black. And if all we knew about X was that it was a belief of my fallible self, then it would be reasonable to say that X was possibly false.      But in fact, I can know from the evidence of my senses that in Fluffy's case, the abstract possibility for cats to be black is not fulfilled in her particular case. And I can know from direct knowledge of conclusive logical or factual evidence in the particular case of X (e.g. 2+2=4), that the abstract general possibility of my beliefs being false is not fulfilled in the particular case of my belief X.      This is why the general fallibility that is ours as humans does not prove the impossibility of individuals reaching valid objective certainty in particular cases, where the individual is aware of sufficient evidence for the belief.

"One should never murder anyone. Killing, on the other hand, can sometimes be justified.      One question about killing the leader of an invading country is whether the leader counts as a civilian, since the killing of civilians is forbidden by the Geneva Convention. There is also some worry about the Geneva Convention's killing by ""perfidy"", which is taken to rule out at least some assassinations. So, as a matter of positive international law, it seems a difficult question.      Were there no international law on the matter, I wouldn't see a significant difference between killing a political leader and killing a general, if both are giving orders to fight. Morally speaking, but not necessarily in international law, both seem to me to be equally combatants.      Besides the moral and legal questions, there is also a prudential question. In my post I assumed that killing the general would stop the invasion. I got to assume that because I was making up the case. Whether in actual fact killing a leader would stop an invasion is less clear.

"In addition, putting off confession that long on purpose (not because of anything out of your control) would smack of impiety. Why would a Christian want to take such a risk, and to coldly shun God's great offer of mercy? Most of the reasons for doing so are bad ones (IE, ""I want to continue sinning in the short term, but don't want to go to Hell, so I'll repent only at the last minute"".) Not everyone who puts off Confession does so for such a bad reason, but it still seems at least mildly scandalous, and while God certainly does accept last-second conversions and repentances, it's hardly a goodly and Christian attitude to deliberately seek to repent at the last second instead of earlier. Dante may not be Scripture, but he places those who repent only at the last minute in Ante-Purgatory, where they must wait for a time equal to their mortal lives before they can begin being cleansed in Purgatory.",addition putting confession long purpose anything control would smack impiety would christian want take risk coldly shun great offer mercy reason bad one ie want continue sinning short term want go hell repent last minute everyone put confession bad reason still seems least mildly scandalous god certainly accept last-second conversion repentance hardly goodly christian attitude deliberately seek repent last second instead earlier dante may scripture place repent last minute ante-purgatory must wait time equal mortal life begin cleansed purgatory,feser,910,0,377

"@ Miguel Cervantes,      'The ”scholars” you mention fail to establish their theory and the proofs you’ve mentioned don’t fit the bill'      You've summarized it nicely. Miguel. As far as scholars go, I hesitate to write the word unless with quotes - ""scholars"" - but who is to define what a scholar is? There are many schools of thought in contention, but as Aquinas might have put it, truth doesn't contend with truth. So what does that say of scholarship? Out of respect for Ed, I leave the quotes off when I write ""scholar"" (heh), because he does not contend with truth as we have been guided to know it, nor do many others who act as scholars, even though in minor matters they might disagree in minor ways. As Gregory put it, as reported by Aquinas, ""homo sentit cum pecoribus, et intelligit cum angelis"" (Summa Theologiae 1a, q54, A5, Sed Contra). Unfortunately, not even the angels are all good. Much less can it be said for man. Many men (and women) follow the brutes in their thinking.      But we can usefully pray for them as we cannot for bad angels.

"Aquinas does not elaborate, but it seems to me that what he is driving at is the need for what is traditionally referred to as the _praeparatio evangelica_ or “preparation for the Gospel.” The Incarnation could not properly be understood just at any old time or location. Rather, the right cultural preconditions had to be in place. Consider that, as St. Paul famously noted, the notion of God incarnate dying on the cross was a stumbling block for the Jews, and seemed foolishness to the Greeks (1 Corinthians 1:23). To be sure, it is _not_ in fact foolishness and should not have been a stumbling block.

"""Decrying the fact that Whites are beginning to no longer be the majority in America""      I honestly haven't seen any serious conservative thinker (And I don't include the reactionary commentary of people like those at the daily wire) who has ever decried that white people are no longer going to be the majority in America.      Most sane conservative commentators decry both the excesses of the far right and the far left.      To quote a piece from one of the best natural law theorists alive on the planet today Prof J Budziszewski      ""Progressives like to say that a racist doctrine they call “replacement theory” is very big on the right.      I won’t say there is no such theory. There is. Actually, though, versions of the theory are held both on the farthest, farthest fringes of the right and – more quietly – among large, large sections of the left.      The right wing version is that immigrants, especially immigrants of color, outbreed people who were born in the country, so that descendants of the former will “replace” descendants of the latter. This is supposed to be bad.      The left wing version is that immigrants, especially immigrants of color, trend more to the left than people who were born in the country, so that leftists will “replace” conservatives. This is supposed to be good.      Both versions of the theory are nuts.      As to the former version: If the country becomes browner in a few generations, so be it. People who are too selfish to have children deserve to be “replaced” by people who love them.      As to the latter version: Immigrants who are acquainted with the politics of the country are often quite conservative; they don’t want to lose what they’ve worked and suffered to attain. So if left-wingers think immigration will lead to the “replacement” of conservatives by liberals, they may have it backwards.""      End quote      As you can see most sane right wingers don't really care if whites are a majority or not.

Or are you implying it's a non-falsifiable theory? I think it would be difficult to prove either of those. ""Natural selection"" is based on empirical evidence. Even if you don't believe the empirical evidence supports the theory, surely you must see that this is the claim. So the best way to contradict the theory is to show empirical evidence that it's false. One could demonstrate a different mechanism that achieves the same result -- that would do it. I don't see how pure logic will reveal a contradiction.      Brains are not 100% reliable. It does not follow that they are 100% unreliable. The brain enhances an organism's chances for survival in the real world, not in a world of imagination. Truth is not totally isolated from survival. So I disagree with Churchland's implication that a search for truth is an unintended consequence, of sorts. There are many truths a brain in survival mode will count as irrelevant.

"@jmchugh:      ""There is no way that you could argue that the actual existence of Satan is a positive good.""      I would argue that the existence of Satan, qua *being* is a positive good, because being is good -- this is Thomism 101. God did not create Satan as Satan; Asking why permit or allow Satan qua Satan, is asking the wrong question. Satan does not exist alone in a vacuum but as an element within the created order. The created order is good (not even Satan wants to destroy it to the point of non-existence which is what you are arguing entails, rather he wants to pervert it to his *own* perverted ends); could there be some created order that is better in some aspect or other, say, without Satan as Satan?

"@WCB(continutation)      Nevertheless, ugliness does exist, so how are we to account for it? Although there are other forms of ugliness, it is moral ugliness that tends to cause people to have objections against God’s existence. It is for this reason that such arguments are typically structured in the form of the problem of evil. However, they can also be structured in relation to beauty and ugliness as moral acts are well ordered acts (and thus beautiful) and immoral acts are disordered and thus ugly.      We recognize that there is something ugly about cruelty. We recognize that there is something very ugly and unattractive about racism. We recognize that this is not fitting because race neither increases nor decreases the worth of a person. Likewise, it is morally ugly to be ungrateful to those who have given to your sacrificially for your good. Gratefulness would be a more fitting or proportionate (or we might say appropriate) response. There is something repulsive about people who are racists, cruel, or ungrateful. Conversely there is a moral beauty to people who are grateful, kind, and who treat others justly. Their actions are beautiful because their actions are fitting or proportionate.      This recognition of beauty and ugliness in moral acts is reflected in our language. It is for this reason that parents say to their children, “Don’t be ugly” when those children are being unkind to their siblings. It is also for this reason that Mother Theresa’ exhorted others to live a sacrificial life in service of God in terms of “Doing something beautiful for God.”      As a final example of ugliness, it is ugly for someone to be habitually skeptical of those who merit their trust. The problem with habitual skeptics is that they are not able to recognize either good will or good arguments. This is a moral defect that is ugly and damages the relationships the skeptic has with other people whom he or she should trust and damages the skeptics ability to discern truth. The alternative to such a disposition is not naïve credulity. The alternative is an openness to good arguments and a good faith effort to understand such arguments. This allows us to recognize truth as we earnestly seek it and to recognize people of good will and sound mind who can teach us the truth. Such a disposition allows people to learn from St. Thomas Aquinas and if they have goodwill to begin to see that his arguments are extremely strong if they are only given a real hearing (the life of Dr. Feser attests to this).      So moral ugliness exists and it consists of a disordered disposition and disordered acts. Is there reason for us to think that this impugns the Beauty of God? Here the basic distinction between necessity and contingency is extremely important. God is necessarily good as He is Goodness Itself. He is also necessarily Beautiful as He is Beauty Itself. We are beautiful by nature but are not necessarily beautiful. That is to say that moral ugliness is a possibility for us precisely because we are created. If we had a will that was coterminous with beauty, we would be the creator and not the creature (making the creation of a necessarily beautiful person as contradictory as a square circle and thus not impugning God’s power). By nature of being a creature, our will can be set on beauty (morally well ordered acts), but it is not set there with necessity. Our beauty is contingent based on the contingency of our moral acts.

" _The assent due to the Pope's teaching differs here, because his teaching is different, not the other way round. Do you seriously argue this principle everywhere (that authorities and their modes of teaching differ primarily because of the assent they induce)?_      I go by what the Church says. The Church teaches that we owe deference to the pope's teaching, including to his non-infallible teaching. She also teaches that we owe deference to the _teaching of the Church_ , including that of the bishops. In both kinds she refers to that kind of deference that falls under the term ""religious assent."" There are, under religious assent, different degrees of deference called for. If the non-infallible teaching of the pope is a different _kind of thing_ than the teaching of the bishops, I have not heard a name for it. If the kind of assent given to the pope's teaching is a different kind of assent than what is given to the teaching of the bishops, I have not heard a name for it. Please do tell.      _John XXII did not teach heresy,_      I did not say it was. As you well know. Not all error is heresy.      _and only (in two sermons) propounded, as opinions,_      I have read that he ""taught"" it, not that he ""proposed it as an opinion"". I would be glad to have his _actual words_ in those two sermons to see the truth, if you have a basis on which to say that he ""proposed it as opinion"". In general terms, I would suggest that a bishop ""teaches"" in sermons except he makes explicit reference to an idea being less certain and offer that it _may_ be not given credit as true. A pope would need to be even more careful than other bishops to successfully ""not teach"" in a sermon.      _each of us is directly subject to the Pope's jurisdiction_      But of course.      _The Pope is no ""president""_      Well, he can in fact preside, but that does not describe his office nor are his powers limited to presiding. Of course.      _Not only is all episcopal jurisdiction a participation in Papal jurisdiction;_      Not only does Pastor Aeternus NOT say this, it implies the opposite:      _5\. This power of the Supreme Pontiff by no means detracts from that ordinary and immediate power of episcopal jurisdiction, by which bishops, who have succeeded to the place of the apostles by appointment of the Holy Spirit, tend and govern individually the particular flocks which have been assigned to them. On the contrary, this power of theirs is asserted, supported and defended by the Supreme and Universal Pastor; for St. Gregory the Great says: ""My honor is the honor of the whole Church. My honor is the steadfast strength of my brethren. Then do I receive true honor, when it is denied to none of those to whom honor is due.""_      Nowhere does this even _hint_ that the powers (and jurisdiction) of each bishop derive from that of the pope, the implication seems (to me) clear that this is NOT the case, and that the bishops' offices and powers are indeed those of the Apostles, ""by the appointment of the Holy Spirit.""",assent due teaching differs teaching different way round seriously argue principle everywhere authority mode teaching differ primarily assent induce go church say church teach owe deference teaching including non-infallible teaching also teach owe deference teaching church including bishop kind refers kind deference fall term religious assent religious assent different degree deference called non-infallible teaching pope different kind thing teaching bishop heard name kind assent given teaching different kind assent given teaching bishop heard name please tell john xxii teach heresy say well know error heresy two sermon propounded opinion read taught proposed opinion would glad actual word two sermon see truth basis say proposed opinion general term would suggest bishop teach sermon except make explicit reference idea le certain offer may given credit true pope would need even careful bishop successfully teach sermon u directly subject jurisdiction course pope president well fact preside describe office power limited presiding course episcopal jurisdiction participation papal jurisdiction pastor aeternus say implies opposite \ power supreme pontiff mean detracts ordinary immediate power episcopal jurisdiction bishop succeeded place apostle appointment holy spirit tend govern individually particular flock assigned contrary power asserted supported defended supreme universal pastor st gregory great say honor honor whole church honor steadfast strength brother receive true honor denied none honor due nowhere even hint power jurisdiction bishop derive pope implication seems clear case office power indeed apostle appointment holy spirit,feser,3031,0,424

First, negatively, we have no good reason to think that all will be saved.

From this weight of this tradition, we find nothing like VB's mere wish given the misnomer ""hope"" (which is a theological virtue). Where then did VB get his inspiration for this position: again, as I noted above, it was influenced by Barth who had little role for cooperation with grace in his thought. From his foregone position, VB misrepresented the weight of tradition in the reading of the Church Fathers. He did not find something that no other theologian had seen that was actually present in the tradition. He creatively misrepresented the tradition to bend his ""research"" in the direction of foregone conclusions.

"Talmid      I do not necessarily reject the idea that being and goodness are the same, but if that's so, being should be good and not be bad in any way.

"Someone explain ""measure"" to me in Aquinas. Like I'm five. Well maybe 25. This section of De Veritate for example:      Note, however, that a thing is referred differently to the practical intellect than it is to the speculative intellect. Since the practical intellect causes things, it is a measure of what it causes. But, since the speculative intellect is receptive in regard to things, it is, in a certain sense, moved by things and consequently measured by them. It is clear, therefore, that, as is said in the Metaphysics, natural things from which our intellect gets its scientific knowledge measure our intellect. Yet these things are themselves measured by the divine intellect, in which are all created things—just as all works of art find their origin in the intellect of an artist. The divine intellect, therefore, measures and is not measured; a natural thing both measures and is measured; but our intellect is measured, and measures only artifacts, not natural things.      Is a measure, measures, is measured...what is happening? I think ""measure"" and I picture someone with a ruler walking up to a sofa or whatever and thinking: I wonder if that will fit in my living room. Hm. I will measure it and then we will see. That's it. But Aquinas is taking some basic meaning of this word and extending it to a host of other things, and I can't quite grasp what that is.

"For another thing, the Incarnation positively aids us in pursuing what is good, in several ways. By speaking to us directly, as a human being himself, God makes the truths of revelation better known to us, thereby fostering the theological virtue of faith. By taking on our nature he also shows the depth of his love for us, thereby fostering the virtue of hope. Insofar as this prompts us to love God in return, it also fosters in us the virtue of charity. By living a perfect life, Christ sets an example of how we ought to live. By uniting divinity and humanity in himself, he reveals something of the supernatural end of the beatific vision, which also involves such a union (albeit not in exactly the same way).",another thing incarnation positively aid u pursuing good several way speaking u directly human god make truth revelation better known u thereby fostering theological virtue faith taking nature also show depth love u thereby fostering virtue hope insofar prompt u love god return also foster u virtue charity living perfect life christ set example ought live uniting divinity humanity reveals something supernatural end beatific vision also involves union albeit exactly way,feser,716,0,435
"Erick, Vatican I explains how those Councils condemning Pope Honorius for his failings must be interpreted. For the First Vatican Council cites the Fourth of Constantinople: ""For in the apostolic see the catholic religion has always been preserved unblemished"", which is hardly consistent with a heretical Pope not long prior to it. The Vatican Council defines: ""This gift of truth and never-failing faith was therefore divinely conferred on Peter and his successors in this see..."". The quality of never-failing faith (not exactly the same thing as speaking ex cathedra) has to be understood as pertaining to all Popes, including Honorius. The task of theologians is to interpret the case of Honorius with this understanding in mind, I would suggest, rather than have too many hangups about inflammatory language by oriental bishops that confounded (as we understand it today) formal heresy with aiding and abetting.      I think Fr. Amman's argument above does that well.

"Hi everyone,      Thanks you all for your responses.      Talmid, you write: ""Either it [Pure Existence] is infinite or it is finite. But if PE was finite them it would be a certain form of existence and so not PE, which is contradictory, so PE has to be infinite.""      What your argument really proves is that the notion of ""pure existence"" is utterly amorphous: it is not tied to any particular form. But by the same token, since it has no form, we cannot say that it is positively infinite, either; all we can say is that it has no positive characteristics at all.      RunDec, you object to my assertion that the alleged distinction between a thing's essence and its existence can be explained in terms of the form-matter distinction, by arguing as follows: ""the existence of an animal might require its material exemplification, but this is not the case with immaterial beings (such as souls, angels, God, or any other candidates).""      Re separated souls: at least we can say that they once had bodies and that they will one day have them back, so we can regard them as being ""branded,"" so to speak, by the matter they informed. Re angels: I'm sure you're well aware that there were many medieval philosophers who held that angels are not pure forms, but possess a kind of spiritual matter, allowing two or more angels to be of the same species. As for God, His essence and existence are commonly held to be identical, anyway.      You also ask, ""if God had an accident distinct from himself (his essence), where would this accident come from? It can't come from the essence lest you accept the precedence of a perfectly simple Essence which is the source of all things, which is what you're trying to avoid.""      I'm quite happy to say that God's essence is simple. What I insist is that God's Mind or Essence has multiple thoughts and intentions which are contingent accidents - e.g. God's concept of this universe, and His intention to make it.      You deny that having an intention is a necessary condition for making a choice because ""if it were, we would never be able to choose anything, since we would have to choose our intention before being able to make a choice, and that is circular or regressive."" However, your argument misconstrues my position, which is that an agent's choice to do something must be (at least logically, even if not temporally) preceded by a plan or intention to do it. Otherwise, it would be impossible to attribute an action A to spiritual agent X rather than spiritual agent Y, as neither of them would have done anything to identify it as the cause of A. But although I produce things (or states of affairs) as an agent, I do not ""produce"" my intentions; I just have them. They are voluntary, but not in the same sense that my actions are. My intentions have no prior cause; I just have them, and that's all. So too with God.      I don't have any problem with an agent either choosing to bring about X or choosing not to bring about X, and having an identical causal history in both cases. What bothers me is the notion of an agent acting without a plan. That just makes no sense. Cheers.      William,      While Ed doesn't deny that God is personal, He construes God's personhood in terms of His possessing an intellect (and will), which in turn is construed in terms of God being Pure Act and containing (eminently) every form which He generates, within Himself, since He is Pure Being. Thus God's personhood is grounded in impersonal notions like ""being"" and ""act"": for Thomists, these are what God is, primarily. I maintain that God has thoughts of His own, which are in some sort of Divine language, and these thoughts are what makes God personal.      I hope Ed spoils himself this Christmas and buys himself a copy of Professor Francesca Stavrakopoulou's ""God: An Anatomy."" It will change the way he thinks about the God of the Bible. Cheers.

"""Rather, creation is a matter of making it the case that there is any world at all.""      Beyond the focus of Thomistic proofs on God as the cause of the existence of the world, it seems to me that even more can be done with proofs that were not thought possible at the time of Aristotle or St. Thomas. This would require somewhat of a partnership between Thomism and the work of scientists of an ID bent.      Aristotle thought that there was no possible philosophical demonstration that the world was created in time and not eternal. St. Thomas agreed. This pertains to species or kinds in that they imagined the philosophical possibility that the forms of various animal kinds have been generating offspring eternally. Inferences from the fossil record however show that this is not the case. So we have to account for the origins of these various kinds or species.      Now the suggestion that such a question has always been approached in a metaphysically neutral way is naive. We have to have some idea of what a species is before we even approach this question. On this point, the classical and medieval realist account of a species is radically different from the Darwinian account which was influenced by a nominalist metaphysics. The darwinian account looks for minute differences to distinginguish species and so you have various small mouth bass ""species"" in such a view based on some amount of (now) genetic variation. The problem with this approach is that the amount of genetic variation to determine a distinct species is completely ad hoc and the nominalist idea that things are ultimately radically particular actually eliminates species all together.

"@anonymous.      What does or does not ""seem heretical"" to you is not the criteria by which something is or is not heretical. The position you are describing is a position that has been condemned by the Church. Pope Pius IX condemened the following proposition in the the Syllabus of Errors: ""Good hope at least is to be entertained of the eternal salvation of all those who are not at all in the true Church of Christ"" (17). This condemnation draws from a previous encyclical entitled Quanto Conficiamur.      So the suggestion that there is good reason to hope for the salvation of all men has been condemned by the Church. Balthasar was aware of this and would not have gone so far as to say that we have good reason to hope for the salvation of everyone. To make this assertion is again to affirm what the Church has condemned.      Where does this leave the position of Balthasar? It leaves him with a hope that is based neither in reason nor in revelation. It leaves him with an irrational hope. That is the problem with the position: it is rooted neither in reason nor revelation.      In the Tradition, the overwhelming weight of the Church Fathers is against the positions of Gregory of Nyssa and Origen and a couple of clever theologians do not overturn the weight of a broad range of Church Fathers that includes a great number of doctors of the Church.      It certainly doesn't overturn the words of Christ that ""the way is narrow and *few will find it*"" (Mt. 7:14). These words are not taken seriously by those in the Balthasar camp. Balthasar's position on this issue was influenced by the reformed theologian Karl Barth. Such theologians have an account of election that has little place for human freedom and secondary causality. They read salvation as though God will save us without us. This is not the Catholic position. The Catholic position is that we need to cooperate with God's grace to be saved.      So, the Balthasarian position in order to remain orthodox on this point would have to posit that we should hope that everyone in history has, is, and will cooperate with God's grace. Well, we might ask the disciples of Balthasar, what reason do we have for thinking that everyone in the world has, is, and will cooperate with God's grace? Oh, you don't have a good reason to think that? Well why in the world would I hold a position that has no rational basis and is widely rejected by the Church Fathers? Why would I hold a position that is so manifestly contrary to the state of our corrupt society?

" _The ""form"" is not an illusion in the sense that it doesn't exist at all, it is an illusion because it doesn't exist as a somehow semi-independent quality._      The problem is that this really doesn't solve the problem; other than a chair, the problems of reducing the function of sensory organs to mere arrangements is more apparent. But that should be there minor quibble here. (It should be said though that the chair in itself has ascribed properties it mere parts lack, e.g. its shape, which makes the mereological nihilism you're hinting at quite implausible. Ever the more so for a biological organ)      More importantly, the goal should be to undermine skepticism. And this is actually only possible if we suppose that a function is fulfilled here. An eyeball displaying illusions is only wrong (wrong as the normative judgment that it's not doing its job) insofar as there is an objectively correct mode of observation that the eyeball in question is incapable to represent. That is only something a form with a corresponding final cause is able to sustain. In either the atomist or the monist worldview, this idea has no room, since the arrangement is always only shape-wise, an imitation instead of a real member. If we take the two options seriously we have no reason to assume the observed data we're witnessing is actually reality representing.      Of course we can't guarantee that with the Aristotelian conception either, after all they could malfunction right now. But the point is, similar to the debate about causation of contingent events, which worldview actually allows us rationally to employ phenomenal conservatism, and that's just what Koons describes here.

"You want full message, fine here.   -I read your ""The experience of God"" book twice and I have some questions regarding it.   First is a minor nitpick (And I mean no offence for saying this) but I feel you have a tendency to use too many $10 words. Case in point; you use the word ""quotidian"" at least 5 times that I can remember, when that word is almost never better than its friendly companions ""daily"", ""everyday"", ""ordinary"", and ""commonplace"". Now having a large vocabulary isn't a bad thing, but a flagrant use of obscure words made it very difficult to understand your point.   My second problem is your concept of God and how you define it. Your definition of God is that in trying to elevate Him to the loftiest heights, heights truly befitting the magnificence of God, I feel you have reduced Him to empty concepts/platitudes, both completely meaningless and as uninspiring as mathematical axioms. What could it mean to say God is existence, or consciousness, or bliss, or any of the other abstract concepts that one often hears thrown about by other religious believers: love, truth, the alpha and the omega, and so on? One might as well argue that God is electricity, gravity, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Of course, this would be ludicrous. Who would seek ecstatic union with the weak nuclear force, or pray to electricity, or find solace in the presence of gravity? But slap a poetic, inspirational-sounding abstraction on God (being, truth, beauty, etc.), and suddenly the whole thing gains a veneer of credibility it hasn't earned.   The meaninglessness of your idea of God culminates in your assertion that God must be simple, unable to “possess distinct parts, or even distinct properties” (p.128), and, as eternal, He can’t be subject to change either (time being a measure of change – not to mention the fact that change indicates a movement from potentiality to actuality, whereas God is pure actuality (another meaningless concept)). What can possibly be left over after one has removed distinct parts/properties and the ability to change?   Lastly you defend all of this by claiming that any other way of thinking about God is guilty of anthropomorphism; the tendency to re-make God in our own image and likeness. The charge of anthropomorphism is undeniably valid when people try to convince us that a being even the tiniest bit like what you describe, God cares about what you do in the privacy of your own bedroom, or desires human worship, or takes sides favouring one equally petty, narrow- minded tribe over another, but it is far from obvious that the claim that God isn’t subject to change or lacks distinguishing properties fares any better. The problem here is to explain how this God can be as transcendent as you claim and yet not dissolve into meaningless abstractions. Unfortunately, to the extent that you attempt this impossible task, all you do is appeal to even more meaninglessness propositions. If God can’t change, He must therefore be unfeeling and unable to be aware of contingent truths, you argue?   Hart: It’s just that “his knowledge or bliss or love does not involve any metaphysical change in him” (p.137). God therefore can’t act in the world, nor can He be free, you say?   Hart: God’s “creative intention… can be understood as an eternal act that involves no temporal change within him.

"Tom,   ""Because you are unable to entertain any other ideas""   I entertained the idea that maybe Aquinas had some kind of sound argument.      Then I analyzed the First Way in detail, its premises, and its logical structure.      I identified several false premises and multiple instances of invalid logic in the First Way.      Recall, the First Way is ""The first and more manifest way"", in other words, Aquinas led with his best, his strongest, argument.      If the First Way is unsound then the foundation of A-T is unsound.      The First Way is unsound.      The human body, which is used in an example of objects not being able to move themselves, does in fact move itself, so Aquinas presents a false premise there.      An object in motion does not move ""only"" because it is being moved by another, since an object in inertial motion is not being moved by another, so there is another false premise by Aquinas.      When Aquinas says ""because then there would be no first mover"" he is begging the question by using the conclusion of the argument as a premise in the argument.      The First Way is founded on the false premise that absent an external mover a moving object will slow and stop and its motion will be lost and disappear from the universe.      Aquinas employs a false dichotomy between an infinite hierarchical regress or a finite hierarchical regress terminating in a single first mover, neglecting the third alternative of a circular regress terminating finitely in a multitude of mutual movers.      The last clause ""; and this everyone understands to be God."" is logically invalid in that there is no logical connection with the prior argument.      Koons has identified the lack of connection between god and the rest of the argument as the ""gap"" problem, in other words, the non-sequitur logical fallacy.      The argument from motion is based on what is ""evident to our senses, that in the world some things are in motion"", thus, physics. Koons tries to make some rather weak points that A-T is compatible with QM. Bmiller above kindly provided a link to an old Feser post wherein Feser argues for compatibility between inertial motion and a first mover.

" _The original spiritual war was between God & Satan and then God created man; and so the spiritual war continues. As man is below the nature of an angel, Satan is enraged to think that humans can be given Divine Life in their souls, an act of God’s pure love and mercy for us. _      According to some authors, Satan's primary outrage was in apprehending that God would unite Himself to _human_ nature (not to an angelic nature) and that a human being would be elevated _above the angels_ in the order of grace. I.E. Mary.      I don't know if they are just speculating on this, or even merely proposing it as one way to explain Satan's rebellion. I suspect that some of the authors who propose it do so out of a conceit in their own hearts: since (in this account) God's foreseen action makes man _special_ : even Satan's sin must be centered on man's special role. I say this because Satan's sin - if right described above - is one of pride, in that he was unwilling to see angels below a mere creature composed of body and soul. But such pride in a being, once you grant that Satan was going to be proud, _needs no intervening object_ about which to be proud, than his OWN being and his relation to God: Satan could be proud by refusing to accept his dependency on God _without_ any further need of considering Satan's relation to other beings. Parsimony of hypothesis does not require us to lever in Satan considering _some third party_ to the matter, in order to find room for pride.",original spiritual war god satan god created man spiritual war continues man nature angel satan enraged think human given divine life soul act pure love mercy u according author primary outrage apprehending god would unite human nature angelic nature human would elevated angel order grace ie mary know speculating even merely proposing one way explain rebellion suspect author propose conceit heart since account foreseen action make man special even sin must centered special role say sin - right described - one pride unwilling see angel mere creature composed body soul pride grant satan going proud need intervening object proud relation god satan could proud refusing accept dependency god without need considering relation being parsimony hypothesis require u lever satan considering third party matter order find room pride,feser,1489,0,454

"@ Walter Van den Acker,      The little logic puzzles that you are setting are tricks that you are playing on yourself.      ""If logic is contingent, so is God, because the proposition 'God exists' is, in that case, a contingent truth.""      Contingent logic and contingent truth are not the same thing. Logic is a procedure that, properly used, takes us from one truth to another. Contingent truth is not absolute truth. ""It takes an hour to swim across the lake"", depends on the lake, the person swimming, and other contingent factors. God knows all the contingencies. They are in the infinite sequence which is contingent to us, but not to God, who is absolute truth. Furthermore, the infinite sequence is an _image_ of God, a Divine Idea, meaning that God knows it. But an image of God is not God any more than the pixels in your digital photo of a tree are the tree. You cannot say that the tree does not have sap because the photo does not have sap. Similarly, you cannot say that God is contingent from the entertainment of an image of God. The image does not show what God is, but it shows what you cannot say that God is not. Because people, made in the image of God, can be stupid does not imply that God is stupid.      God has no procedure of using logic. God knows the procedure of logic that you use. He created it. That procedure, properly used, is whatever God wills it to be. Whatever he wills it to be, it still allows humans to reason from one contingent truth to another within the composite contingent truths that humans understand.      ""Your account of free will means that you can turn into an atheist tomorrow and I can turn into a theist, because that happens to be an unbiased bit of both our 'wills.'

For example, if you had never seen the color red, you might naturally ask precisely a question like the second one. And if someone then showed you a red object, you would surely think that your question had been answered. Or, if someone said “Well, it’s sort of like seeing dark orange, though not quite.

"This is the right approach, however, from what I've read so far it's overcomplicated by Aristotle and Aquinas. The Greek model for human rights is not universal but tied to the idea of AUTOCHTHONY and would JUSTIFY chattel slavery.   Paul addressed AUTOCHTHONY directly in his Mars hill discourse in Acts 17 countering the dispute concerning birth from a particular area to one BLOOD, in law a common human consanguinity which having the evidence of mixed races or ethnicities is evidence of common humanity due therefore common equity (dikaiosune, see Aristotle BOOK 5 NICHOMACHEAN ETHICS).   He then established the common observation that in one theos all live and move and have being which relates back to the first observation that they had many gods each of which protected certain classes of rights when given obeisance. The unknown one Theos being the god upon whom even the other gods demiurgos we're dependent.   Then he established the ideal judge who could advocate the natural rights of those in the image of the invisible Theos who is not in the image or location chosen by men but has established equity in the image of God in the god man in whom are all actual subjective rights obvious by natural law made objective because HE will judge in that equity, justice, righteousness, dikaiosune, mishpat and God has given proof of this by raising him from the dead signifying he is eternal and has the power over life and death for all in his image.   Paul draws this human rights argument directly from the old testament description of messiah the Christ not Greek philosophy he has simply explained it so that greeks could understand it. This is the same structure used in the prologue to John's Gospel, beginning with IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE LOGOS, the logos became flesh, that becoming flesh gave us equity and the authority to claim the title of an inheritance of rights i.e THE SONS OF GOD, our duty then, his law is to love and protect the legitimate rights of others as we love and protect our own rights, knowing these rights came from God by grace and the truth concerning the fact of the matter that is the Christ.   I don't see how philosophy can improve on this although it may help to understand it, but it doesn't improve upon but rather is corrected by the new testament based on the two great commandments with respect to God's rights and our rights in common as neighbors and the explanation in the prophets such as ISAIAH who goes into great detail on the subject of equity of rights in the human image of God YHVHJESUS.

When I use necessary here, I mean it purely in that it seems necessary in order to achieve God’s plan, which is at least in part to create children who choose to be as like Him, and can therefore participate with Him in the Trinity. That is an astounding thing, a top down view of the telos of the universe.      Arguing what is necessary from a bottom up perspective in the way that philosophers tend to, in terms of what God could and could not do, is like ants on a cathedral wall arguing about the cathedral’s architecture and construction. Yes they are builders themselves and so know something of building, but it’s several orders of magnitude higher in it’s nature than ants are capable of conceiving. So if Brunelleschi was able to hear the ants debate, he would perhaps smile, but he would not bother trying to reveal the answers to their ponderings as it would just not make sense to them.

"@Talmid      Hey bro! I said that they are 'materialists' not in the technical sense, but because of the consequences. Because for materialists in the technical sense - if they are to be coherent at all - they should say that people do not exist. But in the buddhist sense, not only people do not exist and there is just suffering but the world is always trying to deceive you. I don't need to canvas it more for you to see how much worse it is. There is simply no happiness at all and no one to see any good of it. It seems that ideology takes all of the best in the world and turn it into misery.      In the cellphone example, they somehow believe in regularities but, as far as I understand, they are very close to the Humean causality type - or proto- humean. They say that causality is in some sense mind only or something we 'associate' but it's in some sense not really there (I think that's somehow related to why they are nominalists too). If this is coherent at the end of the day (I think that it's not) is another story - and that's what I want to know because something as evil as that CAN'T BE REAL.      During these years I tried to formulate ways in showing how that can't be true - I will put them in the other post. But man the problem is even if I somehow 'showed' that, I can't prove it to myself. You may think how that's possible but the problem is the OCD - this thing keeps hitting my head 24/7 and it seems that I can't go further. Since you don't have it I can describe that it hits differently. Looks like my arguments are always wrong or that they will have somehow a way to evade it. For people that do not have it, it seems ridiculous, but for me, it hits really hard to the point that doesn't matter how I try to formulate it, and I always forget the rest of the arguments and need to repeat them to myself. It looks like hell because I'm never out of the same place and looks like I learn nothing - just keep suffering.      I will try to formulate all the points that give me hope that demonic ideology (buddhism) is wrong in the open-topic post. I will try to put my best in there and try to be coherent all the way through. Maybe someone sees the effort I put in all these years trying to save myself from this miserable condition that I am in and hopefully helps me to get rid of that demonic ideology once and for all.

" _If God knew the catastrophic consequences of original sin (and he did know) why did he create man in the first place?_      Because creating man was good? Is that not a reason? To be more specific: Because creating creatures able to know and love God is a _very great good_.      _It seems self-defeating and cruel._      The good of a good act is not SIMPLY canceled by evil of a later pain suffered. The good act is (and remains) _a good_.      There are different **orders** of good, as well: The good of an act of charity is not of the same order of good as the good of health, nor of the evil of pain and illness, the act of charity is in principle a higher-order good that cannot be canceled by pain and suffering.      The _degree_ of evil of an act of malice does reside in the same order as the degree of good of an act of love. But the good that X agent does is not canceled out by the evil that Y agent does.      If you want to know whether there is, on balance, more good in the acts of love in the world, than evil in the acts of malice, the answer is easy: there is more good in the acts of love.

" _If a human on this Earth can choose a lesser good instead of a greater good, that is a imperfection._      A lamb which is killed by a lion for food is an imperfect lamb, also.      As I already indicated, the state of a man on Earth able to sin _is indeed_ less complete and less perfect than his state in heaven, when he is no longer able to sin, (though he has MORE, not less, freedom). This lesser sort of perfection may be called ""imperfection"" in one sense, or it may be called a ""more limited"" condition that is _proper to one still in this life_ : Either way, one must keep the _sense_ being used clear. Hence, one cannot employ the position that our ""being able to sin"" represents an ""imperfection"" and conclude that this contradicts Genesis saying that when God made the world, it was ""good"" because man able to sin is ""not good"". That doesn't follow. A lamb is able to die, and that's a lack of divine perfection (for God cannot die), but it's a kind of ""im""perfection that is more properly understood as a _lesser kind_ of perfection. And God intended a universe filled with beings which are imperfect compared to Him, because it is impossible for Him to have created beings that are uncreated perfection. He also intended a universe with men who were capable of sin who then could achieve later the condition of the Beatific Vision and no longer able to sin, by way of meritorious acts of love of God made even IN the condition of able to sin.

"The theodicy problem is meaningless because it is based on contradictory premises. God is not omnipotent in a potential sense, but in an actual sense: nothing can exist without him. But because of the incomprehensibility of God it is not possible to draw any conclusions from analogous statements about God, how the world has to be or what may happen in it. And God's goodness does not have its measure in our earthly well-being, but consists in the fact that we are taken up into the love of the Father for the Son, which is the Holy Spirit. No power of the world can separate us from God. Thus, faith changes the our experience of the world because suffering and death no longer have the last word.

" _""In response, Davies points out, first, that creating freely simply does not in fact entail changing. Certainly it simply begs the question to assume otherwise.

What Davies is saying here is that creating freely doesn't entail changing because god doesn't change and yet creates freely. Davies is already assuming that god can create freely, which is what he is supposed to show is possible if God is unchanging.       _""Second, Davies notes that in order to show that an eternal and immutable God’s act of creation would be unfree, one would have to show that there is something either internal to God’s nature or external to him that compels him to create._ ""      The thing that is internal to Him that ""compels"" Him to create is His nature. It is the same thing that""compels"" God not to lie.      Davies' third objection actually shows the exact opposite of what he is trying to claim.   If God doesn't use a process of ""figuring out"", that means that His will of creation is eternally present.

"Kant took the emergent sense of self of his era, and made it the seat of all knowledge. He first promulgated the belief that it is the subject (the viewer) that is central to knowledge, and not the object viewed. Socratics believed that truth was a quality that existed outside of human perception. It was a philosopher’s job to search it out. Plato, unwittingly, gave a demonstration of this in his famous parable about shadows in a cave that we have touched on. People are chained to a cave wall and can see only shadows thrown from objects passing before a fire behind them. Since this is all they ever see, they will mistake the shadows for reality. In this example, perception is not the seat of knowledge at all, but instead a false prophet. Truth does not exist in the perception of the person in the cave, but is an independent quality that is outside not only the viewer’s perception, but also outside the cave itself. Jesus took this a step further in describing truth not as a quality, but as a god, as independent from a man’s perception as it is possible to be. Truth was God, and came from God, and it was our job to accept God and His will for us. Saint Paul, foremost architect of the Christian church, anticipates Kant’s description of spiritual truth as something outside of sensory perception in I Corinthians Chapter 2: “We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, ... Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared”. In Paul’s view, we don’t get knowledge of God through our senses, but “God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.” Truth is truly outside of ourselves, and absolutely outside of our perception. It must be revealed by God. “Now we have received … the spirit which is of God; that we might know … not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth”. In this case, a viewer’s perception is useless, for truth can be known only through revelation to the spirit. Kant turned this around to teach that we cannot truly know any object outside of ourselves. All we can know is our view of that object. Thus, all knowledge is contingent on the subject, or subjective. There is no truth that we can find in an object, because we see that object only through our view. We see only our piece of it. From this point, he built a philosophical system which used scientific observation as a lens to determine what we can know, how we can know it, and how we learn it and describe it. At the same time, Kant held on to the notion that there may be truth that is outside of our ability to observe its phenomena, and so prove it. In fact, Kant felt he had proved that there were phenomena that did not have any observable traces, and so could not be known. He used the origin of matter in the universe as an example. It is here. It had to get here from somewhere, but where did it come from? Everything we can sense has an action and reaction. Everything has a start. So, what about matter? In short, Kant proved that we see things subjectively, but went on to show that this does not mean that objective truth does not exist, but only that we cannot observe objective truth, since we cannot observe the object itself. I will give you a CliffsNotes version to say that Kant built a science-based philosophy that still left room for Saint Paul’s belief that God’s truth could not come to us through our senses, but only through revelation.",kant took emergent sense self era made seat knowledge first promulgated belief subject viewer central knowledge object viewed socratics believed truth quality existed outside human perception job search plato unwittingly gave demonstration famous parable shadow cave touched people chained cave wall see shadow thrown object passing fire behind since ever see mistake shadow reality example perception seat knowledge instead false prophet truth exist perception person cave independent quality outside perception also outside cave jesus took step describing truth quality god independent perception possible truth god came god job accept god u saint paul foremost architect christian church anticipates description spiritual truth something outside sensory perception corinthian chapter “ we speak wisdom god mystery even hidden wisdom eye hath seen ear heard neither entered heart man thing god hath prepared ” view get knowledge god sens “ god hath revealed unto u spirit ” truth truly outside absolutely outside perception must revealed god “ now received … spirit god might know … word wisdom teacheth holy ghost teacheth ” case perception useless truth known revelation spirit kant turned around teach can not truly know object outside know view object thus knowledge contingent subject subjective truth find object see object view see piece point built philosophical system used scientific observation lens determine know know learn describe time kant held notion may truth outside ability observe phenomenon prove fact kant felt proved phenomenon observable trace could known used origin matter universe example get somewhere come everything sense action reaction everything start matter short kant proved see thing subjectively went show mean objective truth exist can not observe objective truth since can not observe object give cliffsnotes version say kant built science-based philosophy still left room saint belief truth could come u sens revelation,feser,3476,0,529

It is simply a fact that on matters of history - which the condemnation of Honorius is - it is in no way impious to judge that the Council was wrong. One should do it respectfully, as the Saints Dr. Feser references do, but you can absolutely question such judgments. If that were not so, then Maximos, Bellarmie, and Alphonsus Liguori wouldn't question it.      For example, Trent says that their teaching on indulgences goes back to the time of the Apostles*.

"""one example sometimes given to explain a formal distinction is like the angles and sides of a triangle; it's logically impossible for any of them to exist separately from the other, so they're part of one being, but they're not the exact same thing either.""      So? A real distinction doesn't imply separability. Thomists are very insistent upon this point - for example, with the essence and existence distinction. They are really distinct, but not separable.      If the angles and sides of a triangle are truly distinct, then they are really distinct. Even if one is always necessarily co-instantiated with the other. I still see no merit in formal distinctions: it still strikes me as a completely confused notion. Either a distinction is real or purely logical in some way.      ""The attributes can neither exist independently of God, nor can God be without them as if the accidents could be removed and just cease to exist upon removal""      Fine, but if the distinction between attributes is a real one it will still fall prey to Aquinas's arguments.

"@RunDec I wonder if stochasticism can still be connected to LFW insofar as it's often easy to predict what a person will do when faced with a set of choices due to pre-existing inclinations that strongly incline him one way or the other.      An inclination towards one particular thing can be very strong to the point where a person could basically choose that object almost every time basically, as long as the person still has the ability to choose differently, even though it's harder.      Heck, I lean towards thinking that even if an individual always chose the same object every single time, with a very strong inclination, that still wouldn't be a problem for LFW, because the concept of being able to choose differently is distinct from how many times one does so.      One could thereby rewind the tape of time / reality indefinitely many times and get the same choice made by a person, without this in any way undermining LFW.      On a different note, here's an objection to LFW I once saw that I'd like to know your thoughts on:      The idea of self-explaining sui generis choices are actually gibberish even with LFW. If my free choice is sufficient to explain itself to the exclusion of other possibilities, it isn't indeterministic.

"But it gets even worse than that for Walford and O’Regan. For it’s not just that popes _might, in theory_ , err on a matter of faith or morals when not speaking _ex cathedra_. It’s that this _has in fact happened_ , albeit in only a handful of cases. As already noted, even Walford admits that John XXII erred (and Walford fails to explain why the qualification this requires him to make to his position does not entirely undermine it). But the most spectacular example is that of Pope Honorius, whose ambiguous words at the very least gave aid and comfort to the Monothelite heresy. And two papally-approved councils of the Church accused him of worse than that, insofar as they condemned him for holding to this doctrinal error himself.

"UncommonDescent,      ""Because as I have said earlier, knowledge about the world (for us) is mediated by matter (we are obviously not angelic creatures). We have to work, and work hard to get to the essence of things.""      But that doesn't answer my question. Why isn't immateriality good enough to save us from this work? You imply matter guides us in the right direction (if we pay it proper attention), but why doesn't that immaterial part of us do that instead? I want to know what you think immateriality brings to the table. I suppose you could say the immaterial part of us is what makes us want to learn from matter in the proper way. But some people learn improper lessons. So what is different in the two people? How are we to decide which aspect of the whole is untrustworthy?      I agree ""important"" and ""only source of knowledge"" are not the same thing. But I don't claim empiricism is the only source for knowledge. I know a beautiful woman when I see one but I don't see how I could have learned this. A rudimentary selection process must have existed in my head No random series of images (empirical data) could have done that.      I claim empiricism is the most reliable, most objective source of knowledge we know of. I don't worship at its feet.         ""The problem is that, according to materialism, we can not escape the filter. There's no vantage point from which to test what passes the filter vs. what is beyond it. ""      That's not exactly the way this materialist sees it. We are able to design instruments that are far superior to our senses. We do this because we know we have limitations. The instruments are a common denominator among observers. We have learned that the instruments are far more objective than our personal experience. Prior to that we have learned that many eyes on a subject are better than one pair of eyes. We can reach agreements because we know each individual might get it wrong while an agreeing group of individuals is more likely to be correct. But even that group has to yield to instrument data and rigorous measurements when that is possible. They do not have to yield to well constructed logical/reasoned arguments. Even the best of those are notoriously unreliable.         ""How can we know that causation is not an illusion (another one) foisted upon us by evolutionary processes?""      We do not have to know in the omniscient sense. We have to know what works to get us what we want. If we want to get to the moon, we rely on an understanding of causation that gets us there. Could this understanding be wrong or incomplete at some fundamental level? It probably is. Nevertheless, it's right enough to get us to the moon.      Oppose that to the fancy reasoning that gets us to immateriality. How do we know this is not an illusion? What harm does it cause us to assume the conclusion is an illusion? It won't cause us to miss the moon.This is always going to be my ultimate standard. So I, as a materialist, temporarily ignore the part that could be an illusion and stick with the part that is highly unlikely to be an illusion.         ""What does 'rockness' mean? And if a rock changes 'nanosecond by nanosecond', how can it persist?""      Rockness means what we agree it means at the time. Yes, it's possible that this agreement will vanish at some point.

It does not have to be a permanent rock for us to talk about it or skip it off a pond today. It's not the agreement on the words ""science"" or ""evolution"" that's important.

"@ StardustyPsyche,      Your whole stance is based on prejudice.

You seem to think that logic is some absolute supporting your prejudice rather than:      1\. - something that is argued about to this day and that becomes more complex continuously, and      2\. - something invented for proper human use as an exemplary divine idea.      All bodies in temporal motion radiate energy as multi polar radiators and lose orbital motion, thus energy, and come to a natural state of rest. Nothing you say demonstrates that, should an orbit be sustained, it could not be by a prime mover. There is no inconsistency.      As for ""Carrasquillo"", I don't much care what he says.      ""Aristotle was fundamentally wrong in asserting that sublunary motion is in an impeding medium""      It _is_ in an impeding medium.      ""he discounted the notion of the void, thinking, among other things, that speed would go to infinity absent the sublunary impeding medium""      Absent the impeding medium which removes energy from objects in motion, a continuing force would cause the speed to go to infinity. According to special relativity, the distance between the body moved and things which it approaches in the direction of motion grows to zero as the limiting velocity of light is approached. In fact, the first evidence that neutrinos had rest mass was that they changed type as they passed through the Earth, indicating that they did not ""see"" 0 distance in the diameter of the Earth.      These things were not understood by Aristotle and Aquinas as some ""magical"" prophetic power about future science. The reasoning was from a completely different direction and that their direction of thought led to true natural theology is strongly indicated by modern science's actual non-contradiction of their results.

"On internalist consequentalism, where the right action is defined by expected utilities, we would expect that if both sides are unbiased investigators, in most of the games, at least one side would at take the expected utility of the other side’s winning to be higher. For if both sides are perfect investigators with the same evidence and perfect priors, then they will assign the same expected utilities, and so at least one side will take the other’s to have higher expected utility, except in the rare case where the two expected utilities are equal. And if both sides assign expected utilities completely at random, but unbiasedly (i.e., are just as likely to assign a higher expected utility to the other side winning as to themselves), then bracketing the rare case where a side assigns equal expected utility to both victory options, any given side will have a probability of about a half of assigning higher expected utility to the other side’s victory, and so there will be about a 3/4 chance that at least one side will take the other side’s victory to be more likely. And other cases of unbiased investigators will likely fall somewhere between the perfect case and the random case, and so we would expect that in most games, at least one side will be playing for an outcome that they think has lower expected utility.",internalist consequentalism right action defined expected utility would expect side unbiased investigator game least one side would take expected utility winning higher side perfect investigator evidence perfect prior assign expected utility least one side take higher expected utility except rare case two expected utility equal side assign expected utility completely random unbiasedly ie likely assign higher expected utility side winning bracketing rare case side assigns equal expected utility victory option given side probability half assigning higher expected utility victory chance least one side take victory likely case unbiased investigator likely fall somewhere perfect case random case would expect game least one side playing outcome think lower expected utility,pruss,1330,1,577

"Splendid! Finally an actual argument.      Let’s recap: your initial claim is that the logical problem of evil provides good philosophical reasons not to believe in the God of classical theism because it shows there is no way to reconcile the bad things that happen to people with “Omni” attributes we want to affirm about God.      A response to this claim was then given that one possible “out” that can preserve these divine attributes by hypothesizing that God could make restitution to the wronged parties in the next life.      You then made a bunch of irrelevant remarks about how everyone who disagrees with you on this topic is stupid, and most people probably gave up on the conversation. But now we actually have a non-trivial and non-circular response! An immortal soul cannot exist that survives after death because we don’t know how a soul interacts with the brain, so it is therefore impossible for God to offer restitution to a person after death.      Now that we have that all our of the way, ready for the philosophy? You sure? Ok here it is:      I reject your premise. An unsolved question is not a demonstration that two concepts are incompatible.      This is further justified by the arguments that Dr. Feser has made here (and others have made elsewhere) that the mind cannot be wholly materially determinate, and that there must be an immaterial component to our thoughts (which is positive evidence for the soul).

For practical purposes, “matter” came to be treated as just whatever accepted physical theories happen to say about it.

"I agree with Walter. It seems to me that 2 is more directly incompatible with God's atemporality than with his lack of complexity as such. An atemporal God who sees Creation across its history in toto as a block, whether He is simple or complex, has only true beliefs about everything that has been or will be, and about when each fact will be true for finite creatures who are temporal. But his beliefs don't change.      Although a God who changed with and experienced time such that his beliefs also changed might be thus considered complex across time by having temporal parts, that would seem to be assuming an A-theory of time for all (including God), then importing a B perspective at the end, incoherently. So, simplicity of essence (at any point in time) and atemporality could be distinguished I suppose, such that a person could affirm both simplicity and temporality of God.

"Walter,      Libertarian freedom entails that you can, at the same time, have non- determining reasons for doing X and non-determining reasons for not-doing-X. What is the intention, beyond the choosing of one over the other? It is when you intend (and hence have chosen) to do one instead of the other, and thus are ready intending the action. If the intention is not the choice, then it would be the motivation. And in both cases there is no difference between our case of LFW and God's:      Before I finally make my choice, I have motivations for X and ~X. In w1 I go on to choose X; in w2 I go on to choose ~X. And yet there is no difference in my intrinsic properties between w1 and w2.      This is what is weird in LFW, but as explained, it is the same for God as well as for us. So this is no objection against divine simplicity per se.      But perhaps you think that the ""intention"" is neither the choosing nor the motivation, but an accompanying mental state that is always present when, and only when, a choice is made. In that case, the intention would NOT be a necessary condition for a choice being made. Because if it were, we would never be able to choose anything, since we would have to choose our intention before being able to make a choice, and that is circular or regressive. I can, under motivations for both X and ~X, and with no intention whatsoever (since I haven't made the choice yet), choose to do X or ~X and thus effectively, freely bring about X or ~X without this ""intention"" entity/property. So God's having or not having an intention in this case would be irrelevant for his power to choose, but it ALSO is the same for us.      But if the the problem is that God must be different when he chooses X as opposed to ~X, then again this would not work under libertarian freedom for us as either. Because (again) when you choose between X (in w1) or ~X (in w2), the cause of your choice has exactly the same intrinsic properties between worlds. The cause of your choosing X in w1 is you at t in state S; and the cause of your choosing ~X in w2 is you at t in state S. There is a branching, and yet there is no difference in intrinsic properties of you at t between worlds. So, once again: it is the same for us and God, and libertarian freedom does not require subjects to change in intrinsic properties between worlds in order to make choices.",walter libertarian freedom entail time non- determining reason x non-determining reason not-doing-x intention beyond choosing one intend hence chosen one instead thus ready intending action intention choice would motivation case difference case lfw finally make choice motivation x x w go choose x w go choose x yet difference intrinsic property w w weird lfw explained god well u objection divine simplicity per se perhaps think intention neither choosing motivation accompanying mental state always present choice made case intention would necessary condition choice made would never able choose anything since would choose intention able make choice circular regressive motivation x x intention whatsoever since made choice yet choose x x thus effectively freely bring x x without intention entityproperty intention case would irrelevant power choose also u problem god must different chooses x opposed x would work libertarian freedom u either choose x w x w cause choice exactly intrinsic property world cause choosing x w state cause choosing x w state branching yet difference intrinsic property world u god libertarian freedom require subject change intrinsic property world order make choice,feser,2377,0,597

If ye require God to do X yer imposing a duty on Him.      Job 41:11 is rather clear. As is the rest of Scholastic      >Someone who loves, say, a child or spouse in need, ideally doesn't say, Well, I guess I am obligated to help out right now.      Here is a blatant example of Theistic Anthropomorphism and comparing God to creatures univocally.      No such ""god"" exists mae boi. That is not the God of the Bible or Classic Theism but I just repeated myself.      >I should think that perfect love goes beyond what is owed.      That manifests itself in God creating us in the first place and giving all rational beings sufficient grace to be saved. He owes ye no more than that and God doesn't even owe that. God could have not created you or chosen to save you from yer sins which are solely yer own fault.      >The force of the evidential PoE, then, doesn't come from a claim that God owes moral duties.      No it entirely presupposes that as Davies showed in his analysis of Rowe.      God has no emotions. That is God has no passions. Emotive appeals are anthropomorphic.      I hate theistic anthropomorphism with the fire of 10000 suns as I hate all idolatry.      God is metaphysically God and ontologically God only.

"Ed:       **""For example, when we apply Newton’s laws to the solar system, we do so by modeling the latter (in terms of a system of point masses orbiting a larger point mass, and so on). In this way, our application of abstractions is mediated by further abstractions.""**      It occurs to me that fact is itself presents a pretty solid argument that hylomorphism or something like it must be true.      If material objects did not have form as per hylomorphism, we would have a vicious infinite regress of mediating abstractions, with no way of ""connecting"" the mathematical representation to the things being represented. It is only because material objects do have that abstract component - the forms that they instantiate - that mathematical equations and other abstractions can be meaningfully applied to them at all.      But at the same time, if material objects were pure abstraction, there would be no such need to mediate between the abstract model and the concrete material thing, because there would BE no concrete material thing. There would only be the abstraction itself, and the hence the ""right"" equations would simply be identical to the material objects rather than modeling them.      So the very act of mathematical modeling implicitly requires that all material things are composites of matter and form as per hylomorphic dualism.",ed example apply law solar system modeling latter term system point mass orbiting larger point mass way application abstraction mediated abstraction occurs fact present pretty solid argument hylomorphism something like must true material object form per hylomorphism would vicious infinite regress mediating abstraction way connecting mathematical representation thing represented material object abstract component - form instantiate - mathematical equation abstraction meaningfully applied time material object pure abstraction would need mediate abstract model concrete material thing would concrete material thing would abstraction hence right equation would simply identical material object rather modeling act mathematical modeling implicitly requires material thing composite matter form per hylomorphic dualism,feser,1352,0,626
"Melkman, you seem to be fusing two different issues: the first is the difference between material heresy and formal heresy. Material heresy is believing X when the Church has taught not-X. You can do this by merely NOT KNOWING that the Church has taught not-X. Formal heresy adds to the material heresy the necessary spiritual ingredient of holding the proposition X obstinately, in the face of the Church's teaching, being aware _that the Church teaches not-X_. This is the sin of heresy in its formal aspect.      Then there is another distinction, having the sin of heresy, versus the ecclesiastical crime of heresy. If you obstinately hold X, but _never tell or act on that belief_ , you could not be held guilty in a Church court for the ecclesiastical crime, because there would be no knowledge of the fact. So your heresy could become publicly declared. So it would not be ""formally"" determined heresy, by which you mean "" **officially** NAMED 'the sin of heresy' by the Church"".      And then there is the distinction between holding an X where the Church has taught not-X, but in which not-X is _not a formally defined dogma to be affirmed with Catholic faith, or a definitive teaching ""to be held"" unreservedly_ but a lesser position, taught (""merely"") as a firm tradition. While a Church court might find you guilty of some crime or other in publicly asserting X, it wouldn't necessarily be that of ""heresy"" as defined in the canons. For the latter, the teaching of not-X must be a definitive one, a teaching on which the Church has **definitively** resolved the debate. So, you could be found obstinately sinful in holding error, but not that of "" **formally defined** "" error.      Your point seems to be that even if the position stated by Honorius was actually material heresy, (a) maybe he wasn't guilty of the obstinacy necessary for the sin, and (b) nobody in the Church could have successfully carried out an ecclesiastical trial to _determine_ his guilty status so that it could be OFFICIALLY DECLARED to be ""heresy"" to all. erick below points out the additional issue that the true answer had not yet been defined.      To all of this, I will submit: the point of this post is not to answer whether a pope might be _officially declared_ a heretic, or whether a pope might hold a position that had already been _officially defined_ to be wrong, but to discuss whether a pope might ever hold (and teach) what is, materially, erroneous, on faith and morals; and do so when he _should have known better_ even if the Church had not yet officially defined the issue.",melkman seem fusing two different issue first difference material heresy formal heresy material heresy believing x church taught not-x merely knowing church taught not-x formal heresy add material heresy necessary spiritual ingredient holding proposition x obstinately face teaching aware church teach not-x sin heresy formal aspect another distinction sin heresy versus ecclesiastical crime heresy obstinately hold x never tell act belief could held guilty church court ecclesiastical crime would knowledge fact heresy could become publicly declared would formally determined heresy mean officially named sin church distinction holding x church taught not-x not-x formally defined dogma affirmed catholic faith definitive teaching held unreservedly lesser position taught merely firm tradition church court might find guilty crime publicly asserting x necessarily heresy defined canon latter teaching not-x must definitive one teaching church definitively resolved debate could found obstinately sinful holding error formally defined error point seems even position stated honorius actually material heresy maybe guilty obstinacy necessary sin b nobody church could successfully carried ecclesiastical trial determine guilty status could officially declared heresy erick point additional issue true answer yet defined submit point post answer whether pope might officially declared heretic whether pope might hold position already officially defined wrong discus whether pope might ever hold teach materially erroneous faith moral known better even church yet officially defined issue,feser,2581,0,627

"(From 2 of Lewis's other books.)         (Miracles, Chapter 11 ""God and 'Religion'"") (By 'Religion' Lewis means Pantheism).      (Quote)   ""The error which I am here trying to correct is one of the most sincere and respectable errors in the world; I have sympathy enough with it to feel shocked at the language I have been driven to use in stating the opposite view, which I believe to be the true one. To say that God ‘is a particular Thing’ does seem to obliterate the immeasurable difference not only between what He is and what all other things are but between the very mode of His existence and theirs. I must at once restore the balance by insisting that derivative things, from atoms to archangels, hardly attain to existence at all in comparison with their Creator. Their principle of existence is not in themselves. You can distinguish what they are from the fact that they are. The definition of them can be understood and a clear idea of them formed without even knowing whether they are. Existence is an ‘opaque’ addition to the idea of them. But with God it is not so: if we fully understood what God is we should see that there is no question whether He is. It would always have been impossible that He should not exist. He is the opaque centre of all existences, the thing that simply and entirely is, the fountain of facthood"".   (End quote)         The last quote is from Lewis's commentary on the nature psalms in the O.T.   All of the Scripture references in the beginning of the quote are from the Psalms.      (Reflections on the Psalms, Chapter 8 ""Nature"")   (Quote)   ""But of course the (Jewish) doctrine of Creation leaves Nature full of manifestations which show the presence of God, and created energies which serve Him. The light is His garment, the thing we partially see Him through (104:2), the thunder can be His voice (29:3–5). He dwells in the dark thundercloud (18:11), the eruption of a volcano comes in answer to His touch (104:32). The world is full of his emissaries and executors. He makes winds His messengers and flames His servants (104:4), rides upon cherubim (18:10), commands the army of angels.   All this is of course in one way very close to Paganism. Thor and Zeus also spoke in the thunder; Hermes or Iris was the messenger of the gods. But the difference, though subtle, is momentous, between hearing in the thunder the voice of God or the voice of a god. As we have seen, even in the creation- myths, gods have beginnings. Most of them have fathers and mothers; often we know their birthplaces. There is no question of self-existence or the timeless. Being is imposed upon them, as upon us, by preceding causes. They are, like us, creatures or products; though they are luckier than we in being stronger, more beautiful, and exempt from death. They are, like us, actors in the cosmic drama, not its authors. Plato fully understood this. His God creates the gods and preserves them from death by His own power; they have no inherent immortality. In other words, the difference between believing in God and in many gods is not one of arithmetic. As someone has said ‘gods’ is not really the plural of God; God has no plural. Thus, when you hear in the thunder the voice of a god, you are stopping short, for the voice of a god is not really a voice from beyond the world, from the uncreated. By taking the god’s voice away—or envisaging the god as an angel, a servant of that Other—you go further. The thunder becomes not less divine but more.

"Tom,   Material interactions are net lossless.      When 2 blobs of putty splat their motion seems to be lost. That is a core misunderstanding of Aristotle that makes the argument from motion, the First Way, unsound.      I left it to the reader to understand the generalized sense of the word ""motion"" in this context, but I see that was not to be. More specifically, the kinetic energy of the blobs of putty is not lost, only transformed. For example, one of the simplest transformations to realize is that the kinetic energy of motion of the blobs of putty, considered as whole objects, is transformed into the kinetic energy of molecular motion, what we call heat.      The same holds true for any observable process that seems to require a continual input of energy to keep it going. What appears to be what we now know as frictional losses are not actually net losses at all. You can get a sense of this by simply rubbing your hands together, whereby the energy needed to move your hands against an apparent resistance is transformed into heat, which is the energy of molecular motion.      Aristotle had the mistaken notion that objects would slow and stop and their motion would be lost, and this leads to an argument for a first mover. While it is true that the obvious movement of an object will stop absent an external mover to keep it going, what Aristotle failed to realize is that the energy of the motion of the observed object was in fact transformed into other forms of energy in a net lossless transformation.      Because there is no net loss of material, that is matter/energy that are equivalent, there is no necessity for a first mover to sustain our world of observed motions.      ""...completely CONSISTENT with it.""   The First Way is not an argument for CONSISTENCEY, rather, the First Way is an argument for NECESSITY.      One can concoct an unbounded number of unevidenced speculations that are CONSISTENT with modern physics, no prizes for such fanciful prattle.      ""Therefore it is necessary to arrive at a first mover"" is what Aquinas claimed. That claim is unsound because the First Way employs multiple false premises as an argument for the NESESSITY of a first mover, and is logically invalid as an argument for the existence of god.

"@ Walter Van den Acker,      ""Please continu""      Well then, the simplicity of a random number is greater than the simplicity of science, logic, or mathematics. The XOR process is meant to show that even a finite random sequence can mean any predetermined thing, but we cannot unravel its intended meaning, except by luck, and even then, there is no way to know that the lucky guess was correct, because it could mean anything that would fit against its length, as I wrote earlier.      The logic that you and I use, as expressed by Aristotle, is complex. The rules of inference are ordered and detailed in a complex way that cannot be reduced to the simplicity of a random number, which yet contains them if it is long enough, as I described. I earlier described how 2+2 could easily be made equal to 3 as shown by video games running a sequence that displays such things on a screen (ask me if this was somewhere else that I discussed it). With the infinite random sequence, an image (only) of God, these things are written an infinite number of times. Any finite part of it that is long enough, running on a computer, could always show our logic expressed as we know it. It could also always show the rules incorrectly expressed. That is because the predetermined meaning that could be anything intended, in the image, is not open to us and the XOR process shows that no specific random sequence matters. It's all in there somewhere and the computer can show anything you can imagine (now I will include moving images). It could show that the world runs exactly as our sight and sound senses tell us it runs except that if you walk 500 steps without stopping you step on the tines of a rake that suddenly appears and it pops up and gives you a good whack on the head and then disappears. Yet for some reason, people mentally (only) start to count their steps, they do not know why they are doing it, and they forget where they are in their count long before they reach 500. Then after 500 - whack!      Logic in this computable world would have to be different from the logic we love and know in order to account for these abnormal (in our world) mental phenomena. God knows this idea, but is not limited by it. If you don't like it, you can always ignore this computable meaning and only pay attention to the one you like. It's in there too but so are great numbers of other computable meanings.      Something that suggests this is the arrangement of the grains of sand on a beach washed by winds, waves, and disturbed by animals, including humans with their various activities, motorised or not, disturbed by their nuclear activity, etc. Now look at the arrangement of the grains as they change for a few days and then try to articulate something in the spirit of science as we know it that will allow you to accurately predict the arrangement of the grains into the future. I speak not here of the lack of sufficient information. I speak of the impossibility of knowing what agents with free will will do that will convert their mental phenomena into tangible acts.

"Bradley      I agree with Tomaszewki that you get the same modal collapse if God is non- simple.   The simplicity of God just makes this more obvious.   What I don't agree with is his ""solution"".   Here is why   ""Z1. God’s idea of zebras caused zebras to exist.   Z2. God’s idea of unicorns caused zebras to exist.   Here, (Z1) is true while (Z2) is obviously false, even though God’s idea of zebras is necessarily really identical to God’s idea of unicorns (and to the Divine essence)"".   The problem with this is the claim that God's 'distinct' ideas are logically posterior to God's cognition of Himself.   If God's idea of zebras is really identical to God's idea of unicorns there is no reason at all why the idea of a zebra would not cause a unicorn (or anything else). In order forGod to cause a zebra instead of a unicorn, God has to 'think' they are different. But a simple being's thought of a unicorn is identical to the thought of a zebra because there is no reason why a thought would differ from an idea.      The reason why thinking I saw Jack the Ripper caused me to run away does not entail that thinking Fracis Tumblety caused me to run away is because 'Jack the Ripper' and 'Francis Tumblety' are really distinct ideas for me. If I knew for certain that Francis and Jack were the same then thinking I saw Jack _would_ entail Z1.   Likewise, _thinking_ that zebras are not unicorns entails that the idea of a zebra cannot be identical to the idea of a unicorn.   Even if God's thinking or his ideas are logically posterior to God's cognition of Himself, those thought or ideas are still intrinsic to God and hence cannot differ across worlds.

"_Therefore if He be other than all things, as has been above shown, and through Him the works rather came to be, let not ‘by will’ be applied to Him, or He has similarly come to be as the things consist which through Him come to be. For Paul, whereas he was not before, became afterwards an Apostle ‘by the will of God;’ and our own calling, as itself once not being, but now taking place afterwards, is preceded by will, and, as Paul himself says again, has been made ‘according to the good pleasure of His will’ (Ephesians 1:5). And what Moses relates, ‘Let there be light,’ and ‘Let the earth appear,’ and ‘Let Us make man,’ is, I think, according to what has gone before, significant of the will of the Agent.

However, a human on this Earth can choose a lesser good instead of a greater good, (because we can consider in a limited way diverse _aspects_ of their good or lack of good) and this can represent _an evil choosing_. But this is, per se, a manner of being made in limited perfection, limited in part by the condition of not seeing the One Absolutely Complete Good directly and immediately. When we obtain that latter condition in the Beatific Vision, we will retain our free will but we _will not_ be able to choose badly: in that Vision we will see that no other good than God could _even seem_ to be preferable to God.

"@ Tadeo:      Sorry for the delay and thank you for your kind words! :) I have read the article. Some comments:      1\. You're right. Historical science is highly speculative. Lots of these ""theories"" are events which (purportedly) happened hundreds of millions of years ago and which have left a very weak trace. It's very difficult for us humans to do forensic science with things in the present and there's always room for (sometimes) grave mistakes. So reconstruing things that happened this long ago is an almost impossible task. Some evolutionary ""science"" consists for example in people who find a tooth and then make a ""reconstruction"" of the whole body plan of the animal, its environment and behavior. It's funny especially coming from the side of the ""we can only believe what our senses tell us"". It's an exercise in imagination most of the time. Our Saint knew a great deal about the power of human imagination and its inner workings.

"WCB      @Tom Cohoe      You post does not solve the theological fatalism dilemma. The claims of the Bible, God creates all and foreknows the future are supposedly revelations from God himself. Who authored the Bible according to Council Of Trent - Fourth Session and Verbum Dei - 1965. So Catholic Theology is stuck with these dogmatic assertions. And these assertions are plain enough they cannot be brushed off as allegorical, metaphorical, or anthropomorphisms etc.      So from here we can safely take this to its logical conclusion. All then from eternity is foreordained. God gets no choice in the initial state of creation that creates this Universe as it is actualized.

"Walter,      I don't think I understand your response. I did not mean to suggest that God could not have stopped the Fall (if ""the Fall"" happened; I was just using that as an example) with sheer power, but rather that a world like ours in which the Fall happened might be better than a world in which the Fall never happened. Or that, from the point of view of perfect rationality, one should not have attempted to prevent the Fall. It seems to me that there are many possible reasons, even beyond our ken, for why God could not have prevented the Fall without some immorality, or perhaps without sacrificing a greater good that could morally justify his inaction.      I do not deny that there is a plausibility to thinking that, prima facie, if God existed, the world should look a lot better than it is. Speaking for myself, I think it raises the probability of atheism to some degree, but I find it very hard to go beyond a prima facie impression here. It seems the problem of evil would require us to adopt a ""God's eye"" point of view that I don't think people can reliably have (I certainly can't have it, at the moment). I am not even sure enough about everything in morality. There are moral dillemas that I am unsure about, for example.      And while it strikes me as absolutely obvious that (e.g.) having an innocent person being tortured forever for no reason would be necessarily horrible, and the kind of thing that God/a perfect being could not do or be okay with, I am not at all sure about (and even see some plausibility in) theodicies where suffering builds a person's character (perhaps even in heaven, looking back?) and could contribute to a better end-state in the world and the victim will be in heaven in eternal happiness, etc.      I do not think that we can reliably have a ""God's eye"" point of view for the evils in the world to confidently say that a perfect being couldn't have permitted them, or that there could be no morally justifiable plan behind it, etc. I know that God (if God exists) could not be indifferent to them or not- intervening for no good reason. But I do not know enough to confidently say that there can be no reason for it all.

"It's very silly to say that ""logic wasn't perfected until the 20th Century"". For one thing, it's a very broad field. I assume you're talking about the Predicate Calculus (PC), but this system is far from perfect, and in many ways is inferior to the traditional logic even without taking into account modern extensions such as that invented by philosopher Fred Sommers, among others.      The PC isn't user friendly because it's so far removed from natural language. Maybe that explains why it's hardly used except by a few computer scientists doing formal methods; it's certainly not used by mathematicians. Most of modern logic's ""innovations"" are very minor and consist mainly of ""mathematization"". Symbolization has its uses in terms of pattern finding, but it's been heavily overdone. Aristotle made the major conceptual breakthrough. There was simply no ""formal"" logic before him. In fact, logic is mostly studied as ""subject"" in its own right these days, usually an advanced topic in math classes, not as a tool to be used for seeking truth and evaluating arguments.      It's usually asserted that the old logic is inferentially weaker than the PC, which is why the syllogism is usually relegated to short chapter (for historical interest) in the textbooks, if it's even mentioned at all. This is simply not the case - it's a massive con. Sure, the traditional syllogism IS limited, but the basic principle of syllogistic, the ""Dictum de omni et nullo"" (namely subsumption and substitution) can be applied to many different kinds of arguments, including those containing propositions having complex and relational terms. There is nothing that the PC can do that syllogistic can't. On the other hand, syllogistic can efficiently and easily evaluate arguments that the PC finds extremely cumbersome and unwieldy, such as numerical arguments.      The context and agenda for the PC was the foundation of mathematics, which was in disarray at the time. It may be a good tool for that specialized application because its character is ""ontologically explicit"" insofar as it states clearly whether a given entity does or does not exist, but for everyday reasoning and philosophy, not so much.",silly say logic perfected th century one thing broad field assume talking predicate calculus pc system far perfect many way inferior traditional logic even without taking account modern extension invented philosopher fred sommers among others pc user friendly far removed natural language maybe explains hardly used except computer scientist formal method certainly used mathematician modern innovation minor consist mainly mathematization symbolization us term pattern finding heavily overdone aristotle made major conceptual breakthrough simply formal logic fact logic mostly studied subject right day usually advanced topic math class tool used seeking truth evaluating argument usually asserted old logic inferentially weaker pc syllogism usually relegated short chapter historical interest textbook even mentioned simply case - massive con sure traditional syllogism limited basic principle syllogistic dictum de omni et nullo namely subsumption substitution applied many different kind argument including containing proposition complex relational term nothing pc syllogistic hand syllogistic efficiently easily evaluate argument pc find extremely cumbersome unwieldy numerical argument context agenda pc foundation mathematics disarray time may good tool specialized application character ontologically explicit insofar state clearly whether given entity exist everyday reasoning philosophy much,feser,2192,0,684

"Of course, the atheist will deny that the world has this character, and I’m not denying for a moment that showing that the atheist is wrong about that requires argumentation. The point is that the _kind_ of argumentation involved will not be a matter of forming empirical hypotheses and then testing them (using Mill’s Methods, or appealing to probability theory, or whatever). That’s just a category mistake. It is instead going to involve metaphysical reasoning that begins with much deeper facts about the world – for example, the fact that the things that make it up are compounds of essence and existence or of actuality and potentiality – and arguing that nothing that is like that could exist even for an instant without a sustaining cause that is not composite in such ways.

"Note that the implication of operationalism here is not just that we can _know_ someone is angry by way of observing his behavior. It is that there is _nothing more to_ anger than the behavior. Now, one problem with this claim is that it simply isn’t true. A person could be angry without exhibiting the usual behavioral signs of anger, and could also exhibit those signs without actually being angry. Hence anger is something more than the behavior. Another problem is that it turns out even apart from that to be impossible entirely to analyze anger or any other mental state in entirely behavioral terms. Suppose we say that “John is angry” means “John is disposed to raise his voice, frown, stomp his feet, etc.” The trouble is that this sentence will be true only if John does not desire to hide his feelings. But if we add a reference to the absence of this desire to our definition, we’ve now got a further mentalistic concept – desire – that needs to be given a behaviorist analysis. And it turns out that to carry out such an analysis, we need to make reference to yet _further_ mental states, with _those_ now needing a behaviorist analysis, and so on _ad infinitum_. Hence the operationalist analysis cannot actually be carried out.",note implication operationalism know someone angry way observing behavior nothing anger behavior one problem claim simply true person could angry without exhibiting usual behavioral sign anger could also exhibit sign without actually angry hence anger something behavior another problem turn even apart impossible entirely analyze anger mental state entirely behavioral term suppose say “ john angry ” mean “ john disposed raise voice frown stomp foot etc ” trouble sentence true john desire hide feeling add reference absence desire definition got mentalistic concept – desire – need given behaviorist analysis turn carry analysis need make reference yet mental state needing behaviorist analysis ad infinitum hence operationalist analysis can not actually carried,feser,1243,0,688

"Now, I am citing works in the Scholastic tradition to reflect the point of view from which I approach these matters, but on this particular issue I don’t think Wuellner’s and Carlson’s account differs in any relevant way from what your average non-Scholastic philosopher or scientist would say. The idea is, first, that a hypothesis is a tentative explanation of some empirical event that will occur _under certain conditions_. Hence, suppose some effect _E_ occurs under certain conditions of type _T_. We might hypothesize that a cause of type _C_ is responsible, and then go on to test this by bringing about an instance of _C_ under conditions of type _T_ and seeing whether an instance of _E_ follows. If it does not, we might form some new hypothesis, to the effect that it is another sort of cause (of type _D_ , say) that is responsible. But even if our prediction is confirmed, it is possible in principle that it is nevertheless not really _C_ that is producing _E_ , but some other causal factor that is merely correlated with _C_. So we’d need to do further testing to rule that possibility out. And in any event, if there really is some causal connection between _C_ and _E_ , only such empirical investigation is going to reveal it, because the causal relationship between them, even if real, is going to be _contingent_. Again, it will be _possible_ that something other than _C_ is the cause, so that the most that further testing can do is render this supposition _improbable_ (even if, perhaps, _highly_ improbable).",citing work scholastic tradition reflect point view approach matter particular issue think account differs relevant way average non-scholastic philosopher scientist would say idea first hypothesis tentative explanation empirical event occur certain condition hence suppose effect e occurs certain condition type might hypothesize cause type c responsible go test bringing instance c condition type seeing whether instance e follows might form new hypothesis effect another sort cause type say responsible even prediction confirmed possible principle nevertheless really c producing e causal factor merely correlated c need testing rule possibility event really causal connection c e empirical investigation going reveal causal relationship even real going contingent possible something c cause testing render supposition improbable even perhaps highly improbable,feser,1534,0,696

"@ Cantus, I'm the Anonymous who didn't post a screen name because I was having trouble with the comment screen, lol.      You wrote this: ""It's great that you've started to come to discard materialism, as it's a dead-end philosophy that cannot satisfy the human soul, no matter what anyone says.""      Rafael Nobre may well be on a better track if he adopts a position other than materialism. I think materialism has a problem in denying that abstract objects exist, for example.      But can you unpack what you have in mind when you speak as though a reason to discard materialism is that it ""cannot satisfy the human soul""?

"""How certain are you of that? If you are to any degree less than certain of that claim, then the door is open for as much religious certainty as a claimant says. If not, then I think you bear the burden to explain.""      Irreflectively, I think I am not 100% certain about that. But if I reflect enough on the matter, I think I might be able to reach 100% certainty - in that case, what could you respond?      Nevertheless, as of now, I admit that I am not 100% certain of it. So what? Although Cartesian doubt is possible for me on that point, it still strikes me as obvious that no one can have absolute certainty of their own religious tradition. It is crazy to think one can be as sure of ""Catholicism is true"" as one can be of ""2 + 2 = 4"". My lack of certainty about that is not a ""gotcha"". There is nothing inconsistent with holding (without absolute certainty) that there can be no absolute certainty about the truth of an entire religion.      (Notice, also, that I am not claiming there can be no absolute certainty of anything. As a matter of fact I am an infallibilist and I think we can know some things with perfect Cartesian certainty, and infallibly so. But the amount of things we can be truly certain of is very small. The first principles for example, like Non-Contradiction.)      So, so what if I am not absolutely certain? I still think it's crazy to suggest you can be absolutely certain that the Catholic Church is the one true church founded by Christ (who by the way was really raised from the dead, and by God, not by any other occurrence or being) etc. You are not certain of that. You might be VERY confident about it, for whatever reason, but you're not certain of it. And if you say you are, then I think you are confused.      ""A personal revelation is just that—personal. One would not expect others to have the same insight without a similar revelation. The fact that my certainty cannot convince you doesn’t mean that I am any less certain.""      Sure. I just think you are entirely confused - much like an atheist who says he is certain that the Christian God doesn't exist - and won't buy it. It's absurd to suggest a contingent fact (such as the truth of Catholicism, if it is true) dependent on so many other historically contingent facts, etc., could be the kind of thing a human being could be certain of. And if I had a ""personal revelation"" about it, I could still question whether I was hallucinating, jumping to conclusions, or whatever - even if I am nevertheless convinced of the revelation! - because it still wouldn't be anything like knowing that contradictions are impossible, that A = A or whatever.      It also doesn't reflect the reality of religious belief in life. Ordinary believers are not certain of what they believe - except if they say so in a vulgar and irreflective manner. They can be very strongly convinced and pious. But they also struggle with doubts from time to time, and are capable of wondering whether it really is true (even if they believe), and so on.

"Getting back to the comment actually made:      _For all that, it is still the Roman rite._      I may have to nitty-nit pick here: the antecedent of ""it"" is the Novus Ordo mass.      _Obviously the Novus Ordo is a departure... It was resisted, with good reason,..._      In the sense of your most recent comment: no, the Novus Ordo mass is not the Roman Rite, it is **one of the masses OF the Roman Rite.** It does not encompass and set forth the whole of and every particle of ""the Roman Rite"".      Speaking more generally: there is, so far as I have found in a reasonable amount of digging, no extant set of definitions that distinguish what, precisely, constitutes the _specific difference_ of a ""Rite"" versus other classes of liturgical distinction, such as various ""uses"" of masses. From my lack of locating any such definitions, or even anything that _purports_ to set forth the specific difference that sets the notion of ""Rites"" apart, I tentatively conclude that the historical practices that eventually came to represent the various ""Rites"" can only be distinguished as more or less _ad hoc_ collections of customs and practices, i.e. distinct by reason of historical accident rather than by reason of principled, per se differences. If so, there is nothing that necessarily prevents a _future_ practice in which the mass of the 1969 Roman Missal from being called a different ""Rite"" from the mass of the 1962 Roman Missal. If some future pope or council decided to distinguish them so, then they _would be_ distinct Rites for practical purposes, and that's (apparently) all that separates the other Rites in terms of being named so - practical purposes.

"Miguel writes: ""You haven't come up with any authoritative Church pronouncements in favour of a physical or 'dualist' God.""      To be clear: nowhere did I claim that there was such a pronouncement.      What I DO claim is that there is a radical disconnect between the God of the Bible (Whom the sacred authors clearly believed to be a corporeal being, as Professor Stavrakopoulou demonstrates in her book, even if these authors did not explicitly teach this) and the God of classical theism (Who was grafted onto the God of the Bible in the late second century by certain highfalutin Neo-Platonist Christians who feared that if they didn't drastically revamp God's attributes ASAP, the God of Judaism and Christianity would be exposed to ridicule by educated pagan philosophers). What I'm saying is that the pendulum swung too far in the opposite direction, and that the official pronouncements of the Church regarding God's attributes should be read in a way that makes them more compatible with popular piety and with the images we find in Scripture.      Remember: when it comes to interpreting Scripture, Catholics are Originalists (like some of the Supreme Court judges are with the American Constitution). The human author's original intent cannot be set aside willy-nilly. So, for instance, when Psalm 139:16 declares of God, ""Your eyes saw my unformed body,"" and Psalm 139:18 adds that God's thoughts ""outnumber the grains of sand,"" we need to respect Scripture, and acknowledge that God is indeed somehow made aware of events in the world (in other words, He has feelings and experiences), and that God also has multiple thoughts about us. At the same time, we need to respect the Church's insistence that God does not change (Lateran IV). For my part, I see no reason why God cannot be made aware of events in a timeless fashion, and why He cannot entertain thoughts timelessly.      Finally, re Augustine: let's not forget that he had a Christian mother: St. Monica. It is inconceivable that she did not teach her son the Christian faith, even if he chose to disbelieve it as a young man. Consequently, if Augustine was confused about God's corporeality, it's a fair bet that many Christians in the late fourth century were, too.      I shall lay down my pen here.

"As Kurt suggests: it may indeed be possible to ""read"" Francis's words in a charitable light in which ""what he meant"" was to castigate the nasty proselytism that uses bad means (and motives) to push people into the Church, and not to throw stones at the kinder, gentler persuasion by which we justly bring others to appreciate the true Church of Christ. But at the same time, Francis used highly ambiguous phrasings to convey that, and - like he has ever so many other times - he INTENDS to be ambiguous, that's is precisely his operating method.      In this case, for example, there is, in addition to the negative-connotation word ""proselytism"" in the second sentence, the word ""convince"" in the first sentence. There is no reason, outside of Francis's choice to put them next to each other, to imagine that ""convincing someone of your faith"" amounts to ""proselytism"". Even if one might have (before this) thought he was **strictly** avoiding the impermissible ""proselytism"" types of action, and merely speaking so as to ""convince"" a listener of his faith, now he has to second-guess whether even that is allowable. And so, Francis chose to cloud up the matter.      It would be silly to look at all the hundreds (at this point) of occasions in which he has done this, and somehow imagine that they come out evenly divided between a traditional and a progressive view of Christianity. They do nothing of the sort: the confusion and obscurity sown is **very decidedly** in favor of one angle, and that's the progressive view. He's never accidentally confusing in a way that promotes traditional, standard Catholicism. So, it's not accidental at all, it's intentional.      (And by the way, in that video by Mike Lofton is FAR from being wholly exculpatory: take, for example, this quote from a 2007 doc. by BXVI's curia:      _The term proselytism originated in the context of Judaism, in which the term proselyte referred to someone who, coming from the gentiles, had passed into the Chosen People….More recently, however, the term has taken on a negative connotation, to mean the promotion of a religion by ujsing means, and for motives, contrary to the spirit of the Gospel that is, which do not safeguard the freedom and dignity of the person. It is in this sense that the term proselytism is understood in the context of the ecumenical movement: cf. The Joint Working Group between the Catholic Church and the World Council of Churches…”_      Sure, the World Council of Churches take the term ""proselytism"" that way, **precisely because many of them think evangelization is a sin**. And so the push on the idea of ""proselytism"" = bad, and try to eliminate the meaning of the term which was just fine until they came along. Trying to control the language to win the debate. And shame on the Vatican for accepting their improper constraint on the term. If you want to shame those who proselytize wrongly, SAY that ""they proselytize wrongly"". Don't change the language just because it makes you uncomfortable.)

For another thing, Benedict thought the restrictions imposed on the celebration of the Latin Mass by Pope Francis’s _Traditionis Custodes_ were “a mistake” that “jeopardized the attempt at pacification” of traditionalists within the Church.

"Another point Aquinas makes (his third, actually, but I’ll treat them out of order) is that it is fitting that human beings be saved by faith in something past as well as by faith in something future. He does not elaborate, but I’d propose doing so as follows. Faith involves trusting the testimony of divine authority concerning matters that are usually not otherwise knowable to us. Now, sometimes things are not knowable to us because they are in the future, to which we have no access. But sometimes they are not knowable to us because they are past, and the past is also something to which we have no access, or at least no direct access. Hence, Aquinas seems to be saying, it is fitting that faith involves matters of the latter sort as well as the former sort. And the Incarnation’s being a past event (which it could not have been if it occurred at the end of the world) makes it possible for it to be among the things we know by faith in what God has done in the past. (For those who lived before the Incarnation, of course, it would have been something they would know by faith in what is future.)",another point aquinas make third actually treat order fitting human being saved faith something past well faith something future elaborate propose follows faith involves trusting testimony divine authority concerning matter usually otherwise knowable u sometimes thing knowable u future access sometimes knowable u past past also something access least direct access hence aquinas seems saying fitting faith involves matter latter sort well former sort past event could occurred end world make possible among thing know faith god done past lived incarnation course would something would know faith future,feser,1107,0,727

"The reason there is such a category as “heresy” in Christianity, whereas there is no such category in purely philosophical systems, is that Christianity claims to be grounded in special divine revelation.

He can try to show that his position is, when correctly understood, compatible with Christian revelation. But what he _cannot_ reasonably do is dismiss considerations of orthodoxy and heresy _tout court_. Again, by virtue of calling himself a Christian, he is committed to staying within the bounds of the revelation, and thus avoiding heresy.

"@ Walter Van den Acker,      An intelligible verbal communication can exist on a computer as a sequence of 1's and 0's that is made intelligible through an operational protocol that casts it to the monitor as readable words. No computer can print an infinite sequence to the screen, but a finite subsequence can be read through a computer this way. There is an absolute difference between an infinite sequence and a finite sequence here. Now no matter what the intelligible communication, it must exist throughout the infinite bitwise random sequence as a subsequence, normally distributed (from Wikipedia ""Normal Number"" on an infinite sequence of ""coin tosses"" : ""If a number is normal, no finite combination of digits of a given length occurs more frequently than any other combination of the same length"").      Yet in searching for the specific intelligible verbal subsequence described earlier it is impossible to know, if it is not found, that the infinite sequence is biased - is not normal, for the search could encompass a length of the infinite sequence that just does not contain the verbal subsequence. For example the sequence 01 should appear in 25% of the 2 bit subsequences, but if the sequence consisting of a million 1's in a row is where you happen to look for 01, you will not find 01 normally distributed in the million 1's. Such lengths missing the verbal subsequence must also appear in the infinite sequence, and they must also be normally distributed if the infinite sequence is normal, which it must be if it is bitwise 50/50 random.      This model of simplicity contains all human imaginable worlds that can be verbally communicated and yet no matter how much of it is human examined (i.e., the examination must be finite), a verbally communicable description of the finite world might never be found. You might just always be looking in the wrong place.      This is similarly true of human verbal speech about anything.      God knows this idea. It is a Divine Idea.

Prime matter is pure potentiality, always ""hungry"" to take on new forms. That's why our world is in constant change, but there are pockets of stability. Forms can ""rein in matter"" for some time, but not eternally. That's entropy, which has been empirically proved. And that's why ""evolution"" is a fact*.

And St. Thomas was the best among them.      If by ""proof"" you mean ""in a laboratory"", that can not be done, because our senses are adapted to our physical environment.

"Tomaszewski is a good writer, and he makes some good points in his paper. However, I think he unjustifiably dismisses hypothetical necessity, and that appears to undermine his possible worlds argument.      God is certainly identical with His acts, and in willing His goodness, He wills the world. Given that, said act of creating is necessary, but that doesn’t make creation absolutely necessary because the absolute necessity of God’s creative act is a condition upon which creation’s necessity _depends_. Thus, the ground for the universe’s necessity is extrinsic to the universe which makes it a conditional necessity.      Critics like Mullins argue that this undermines divine simplicity (DS) because it asserts two modalities (the act of willing and the act of creating), but there is no contradiction between the absolute necessity of God’s will and the conditional necessity God’s will produces. It’s a difference of cause and effect. Something absolutely necessary is necessary by its very concept whereas hypothetical necessity has an extrinsic ground. It is simply incorrect to assert the absolute necessity of the latter due to the absolute necessity of the former.",tomaszewski good writer make good point paper however think unjustifiably dismisses hypothetical necessity appears undermine possible world argument god certainly identical act willing goodness will world given said act creating necessary make creation absolutely necessary absolute necessity creative act condition upon necessity depends thus ground necessity extrinsic universe make conditional necessity critic like mullins argue undermines divine simplicity d asserts two modality act willing act creating contradiction absolute necessity conditional necessity produce difference cause effect something absolutely necessary necessary concept whereas hypothetical necessity extrinsic ground simply incorrect assert absolute necessity latter due absolute necessity former,feser,1178,0,744

"In support of your point, can we say that one essential factor differentiating magisterial and non-magisterial acts is the manifested will of a bishop to bind to obedience the faithful under his authority to adhere (at least in some degree) to a particular teaching?      Vatican II said of the Ordinary Magisterium, 'In matters of faith and morals, the bishops speak in the name of Christ and the faithful are to accept their teaching and adhere to it with a religious assent. This religious submission of mind and will must be shown in a special way to the authentic magisterium of the Roman Pontiff, even when he is not speaking ex cathedra; that is, it must be shown in such a way that his supreme magisterium is acknowledged with reverence, the judgments made by him are sincerely adhered to, according to his manifest mind and will. His mind and will in the matter may be known either from the character of the documents, from his frequent repetition of the same doctrine, or from his manner of speaking.' (Lumen Gentium 25)      As with Vatican I's dogma of papal infallibility, I would think that this is intended by Vatican II as a description to be also applied retrospectively, even if in the 7th century they were not yet thinking about it in these explicit terms.      The 'manifest mind' of a pope refers especially to the doctrinal content of a document; his 'manifest will' refers especially to his intention to teach and bind the faithful of the world. Normally he will not express this intention in so many words, but it can be known 'either from the character of the documents, from his frequent repetition of the same doctrine, or from his manner of speaking.'      But as a minimum, the intention to somehow bind the faithful of the world would require the intention to promulgate the teaching to the faithful of the world (not just sending a letter to one individual, leaving it to his choice and initiative to promulgate to the world as he saw fit).      The Holy See these days generally publishes a papal teaching document (including letters to individuals or groups) in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis if the pope's intention had been to promulgate that document to all the faithful - thus confirming that it has at least some level of magisterial authority.      Was it the intention of Pope Honorius that his letters to Patriarch Sergius be promulgated to the Catholic world as binding (albeit non-definitive) teaching? It does not appear so, and the condemnations of Honorius by the Ecumenical Councils do not require us to think this either.      Just as his letters do not fall within Vatican I's description of the papal Extraordinary Magisterium, neither, apparently, do they fall within Vatican II's description of the papal Ordinary Magisterium. And therefore, neither do they provide a precedent showing that a teaching of the papal Ordinary Magisterium can be not merely in error, but heretical.",support point say one essential factor differentiating magisterial non-magisterial act manifested bishop bind obedience faithful authority adhere least degree particular teaching vatican ii said ordinary magisterium matter faith moral bishop speak name christ faithful accept teaching adhere religious assent religious submission mind must shown special way authentic magisterium roman pontiff even speaking ex cathedra must shown way supreme magisterium acknowledged reverence judgment made sincerely adhered according manifest mind mind matter may known either character document frequent repetition doctrine manner speaking lumen gentium vatican dogma papal infallibility would think intended vatican ii description also applied retrospectively even th century yet thinking explicit term manifest pope refers especially doctrinal content document manifest refers especially intention teach bind faithful world normally express intention many word known either character document frequent repetition doctrine manner speaking minimum intention somehow bind faithful world would require intention promulgate teaching faithful world sending letter one individual leaving choice initiative promulgate world saw fit holy see day generally publishes papal teaching document including letter individual group acta apostolicae sedis intention promulgate document faithful - thus confirming least level magisterial authority intention pope honorius letter patriarch sergius promulgated catholic world binding albeit non-definitive teaching appear condemnation honorius ecumenical council require u think either letter fall within vatican description papal extraordinary magisterium neither apparently fall within vatican description papal ordinary magisterium therefore neither provide precedent showing teaching papal ordinary magisterium merely error heretical,feser,2927,0,749

""What matters is that there is a Will to do X. And a will to do X is not thé same as a Will to do not X.""      And the problem - to repeat myself again - is that if we are to maintain libertarian freedom, we have to have caused this Will. Otherwise the Will- for-X just emerges beyond our control and determines that we do X, and this is no libertarian freedom.      But if we cause the Will-to-X we cannot require a further, second order Will- to-will-to-X, otherwise we end up in a regress. That's been my point for a while now. So it turns out that this ""Will"" isn't really required for our choices. It's a confused notion that would lead to an infinite, vicious regress.      The existence of a Will-to-X becomes superfluous, since even on the assumption that it exists we must be able to choose and cause it (or the Will-to-not-X) without requiring a further second order Will. So it turns out this ""Will"" is not really required for free actions. In the end, LFW requires that an agent be able to choose and cause X or ~X without a difference in intrinsic properties. If there is a Will-to-X, it does not determine X, and is not incompatible with the possession of a Will-to-not-X.",may matter lfw came matter argument matter argument whether model count lfw depends course thing determinately lead vanilla rather chocolate must one cause otherwise control whatsoever action - emerges uncaused u hence beyond choice control cause action course matter argument since model unacceptable libertarian freedom proponent work defense claim lfw human already involves issue agent able cause distinct effect without change intrinsic property matter x x thé x problem - repeat - maintain libertarian freedom caused otherwise will- for-x emerges beyond control determines x libertarian freedom cause will-to-x can not require second order will- to-will-to-x otherwise end regress point turn really required choice confused notion would lead infinite vicious regress existence will-to-x becomes superfluous since even assumption exists must able choose cause will-to-not-x without requiring second order turn really required free action end lfw requires agent able choose cause x x without difference intrinsic property will-to-x determine x incompatible possession will-to-not-x,feser,2009,0,760

"Tom      If you say that the proposition ""God exists"" is a necessary truth you are applying a procedure that by your own admission you cannot apply.   So, that makes every attempt to use logic to argue for God completely futile.

Result: eternal happiness, while you, just before you die, after having lead an entire life as a devout Catholic, ""happen"" to become an atheist. back luck for you.      And that's why the Fall theodicy is so incredibly weak, and had better be named ""the Trap theodicy"", because it seems that God has waited just long enough for the first time Adam did something wrong to condemn him. Moreover, since he was the one who put the sequence there in the first place, He knew exactly what was going to happen and when it was going to happen.

"To be clear, I don’t doubt that the example works. It does, and it illustrates a genuine problem with the view that belief is (or is justified by) credence above a threshold. Specifically, this violates an apparently natural reflection principle, that if I rationally believe that I will rationally come to believe, then I should believe now. Issues like this seem unavoidable with a threshold (other than 1). The lottery paradox illustrates a different one: violation of logical closure. Of course, you may be prepared to live with such issues - maybe beliefs don’t have to be logically consistent.         My problem with the threshold approach is more basic. If I don’t have a credence, I can’t apply the threshold test. If I do have a credence, then noting whether it is above or below a threshold adds nothing useful. One response to this is straight Bayesianism, which rejects any role for belief (beyond credence 1). Another is that credence and belief are separate and related, but not straightforwardly. In the example, I would say that I _believe_ the relevant medical information about the chance that I have C and about the reliability of the test, and set my _credences_ accordingly.",clear doubt example work illustrates genuine problem view belief justified credence threshold specifically violates apparently natural reflection principle rationally believe rationally come believe believe issue like seem unavoidable threshold lottery paradox illustrates different one violation logical closure course may prepared live issue - maybe belief logically consistent problem threshold approach basic credence apply threshold test credence noting whether threshold add nothing useful one response straight bayesianism reject role belief beyond credence another credence belief separate related straightforwardly example would say believe relevant medical information chance c reliability test set credence accordingly,pruss,1196,1,766

The role itself that technological craft came to to have in the research is a consequence of philosophical positions (Bacon, Descartes, etc.), as you can see with the image universe-machine and God-clockmaker. It is a philosophical metaphor and the shift was prepared by an interation of philosophical speculations, socio-economical changes and processes that included the technological development, when the speculation integrated it in a theoretical vision (that, of course was fueled also by economic and military interests).      A telescope without Galilei platonic understanding of nature would have been useful only to see better the enemy deck during a naval fight.      All this said in a neutral way, just looking at the process and not judging it, because phenomenological understanding of a process is one thing, judgment of the phenomenon is another.

"@ Infinite_Growth,      ""speaking of free will, it disturbs me greatly that traditional Catholic theology has not considered animal abuse to be a deadly sin like Lust or Gluttony. That goes very contrary to religions like Judaism or Buddhism.""      First, note of pre-Christian Judaism that it certainly permitted the use of animals   for human needs, including for rites of sacrifice. Christianity does not include the use of animals for sacrifice so from your point of view that is an improvement.      Second, note that Jesus said:      ""Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."" (Matthew 5:17-20 KJV)      But much of what is specifically listed as law in pre-Christian Judaism is subsumed in Christianity as Love rather than being specifically listed, so while abuse of animals is not listed, it is an act of hatred against what God loves, which includes all of Creation. Now we have been given all of material Creation for our proper and needful use, but an act of hatred against anything is a turning from God and is a mortal or deadly sin as Christians always understood.      So at no time did Christianity embrace the evil treatment of animals. It would have always been recognized as hate. But as in many other things, a formal doctrine against the mistreatment of animals was later worked out from these foundational principles of Christianity. It certainly is explicit now. See, for example, the Catechism as promulgated by Pope John Paul II.      Buddhism is not a development of Christianity or Judaism. Therefore, its rites and rules, while based on partial truth, are not held wholly correct. We cannot properly be directed by Bhuddhist doctrine.

" _The question you seem to be asking is why God would not anihilate Satan. If that is correct, the question is non sense.

Although angels are ""immortal"" in the specific sense that they are not a union of form and matter and thus not capable of undergoing _death_ as the result of the separation of form and matter, they are not **necessary** beings like God is. They can ""not be"", both in the sense that God had to freely will them into existence in order for them to exist (and He might not have willed it), and also in the sense that God could freely choose to NOT CONTINUE to will their existence, in which case they would cease to be. Annihilation is not the same as death, just as creation is not the same as birth.      Angels are contingent beings, a nature with existence added thereto. God _can_ choose to will a being - including an angel - to cease to exist altogether, and if He did that being would not merely _die_ , but it would annihilated with no remaining parts to it.

"I posted the stuff above about GC. The standard view about elements in Aristotle is this:   "". For Aristotle an element of something is the most basic constituent of that thing. It is indivisible into   things that are different in form, which is to say that it cannot be analysed into further constituents - or 'elements' - of its own. The elements of bodies, then, are the simplest constituents of bodies (Metaph. V.3, 10l4a26-34, De cáelo III. 3, 302al4-21). ... Aristotle analyses fire, air, water, and earth into more fundamental constituents. Consequently the latter - usually believed to be the primary   'qualities', the contraries hot and cold, dry and wet, and often also 'prime   matter' - are more deserving of the name στοιχεία, or 'elements'. These items - the contraries alone, or together with prime matter - are considered the true elements of bodies because together they compose fire, air, water, and earth... in his view, fire, air, water, and earth are not elements strictly speaking, because they reveal under analysis further, more fundamental, that is, more elemental, items."" ~ Timothy J. Crowley, Phronesis 2008.      In the Meteorologica, Ari says that what we call fire is different from ""real fire,"" which is an excess of heat. The problem I'm puzzling over - and not just now, though Prof. Feser's review recalled it - is what happens when, say, a hot thing is destroyed. ""The hot"" in it doesn't just poof out of actuality and revert to prime matter. Something hot is left over and is a constituent of a new thing. So it's a puzzle, how ""the hot"" would NOT be a constituent of either the prior or the subsequent heated substance.      This question recurs when we substitute protons and neutrons or whatever for ""the hot/cold/wet/dry."" For Aristotle, ""an 'element', strictly speaking, is the primary material constituent into which bodies divide, or into which bodies can be analysed {Metaph. V.3, 10l4a31-34; De cáelo III.3, 302al4-19; cf.   Metaph. III.3, 998a22-b4; cf. Metaph. VII. 17, 104lb31: στοιχεῖον δ' εστίν εἰς ὃ διαιρεῖται ἐνυπάρχον ὡς ὕλη)"" ~ Crowley.      One may say, we never have ""the hot"" just by itself apart from substances that are hot. On the other hand, ""the hot"" bridges across corruption and generation, so it's hard to see how it exists only potentially apart from either substance. It does work during the bridge, so it seems to persist in act. Lindsay Judson said in a colloquium that what persists from corruption to generation is just the hot's ""extension.""

No, because we can understand Clement as meaning, not that God could do evil instead of good, but rather that he could refrain from acting at all rather than doing some good action.) Bradshaw also notes that Basil the Great rejects the idea that God creates “without choice, as the body is the cause of shadow and light the cause of brightness” (where he obviously takes these effects of the body and of light to be necessitated by them); and that Gregory of Nyssa holds that God created “ _not by any necessity_ … but because it was fitting.”",father also understand divine freedom way rule necessitated david bradshaw noteshttpsafkimelfileswordpresscomdivine-freedom-in-greek- fatherspdf clement alexandria say “ god good necessity choice ” conflict christian doctrine god can not positively evil understand clement meaning god could evil instead good rather could refrain acting rather good action bradshaw also note basil great reject idea god creates “ without choice body cause shadow light cause brightness ” obviously take effect body light necessitated gregory nyssa hold god created “ necessity … fitting ”,feser,934,0,810

"@ Vincent Torley,      Particles that are bound are in a different state than ""free floating"" particles. In a living body the state of these particles is a complicated superposition of orthoganal functions of position and time. The eigenfunctions of their states are similarly local and complicated since potentials themselves vary in a complicated way inside a living body, and they certainly change when the body no longer functions, as in death, when neurons, muscle cells, etc., are no longer transmitting and conducting action potentials. Whether a physicist does or does not believe that there is such a thing as death, i.e. whether or not anything changes is not relevant to the truth ( it is absurd to think that nothing changes). Hylemorphism is not inconsistent with radical state change of the wave function of the entire body with death.      Furthermore, the study of brain states with various types of probes disturbs the states and causes them to be different than they would be while private, according to quantum mechanics, so attempting to understand a free mind by probing brain states is bound to be beset with difficulties. Let's whack the golf ball off the tee and then study the tee to see what we can learn of the golf ball.      :-)      You seem to be involved in circular justification of your arbitrary prejudices here.

"""Suppose, for example, that someone said that he was contemplating Aquinas’s First Way or... I personally think both those arguments happen to be successful demonstrations of God’s existence.""      The First Way attempts to use scientifically testable observations as a basis for logical arguments for the existence of god.      The First Way is an argument from motion, which is offered in the general sense of change of heat in the example of heat-fire-wood. Motion is also used in its more common literal sense, as positional translation through space, in the example of hand-staff.      Thus, if one is using the First Way as an argument for the existence of god then the assertion of the existence of god is indeed a scientific hypothesis in that the examples of the First Way are scientifically falsifiable.      Science has already falsified the argument from motion, therefor the god hypothesis has been scientifically falsified, to the extent it depends upon the First Way, which has already been falsified.      The statement ""the staff moves only because it is put in motion by the hand"" is clearly false, as the staff will move ad infinitum (as Aristotle posited for motion in the void) absent an impeding medium. The fundamental error of Aristotle, Aquinas, Feser, and the majority of posters here is in failing to realize that space, for motion, is the functional equivalent of the void, and everything is in space, including the hand and the staff.      The false statement by Aquinas that ""the staff moves only because it is put in motion by the hand"" is based on the false notion that absent a continuous mover the staff will slow, and stop, and its motion will be lost, therefore, it was incorrectly thought, a mover is required to keep it moving.      In truth, all objects in the universe are part of a system of perpetual motion such that motion is never lost, only transferred and mutually perpetuated in some form.      ""arguing that nothing that is like that could exist even for an instant without a sustaining cause""   Feser has this back to front in a very strange inversion of logic.      If material exists at time1 and continues to exist at time2 that is no change in the existence of that material, therefore no changer is called for to account for no change.      If material exists at time1 and ceases to exist at time2 that is a change in the existence of that material, therefore a changer is called for to account for the change in the existence of that material.      Sustained existence = no change, therefore, no changer.   Unsustained existence = change, therefore, a changer.      Pretty simple.

Francisco J. Romero Carrasquillo put significant care into analysis and expression of the Five Ways of Aquinas in syllogistic form and symbolic format. The fact that the First Way is logically invalid as an argument for god is evidenced by the glaring omission of ""and this everyone understands to be God"" expressed in syllogistic form or symbolic format by Carrasquillo.

"I’ve mentioned already one of the implications I see in Cartwright’s discussion, viz. support for an epistemic structural realist interpretation of modern physics. Here’s another. It is a commonplace of modern philosophy of science that theory is _underdetermined_ by empirical evidence. What that means is that for any body of empirical evidence, there are always alternative possible theories that are incompatible with each other but consistent with that evidence. That does _not_ entail that all theories are equally good, but only that considerations independent of both theory and empirical evidence are ultimately necessary in order to choose between theories. Philosophers of science like Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend have also shown how extra- scientific considerations (of a philosophical sort, for example) play a crucial role in determining the outcome of scientific investigation.",ive mentioned already one implication see discussion viz support epistemic structural realist interpretation modern physic another commonplace modern philosophy science theory underdetermined empirical evidence mean body empirical evidence always alternative possible theory incompatible consistent evidence entail theory equally good consideration independent theory empirical evidence ultimately necessary order choose theory philosopher science like thomas kuhn paul feyerabend also shown extra- scientific consideration philosophical sort example play crucial role determining outcome scientific investigation,feser,896,0,831

"Tom,      Good luck trying to argue physics with someone who doesn't understand the definitions of terms.      I know you understand, but perhaps some readers don't.      Motion in physics is velocity. Velocity is a vector not a scalar so it is not just dx/dt but dx/dt with a direction. So when a thing changes direction or slows down motion/velocity is **not** conserved....by definition.      Momentum and energy have different definitions. The First Mover argument is about local motion/velocity, not momentum/energy.

"To add to Micheal's general comment with particulars:      _Paul was not able to receive salvation until he came to terms that he was in the habitual state of mortal sin of envy_      Paul, like everyone else, was not able to receive salvation without the grace won for us by Jesus Christ and his salvific sacrifice. True.      _and completely unable to repent_      Not properly put. All people, including Paul, were unable to repent without grace. With grace, all are able to repent. God has made grace available on account of Christ's redemption: to us who came after Christ, by believing in His work and receiving baptism; to those before Christ (like Abraham) by believing in the One to come and in his redemptive power to save, and obeying God.      _Fundamentally, every unregenerate person is habitually in mortal sin and cannot save himself:_      Nobody can save himself. All who, knowing that Christ is God the Redeemer become incarnate, refuse to receive the baptism He commanded by which we are regenerated, are unregenerate and have rejected the channel of grace which Christ ordained. All those who have received sanctifying grace through baptism, may be saved if they remain in that state of grace, or may be saved after falling again into sin by being repentant, and all should pray for the grace of final perseverance. None who are baptized are _excluded_ from that grace but by their own sins.      _G-d invented salvation for the benefit of people who are irrepentant and in habitual mortal sin._      God ""invented"" salvation for all, so that all might receive the gift of salvific grace. In doing so, they receive the possibility of breaking free from habitual sin.      _That is the only category of people salvation is of any use for._      Salvation only applies to the people who are, were, or would have been in sin, but for Christ's redemptive sacrifice. That's...all human beings.      _Any other category of person can be fixed by correction and deterrence, and does not need salvation._      That's Pelagianism, a heresy. Because of Adam's sin, all are (or would be) in sin, but for Christ's salvific act. In addition, even for Adam and Eve _before their sin_ , they were unable to be in the state of supernatural union with God but for the **gift** of grace, which enlightened them above the power of their natural faculties. None can be in the state of the blessed in heaven but for the gift of grace, none can attain it merely by their own unaided efforts, but all can attain it if they receive grace and persist in it.",add general comment particular paul able receive salvation came term habitual state mortal sin envy paul like everyone else able receive salvation without grace u jesus christ salvific sacrifice true completely unable repent properly put people including paul unable repent without grace grace able repent god made grace available account redemption u came christ believing work receiving baptism christ like abraham believing one come redemptive power save obeying god fundamentally every unregenerate person habitually mortal sin can not save nobody save knowing christ god redeemer become incarnate refuse receive baptism commanded regenerated unregenerate rejected channel grace christ ordained received sanctifying grace baptism may saved remain state grace may saved falling sin repentant pray grace final perseverance none baptized excluded grace sin g-d invented salvation benefit people irrepentant habitual mortal sin god invented salvation might receive gift salvific grace receive possibility breaking free habitual sin category people salvation use salvation applies people would sin redemptive sacrifice sall human being category person fixed correction deterrence need salvation pelagianism heresy sin would sin salvific act addition even adam eve sin unable state supernatural union god gift grace enlightened power natural faculty none state blessed heaven gift grace none attain merely unaided effort attain receive grace persist,feser,2553,0,846

"Norm, this is one of the most even-handed and sensible observations ever articulated on this site. It focuses on the shared responsibility of both Mums and Dads in the modern era to jointly raise their children to reach their maximal potential as fully participatory and contributing members in the community in which they live. There is no greater responsibility for which parents can be held to account.      Long gone are the days when the division of labour was defined on the basis of gender (Mum looks after the kids, Dad looks after the breadwinning). The reality is, our western economic system, founded as it is within the framework of a capitalist market has truly highlighted the fallacy of the traditional notion of family. Reality has shown it to be little more than a failed market system that is fundamentally family-averse, not only at the financial level, but equally at the personal, individual, societal and psychological level.      Good luck to women who can afford to stay home to look after the children. All kudos to them. They are the very lucky few. But the financial reality for the vast majority of families is a very, very different story and in many cases a harrowing one.      It should be remembered that the economy, economics, is first and foremost a study of human activity, human behaviour. And as is required in all societies, human behaviour must be moderated and guided through the law. Moderating human economic behaviour, in the same way we moderate human behaviour, be it through criminal and civil law, from its natural entropic tendency towards the worst excesses of economic activity, is the solution. As you say Norm:   ""The solution is to create conditions where both men and women can flourish in their roles as father and mother as well as in their professions.""

Often people don’t enjoy exercise, but they suffer it because the end result is good from the perspective of physical health. However we generally make the choice there, we understand how it helps our health. What about a young child forced not to ride it’s tricycle on a busy road, or to take some bad tasting medicine. In these cases most children don’t understand the end good. A few children may trust their parents, and so for them (and there parents!) it’s not really a problem. For others, the hurt and pain they feel at the unfairness of it all often causes them far more problems than the bad taste or the limited cycling options.      “That's like the fire brigade.

"I’m not sure when I first became aware of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who was later to become Pope Benedict XVI. During my high school years in the early 80s, I had only a vague awareness of the doctrinal controversies roiling the Church. I then knew little more than that they had something to do with liberal theologians and their opposition to Pope John Paul II. My first clear memory of Ratzinger himself is from the very end of that decade, when I had left the Church and was on my way to becoming an atheist. I read a magazine article about him and his work as the pope’s chief doctrinal officer. The impression it left me with was of a man of deep learning and gravitas. For some reason, what stood out especially was a remark of his quoted in the article, to the effect that a sound theology “cannot… act as if the history of thought only seriously began with Kant.” (I later learned that this came from a lecture of his since reprinted as the third chapter of _[God’s Word: Scripture – Tradition – Office](https://www.amazon.com/Gods-Word-Scripture- Tradition- Office/dp/1621643727/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1OBXNMW1E21RU&keywords=ratzinger+god%27s+word&qid=1672518516&sprefix=ratzinger+god%27s+wor%2Caps%2C396&sr=8-1)_.)",im sure first became aware cardinal joseph ratzinger later become pope benedict xvi high school year early vague awareness doctrinal controversy roiling church knew little something liberal theologian opposition pope john paul ii first clear memory ratzinger end decade left church way becoming atheist read magazine article work chief doctrinal officer impression left man deep learning gravitas reason stood especially remark quoted article effect sound theology “ can not … act history thought seriously began kant ” later learned came lecture since reprinted third chapter god word scripture – tradition – officehttpswwwamazoncomgods-word-scripture- tradition- officedprefsrcridobxnmwerukeywordsratzingergodswordqidsprefixratzingergodsworcapscsr-,feser,1219,0,862

And by underlining the dignity of human nature, the Incarnation prompts us to avoid sullying that nature with further sin.

"This is why Chapman draws the conclusion: “Unquestionably no Catholic has the right to deny that Honorius was a heretic… a heretic in words if not in intention” (p. 116), and why Butler cites this conclusion sympathetically. Some have tried to show how Honorius’s words can be read in an orthodox way, but as Chapman and Butler emphasize, this misses the point that the question of whether Honorius was a heretic cannot be settled by reference to his letters alone. The fact that _councils and later_ _popes themselves_ have denounced him as a heretic is also crucial, for to deny that he was a heretic is thereby to challenge the judgment of these councils and popes. To show that Honorius did not err, but at the cost of showing that these later popes and (papally approved) councils _did_ err, would be a Pyrrhic victory.",chapman draw conclusion “ unquestionably catholic right deny honorius heretic… heretic word intention ” p butler cite conclusion sympathetically tried show word read orthodox way chapman butler emphasize miss point question whether honorius heretic can not settled reference letter alone fact council later pope denounced heretic also crucial deny heretic thereby challenge judgment council pope show honorius err cost showing later pope papally approved council err would pyrrhic victory,feser,824,0,865
"@Michael @Talmid @AnonWCB      That was incredible, you are amazing guys. Thank you so much for the in-depth answers. That helped a lot.      I asked that because of the time I've been passing through life in the last 3 years. My life has been a lot miserably. So it's nice to know that - even though it's hard to imagine how in one act - God is listening to my prayers. But I won't lose my faith.      In case you guys were curious about that it has to do with things that happened before I meet Ed's blog. My life - my family - life has always been pretty harsh. And to worsen all that I have OCD. My grandmother on my father- side died of Alzheimer and I'm afraid that my father would develop that too. My mother lost her job due to an injustice that happened to her during the pandemic and all that bullshit.      But the worst thing that doesn't seem to go away is the depression and trauma that my OCD contributed to. I was very very influenced by Libet's ''experiment'' back then and unfortunately, I acknowledge a fella named Sam Harris with all that mysticism about 'no self' etc. (that seemed to follow from the experiment's conclusion), and since then that stuck in my head - not because I believed it - even though I had a weak spot for materialism and 'took it for granted' because you know ''science'' mentality that I was influenced to. The problem was (somehow still) the fact that I didn't even know how to defend myself from all that (i.e that the experiment methods were bogus, that the rest doesn't necessarily follow from it). And the implication with all of that in my life was the fact that if that is true, life is simply worse than it seems. There is just pain and suffering. What weighed more than one hundred pounds for me was the fact that I simply love my mom and my family and if there was no free will, no God, and we were somehow unreal because there was no self (nothing that lasts or abides)... I don't need to paint the rest of the picture to see how evil, atrocious, and how I felt and still feel because I have nightmares and traumas with that till nowadays.      In the midway path between that, I found Ed's blog and began to read it - even emailed him one time. And that gave me hope that there was a God after all and that those things could be false.      But even so, buddhist claims from Harris traumatized me a lot and due to my OCD, I still suffer from them till today. Deep there, I confess I'm really afraid that something evil like that is possibly true. Because it's an even worse version of materialism with all its adorns.      Based on what I've learned from Ed's books and posts I tried to read some authors from that and engaged against it for some time (authors like Jay Garfield and Mark Siderits)      (I will continue)",michael talmid anonwcb incredible amazing guy thank much in-depth answer helped lot asked time passing life last year life lot miserably nice know - even though hard imagine one act - god listening prayer lose faith case guy curious thing happened meet blog life - family - life always pretty harsh worsen ocd grandmother father- side died alzheimer afraid father would develop mother lost job due injustice happened pandemic bullshit worst thing seem go away depression trauma ocd contributed influenced experiment back unfortunately acknowledge fella named sam harris mysticism etc seemed follow conclusion since stuck head - believed - even though weak spot materialism took know science mentality influenced problem somehow still fact even know defend ie experiment method bogus rest necessarily follow implication life fact true life simply worse seems pain suffering weighed one hundred pound fact simply love mom family free god somehow unreal self nothing last abides need paint rest picture see evil atrocious felt still feel nightmare trauma till nowadays midway path found blog began read - even emailed one time gave hope god thing could false even buddhist claim harris traumatized lot due ocd still suffer till today deep confess really afraid something evil like possibly true even worse version materialism adorns based learned book post tried read author engaged time author like jay garfield mark siderits continue,feser,2777,0,866

"@ Laudator Temporis Acti,      ""He doesn't ""want"" 127 to be a prime and 128 to be a power of 2. They are those things per se.""      They are these things for either one of two reasons.      First, they are so because of a system of axioms with rules of inference that allows us to prove it as a conclusion of a formal argument. This method of proof is not necessarily connected with the world we measure and physically inhabit. For example, without the infinite parallel postulate the axioms can have added to them an intrinsic curvature in which by locally parallel transport a circle can be constructed whose area is a rational multiple of its radius and this circle can definitely be squared.      So much for ""per se"" or human fiat. I don't even have to invoke the God beyond human understanding to get that.      The second method is by measuring the physical world we inhabit and building up a finite mathematics which cannot be fudged up by arbitrarily adding axioms which have not been physically proven themselves.      Well it is just God's choice (will) that the local physics supports your system. We can examine what God *can* do by examining what a model of God allows, but we cannot examine what God *cannot* do this way because God is greater than a model of God (a picture of you can show your hair color but it can't jump or walk - but you can jump or walk and jump because you are not limited by what the picture cannot do) . If you conclude from a model that God cannot do something, you have only proved that it can't be done in the model - which is not God.      A good physical model of God is a computer with a program. A computer program exists in which any circle, measured in the program, is exactly 6 times its radius. This can be illustrated as a virtual reality in which virtual actors measure virtual circles and always get that result. It can be shown as a visual animation that can be watched, as in a computer game. This is a model of God. If it can be made logical (in the measuring sense, the second method of proof, in which axioms are experimentally determined as described above) on a computer, then God can make it logical in physical reality, which, of course, would be a different physical reality then the one we have come to know and love.      Similarly, God is not limited to creating a physical universe where 127 is prime and 128 is a power of 2. It just outrages your sense of mathematical truth as it is known to you from living in this universe, but emotion doesn't belong in mathematical proofs (in this universe).      It is just an old ""rule"" without ground that mathematics and logic are independent of God. It is just an assumption.      ""So who is right?""      That you cannot, in your mind, know who is right does not mean that there is no truth or that no one can enunciate it on a particular matter. That 15 people give different accounts of some event does not mean that none of the accounts are correct. If you drive from Topeka to Billings and two witnesses disagree on what you had for lunch, that does not mean that neither of them were correct. You had a tuna and marshmallow sandwich. One witness said you had a ham and cheese sandwich. The other said you had a tuna and marshmallow sandwich.      Is this inconceivable?

"@WCB      ""Consider this, Hiram. The village atheist has an IQ of 150. Danny the village idiot has an IQ of 50. How does concept of soul account for this?

Could it be we are all deficient as to our brains and withou that, we would all have IQs of 200?""      It will depend on the school, but most dualists i can think of can account for this.      Take for instance the more platonic/dharmic/spiritist view that the soul is a substance whose nature is other than the body and that not only has no necessary conection with it but is actually weakened by being stuck with it. This is pretty straightfoward here: the soul is stuck with the body limitations and so its natural capacities will be worser on a crappier body.      Take now the cartesian view were the soul is a substance whose nature is other than the body but is made to function with the body. Here the sould and the body must function together to it to work well, so a bad body will make the soul less capable of functioning.      Now take the thomistic view were the soul is the form of the body. Here things also work well, for the body is responsable for sense data, memory and imagination and the intellect(that the soul is responsable for) needs sense data everytime it needs to function*, so if the body do not work well, them the sould is screwed.      So it seems that the forms of dualism defended by philosophers, at least with a religious mindset, can work well on this case. The only type of dualism i can't see explaining it is the one you see on most fiction with superhumans or magic were someone can turn into a fly or a bird, say, and still think.

"Walter      “ No, suffering is not a necessary part of our creation unless your claim is that the fall was necessary.   The point of the Fall is that man and not God is responsible for the Fall, but nobody can be responsible for a necessary truth. that would be like saying you are responsible for why 1 + 1 = 2.”      Again, I think this is treating spiritual truth a bit like Newton’s laws of motion. The fall is a spiritual fall, it’s when spiritual death first appeared. Death can be seen as disintegration, but the modern, protestant, literalist mind always assumes this to be physical. Do you really think no creatures died before Adam and Eve ate the fruit?      Remember also that Lucifer fell from heaven before Adams fall. There is a far larger canvas here than just Adam and Eve eating something. Creating free, rational beings seems to inevitably result in at least some of them failing in terms if pride, and therefore obedience. If it’s not inevitable, it’s at least the case in Gods perfect plan for creation.      I do however also think that the fall was necessary at some point. We are each created unique. Some of us are like the prodigal son, and some more like his brother. There are lessons the Father wants both types to learn as part of the process of our creation that is this life. Without the ‘fall’ of the prodigal son, there is no opportunity for either brother to make the right choice to align with the father. Just as the creation of our bodies was via a process of ongoing refinement through suffering, our reconciliation with God is a partaking in the redemptive suffering of God as son of man. It’s of course true that man caused our fall. But God’s plan, from a perspective we can’t even imagine yet, is perfect. Nothing has gone wrong. Bizarre as that may seem to us at times in the middle of it, I believe this to be true.

"Now, _why_ exactly is this fitting? Yet earlier in the Question, in Article 1, Aquinas emphasizes that “the very nature of God is goodness… [and] it belongs to the essence of goodness to communicate itself to others.”  And out of his goodness, says Aquinas, God “did not despise the weakness of His own handiwork.” The idea seems to be that sin has exposed us to the weaknesses entailed by corporeality (from which we would have been protected had our first parents obeyed). To restore us to strength, God in his goodness imparts himself to us by becoming a member of the human race and thereby taking on corporeality.",exactly fitting yet earlier question article aquinas emphasizes “ the nature god goodness… belongs essence goodness communicate others ” goodness say aquinas god “ did despise weakness handiwork ” idea seems sin exposed u weakness entailed corporeality would protected first parent obeyed restore u strength god goodness imparts u becoming member human race thereby taking corporeality,feser,618,0,888

"David,      ""And it is absurd to bring to bear the (your) standards of human moral agency to attempt to critique what (little) you understand to be God's exercise of his moral agency.""      I think I can very much make a good analogy here. And my point is I believe I know some necessary moral facts which allow me to say what God can or cannot do (will or will not do). For instance, I am totally confident that it is impossible for God to create a universe consisting of nothing but children being burnt, tortured in horrible pain until they die and are annihilated - they don't even go to heaven eventually, nothing. I am confident that God cannot do that because it would be immoral.   So I can use my knowledge of morality to know what God can or cannot do. Of course, my knowledge will be limited and I could be mistaken about some things, but that goes for anything and it doesn't mean I can't draw rational conclusions here. And of some things I am very confident.      ""(what with ""ceteris paribus""* and all that -- wink wink) it's really not?""      The ceteris paribus clause is there just because I am open to human suffering possibly serving a greater good through e.g. soul-building theodicies, ""becoming stronger/virtuous through pain"", whatever. But the ceteris paribus version of the proposition is still true, and so human suffering is something that God should seek to alleviate/prevent, unless there is a stronger reason why he can't/shouldn't (and that is when we are led to theodicy).      ""But in any case, so what? What are you alleging against the Almighty here? That you're having trouble shaking the suspicion that you might have a better grasp of Necessary Moral Truths than he does?""      No? The point is that if God exists, he cannot fall short of the standards of necessary moral truths as I was talking about. (Indeed, for me he would be the Good itself, and the Good obviously cannot fall short of those moral facts; rather they are supposed to be reflections of the Good, which is only more reason to expect more of him than us, not less). And this sets up the problem of evil, because clearly the world is prima facie a pretty crappy place.      ""It's not that hard, actually. If God is indifferent to (e.g.) a child being tortured... (etc.)""      ""So again, back to the classic question: ""What if God was one of us,""      What if God is truly and perfectly good and wise.      ""But as you yourself say: ""In which case he would not be God, as God is supposed to be."" -- Right, but...""      Yeah, but the point is that the problem of evil is a challenge to God's existence. And it cannot be solved by holding that God, ""not a moral agent"", could really just be indifferent to horrible evils and do nothing about them, and so the existence of horrible evils ""could not possibly be incompatible with him"". This solution doesn't work unless one is okay with (absurdly) turning God into a seriously defective, irrational being, unworthy of worship (because this is what it would be entailed by it for most people, myself included). So the Davies line adds nothing to the problem; at the end of the day, we need the standard responses (skeptical theism, theodicies, etc.). Those responses come with an epistemic cost, but the theist must deal with that.

"Suck up all the words you want, when you can, while you can, Tom Cohoe. Because, as history is demonstrably informing us the hegemony of Catholic thought will continue to downsize in the public square due to its ever- decreasing significance and relevance in addressing the existential challenges in contemporary society. People are shedding the skin of catholic thought, not because it is wrong, but because it does not represent a comprehensive, let alone a universally acknowledged course in navigating the complex nature of modern life and its eclectic demands. It's a wishful throw-back to the 'good- old' days, to simpler times.      All of Feser's bogeymen, the most feared catholic demons are there: Marxism, postmodernism, liberation theology, and CRT. And Feser's manufactured rendition of CRT is intellectually and philosophically mistaken. Just as the extremely lucky that have had the good fortune of overcoming the psychological ravages and effects of Stockholm syndrome can attest, how easy it is for Catholics on this site to play the 'victimhood' card, that white people are being. ""... suckered into a spiral of endless self-abasement"". While-ever proponents such as Dr Feser deliberately choose to link Catholic thought as synonymous to the wholesale debasement of CRT going forward, my work is easy. I have no need to effect anything that isn't already the ineluctable result of the shrivelling of catholic thought. The seeds of its own destruction are deeply embedded within its own character.   It is egregiously misplaced for Dr Feser to argue from a perspective that is entirely unfounded. CRT does not, I repeat, does not teach that any race is inherently racist or superior, but it does teach how race is deeply ingrained in our history. The dozen or so States that have legislated against the 'teaching of CRT' in schools, banning books and curricular material across the country is the stuff of authoritarianism, not of democracies. It is nothing less than a cynical and forlorn attempt not only at erasing a somewhat sorry chapter in human relations but equally, the wholesale whitewashing of American history.

"@Phil Tanny, I can appreciate the desire to avoid getting mired in perpetual kvetching, but it is untrue that unless I can provide an alternative solution, I have no right to dismiss or reject an idea.      I also disagree with the problem statement and the premise that the solution involves some kind of massive payout by the so-called 1%. First, a wealth disparity between racial groups is not per se a problem to be solved. Second, if it is a problem, it isn't necessarily the result of any kind of racism in any tangible sense. It could be cultural, and I claim that the problem is largely cultural (for example, Thomas Sowell, for example, opines that the disintegration of the black family beginning in the 1960s, often assisted by well-meaning social programs, has had a devastating effect on black Americans; I would also mention ideologies of perpetual powerlessness and victimhood that both demoralize and divert energy away from constructive activity toward ineffectual grievance and blame). Third, even if it were racist, I don't see what the rich have to do with it unless you can show that they employ racist policies specifically to impoverish certain racial groups (the targeting of the rich under the pretext that they benefit from a rigged system is the kind of sloppy and unjust rationalization I would expect from a Marxist who foments class conflict). Fourth, throwing money at problems is precisely what (per Sowell) created much of the problems we're seeing today. NGOs, often run by wealthy philanthropists, offer a relevant example of how funneling money and free goods into causes can cause more damage than it solves (the destruction of the Nigerian cotton and textile industry through mitumba, the destruction of Haitian farming through free rice given long after a crisis has passed, even something like the effect of TOMS on African shoe manufacturing and repair). I'm not saying *charitable* work cannot help, but I would be very suspicious of any ""philanthropic"" or even government-mandated solution given their track record. More importantly, no amount of money can solve the basic problem which, again, is cultural. Maybe Catholic missionaries could play a role here. The Catholic Church is, after all, what turned even the pig-chasing savages of Europe into something resembling a civilization. Only after the Church has given structure to the mission to lift black America out of spiritual and moral decay and, secondarily, poverty, does talk of money make sense because only then can it be used and allocated prudently and with care.

"No, most certainly not. JPII, like his predecessors, acknowledges that God **calls** all to holiness, and even _orders_ them toward holiness so that holiness is their only true end.

(And all who receive sanctifying grace ARE in fact members of that Church, even if they are not expressly aware of it.) Thus the life of grace constitutes for EVERY man the wholeness and fullness of life, a sharer in Jesus Christ _in fact_ after being, from the moment of first conception, a sharer IN POTENTIA _by ordination toward_ that life, and by Christ's great mission to make disciples of all nations.

" **But the same sorts of thing occur in reverse,** when you judge and evil man to be innocent: in respect of the **mere judgment itself** neither harm nor benefit befalls anyone else, including him. But as soon as you act on the judgment by according him trust as if he were innocent, when he is guilty, you harm _whatever project hinged_ on according him that trust. This usually means harm to yourself (because, usually, you will be a participant in that project), or it COULD be many other people besides yourself. You therefore are **JUST AS LIKELY** to harm yourself and others in this way as in the first case above. The two are entirely analogous.      To look at it from a non-personal perspective: in a court of criminal law, regarding penalties that the law might impose, the judge (or jury) applies a standard of ""innocent until proven guilty"" and a standard of needing guilt to be established ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". But in a civil suit, the judge applies a DIFFERENT STANDARD: the award of damages or benefits is based on a mere _preponderance of the evidence""_ , i.e. wherever the stronger argument lies, there is where the judgment lies. And the judge MUST render a judgment that will be to the detriment (i.e. ""harm"") one of the two parties. Therefore, he must harm one and benefit the other on the basis of merely _whichever is one more probably in the right (has the better argument)_ , he cannot choose to opt out of judging.      Here's the thing: The ""court of public opinion"" and personal judgments are similar to each other in this - that they are RIGHTLY not restricted to bringing conclusions only with evidence showing ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". They both RIGHTLY make judgments based (at least much closer to) on a mere _preponderance of the evidence_ , OR EVEN LESS! And this applies to the vast, vast array of social and civic decisions we must make: I choose not to enter into a repair contract with this roofing contractor because ""he felt slimy to me"", and nothing more specific than that, is a **perfectly appropriate** judgment to make. I don't even have to be judging him to be ""slimy"" as being ""more likely than not"" (i.e. above 50%), it would be sufficient for me to do it based on a lower scale, like 20% or 30% likelihood, because I can go find another contractor whom I estimate is far less likely to be slimy, perhaps ""less than 5%"". Thus I ""harm"" the first contractor based on a very modest basis of evidence, and do so with complete legitimacy.      You might recast this judgment as being not ""he IS slimy"" but rather ""there is a 30% probability he is slimy"", but that doesn't prevent (a) that you made a negative judgment and a negative CHOICE affecting him, and (b) your choice does him harm (in some sense). So recasting it that way still causes the judgment to fall under St. Thomas's stated opprobrium, even though it is manifestly a right kind of judging.      The only way to repair the argument Thomas gives is to reframe it as: it is wrong to make FIRMER judgments (against) someone than the evidence (you have) allows for. And the certain wrongness here lies **primarily in its defiance to the virtues of truth** , and not ""harm to the person.” The virtues of truth (e.g. prudence) would have you make DUE judgments that the evidence allows for, and WITHHOLD from firmer opinions than the evidence allows, and when you violate that, you _harm yourself_ first, before harming some other. Due judgments may well rely on less-than-solid evidence, if they are less-than- solid _judgments_ (i.e. when they are held as opinions). Withholding from making judgments on incomplete evidence is ALSO a failure of prudence, when a judgment is needed regardless of the state of the evidence. Commanders in battle must often make judgments of the enemies tactical object when the evidence is far from solid, they cannot just wait until they have proof or even something close to it.",sort thing occur reverse judge evil man innocent respect mere judgment neither harm benefit befalls anyone else including soon act judgment according trust innocent guilty harm whatever project hinged according trust usually mean harm usually participant project could many people besides therefore likely harm others way first case two entirely analogous look non-personal perspective court criminal law regarding penalty law might impose judge jury applies standard innocent proven guilty standard needing guilt established beyond reasonable doubt civil suit judge applies different standard award damage benefit based mere preponderance evidence ie wherever stronger argument lie judgment lie judge must render judgment detriment ie harm one two party therefore must harm one benefit basis merely whichever one probably right better argument can not choose opt judging thing court public opinion personal judgment similar - rightly restricted bringing conclusion evidence showing beyond reasonable doubt rightly make judgment based least much closer mere preponderance evidence even le applies vast vast array social civic decision must make choose enter repair contract roofing contractor felt slimy nothing specific perfectly appropriate judgment make even judging slimy likely ie would sufficient based lower scale like likelihood go find another contractor estimate far le likely slimy perhaps le thus harm first contractor based modest basis evidence complete legitimacy might recast judgment slimy rather probability slimy prevent made negative judgment negative choice affecting b choice harm sense recasting way still cause judgment fall st stated opprobrium even though manifestly right kind judging way repair argument thomas give reframe wrong make firmer judgment someone evidence allows certain wrongness lie primarily defiance virtue truth harm person ” virtue truth eg prudence would make due judgment evidence allows withhold firmer opinion evidence allows violate harm first harming due judgment may well rely less-than-solid evidence less-than- solid judgment ie held opinion withholding making judgment incomplete evidence also failure prudence judgment needed regardless state evidence commander battle must often make judgment enemy tactical object evidence far solid can not wait proof even something close,feser,3929,0,911

"While I hold a lot of skepticism about McGinn's use of mysterianism on the hard problem of conscious thought, as a Cathlolic I also would tend to be very, very cautious about castigating mysterianism _altogether_. After all, we Catholics are in the position of positing that without the grace of faith, we **could not know** that God is a trinity of persons, and further that we cannot really _understand_ (fully) the Trinity in our present state (behind the veil, through a glass darkly).      Suffice it to say: we cannot invoke mysterianism _merely_ because it is a hard problem. There must be a properly accounted reason that _explains_ our inability to access the thoughts needed. In the case of God, we are limited intelligences, and he is unlimited intelligence, and so our minds are not of a nature capable (on their own) of encompassing the whole of God. But that account doesn't work for our own minds: presumably, the nature and workings of our minds are correlative to _our minds_.      However, it may be possible to argue that we cannot _in principle_ access the way our minds work **directly** , because when we are thinking an immaterial thought (say, about pi), we cannot ALSO be thinking second-layer thinking _about_ that thought, (at least, without the danger of disturbing and ending the thought about pi in order to think the thought ABOUT the thought about pi. So, (arguably) we could only ever, at best, draw the conclusions about consciousness in terms of _indirect_ considerations, rather than via direct access / observation. That doesn't (quite) get you to the mysterian ""we can't know"", but it may _limit_ what can be said with certainty.",hold lot skepticism use mysterianism hard problem conscious thought cathlolic also would tend cautious castigating mysterianism altogether catholic position positing without grace faith could know god trinity person can not really understand fully trinity present state behind veil glass darkly suffice say can not invoke mysterianism merely hard problem must properly accounted reason explains inability access thought needed case god limited intelligence unlimited intelligence mind nature capable encompassing whole god account work mind presumably nature working mind correlative mind however may possible argue can not principle access way mind work directly thinking immaterial thought say pi can not also thinking second-layer thinking thought least without danger disturbing ending thought pi order think thought thought pi arguably could ever best draw conclusion consciousness term indirect consideration rather via direct access observation quite get mysterian know may limit said certainty,feser,1667,0,915

"I agree with Walter that the ""God is good only in an analogical sense, not a univocal one!"" is a horrible and useless defense. As he said, when there is an analogy there is something in common; in particular, in ""God is good"" there is an analogy of proper proportionality. It is not a metaphor. For the classical theist, God is the source of all actualities - and that includes virtues and moral agency -, and as the source of all perfection and pure act God must FORMALLY possess all pure perfections (that is, perfections that in themselves include no limitation), but in an eminent way. The formal possession of pure perfections by God is insisted upon by many thomists (e.g. Garrigou-Lagrange) and is compatible with analogy (again, it's an analogy of proper proportionality).      Therefore, one can only say that ""God is not a moral agent"" or ""God is not virtuous"" if one believes that moral agency and virtue are not pure perfections. But I think it's obvious that they are pure perfections; the fact that moral agency is found in us in a limited, creaturely manner doesn't make it any less of a perfection just like the fact that wisdom is found in us in a changing, limited, creaturely manner doesn't mean wisdom is not a perfection - and the theist certainly says God is wise in a literal way. God is therefore also properly said to be morally good - indeed, morally perfect - and this goodness cannot contradict what seems basic to us with regard to evil, moral value, etc. Just like we wouldn't say God is omniscient if he didn't literally know (e.g.) that we exist. This is also why I think the ""Brian Davies"" line of approaching the PoE is entirely useless. And it has nothing to do with classical theism per se, but rather with moral virtue being or not being a pure perfection. Needless to say, most people would agree that if God does not at all care to stop a child from being tortured, then God is seriously deficient (which should be impossible).      Walter,      That being said, I wonder how you can feel so confident about the presence of suffering on this earth being totally pointless, and that it would be better to have a world (e.g.) without any Fall at any point. Don't you think that lies beyond your cognitive capacities? At the very least, doesn't it give you pause? It is very clear to me that, for instance, a world consisting of nothing but innocent people being tortured without end is a horrible world and God could not make it. But while that is clear, it is not at all clear to me that it would be immoral to have a world in which people suffered for some finite time on earth, and then went on to enjoy a much longer happy afterlife. And it is far from clear to me that the finite sufferings experienced in that world could not end up contributing to making the good end-state better, or just allowing for a good amount of soul-building, etc. I think you should give more credit to skeptical theism.      Don't get me wrong, I do see the strength in the problem of evil. But it seems to me that you are a bit too confident in the idea that there could be no morally sufficient reasons for God to create a world like ours; especially given that we might only know such a small part of life and the world (it could be like judging a whole novel on the basis of the first pages).",agree walter god good analogical sense univocal one horrible useless defense said analogy something common particular god good analogy proper proportionality metaphor classical theist god source actuality - includes virtue moral agency - source perfection pure act god must formally posse pure perfection perfection include limitation eminent way formal possession pure perfection god insisted upon many thomists eg garrigou-lagrange compatible analogy analogy proper proportionality therefore one say god moral agent god virtuous one belief moral agency virtue pure perfection think obvious pure perfection fact moral agency found u limited creaturely manner make le perfection like fact wisdom found u changing limited creaturely manner mean wisdom perfection - theist certainly say god wise literal way god therefore also properly said morally good - indeed morally perfect - goodness can not contradict seems basic u regard evil moral value etc like say god omniscient literally know eg exist also think brian davy line approaching poe entirely useless nothing classical theism per se rather moral virtue pure perfection needle say people would agree god care stop child tortured god seriously deficient impossible walter said wonder feel confident presence suffering earth totally pointless would better world eg without fall point think lie beyond cognitive capacity least give pause clear instance world consisting nothing innocent people tortured without end horrible world god could make clear clear would immoral world people suffered finite time earth went enjoy much longer happy afterlife far clear finite suffering experienced world could end contributing making good end-state better allowing good amount soul-building etc think give credit skeptical theism get wrong see strength problem evil seems bit confident idea could morally sufficient reason god create world like especially given might know small part life world could like judging whole novel basis first page,feser,3317,0,917

"All the same, in the context of contemporary mass media, the more common sin by far is that of rash judgment. Indeed, social media exchanges and political discourse sometimes seem to consist in little more than rash judgment as Aquinas characterizes it – that is, judgment about “the inward intention, or other uncertain things” about another person, which “proceeds not from benevolence but from bitterness of heart.” Opponents are routinely demonized, condemned as wicked rather than merely wrong.

Policy differences are attributed, not to sincere but mistaken opinions about what is best for the country, but to cynical political calculation.

"If we think that it’s never rational for a rational agent to refuse free information, then the above argument can be made rigorous to establish that any discontinuous rise in the epistemic value of credence at the point at which knowledge of a truth is reached is exactly mirrored by a discontinuous fall in the epistemic value of a state of credence where seeming-knowledge of a falsehood is reached. Moreover, the rise and the fall must be in the ratio 1 − _r_ : _r_ where _r_ is the knowledge threshold.

"As far as I know, Michael Jones has never mentioned A-T metaphysics on his channel. He puts out some really good content and he's a smart guy, but imo he's overly deferential to ""modern consensus"" in a lot of matters and has most likely written it off without consideration as ""that outdated stuff that everyone knows was debunked by Francis Bacon or whoever"" like most moderns.      Regarding his idealism, I would say that's probably the second best interpretation of quantum mechanics out there.      Let's say you've never really given A-T metaphysics much thought, and just generally take for granted the moderns' assumption that smaller things are more fundamental and that bigger things are aggregates of them rather than being substances with irreducible powers of their own.      If you're a typical Reddit-tier intellectual lightweight atheist, you're liable to take the mere existence of increasingly small particles, and their lack of the properties that humans, animals, and objects of every day experience possess, as ""proof"" of eliminativism regarding those properties. See above in the comments to this very post for examples of that line of thinking.      If you're a more thoughtful guy like Jones, you'll likely note that eliminativism is incoherent and invalidates all of our observations and all of our reasoning, and therefore cannot be true.

"Trouble is, we do _not_ ‘accept that the cat’s life is causally connected to the particle’s superimposed state’. At any given moment the cat, which is not in any meaningful way a quantum phenomenon, is either alive or dead. If we don’t observe the Geiger counter and don’t look in the box, we don’t know which it is – but that is true of _any_ experiment where we don’t observe the outcome, and has nothing to do with quantum mechanics.      Which brings us back to this: The actual ‘observer’ of the quantum event is the Geiger counter, and whatever Rube Goldberg contraption you rig up to be activated by that observation is not relevant to quantum theory. I reiterate that human beings do not themselves observe quantum events; they only observe instruments which are designed to detect such events. The events are known to occur whether an instrument measures them or not. Nuclear fusion, for instance, consists of an enormous number of quantum events taking place (typically) in the core of a star. No human or manmade instrument has ever directly observed such an event, but we know, by the fact that stars shine and exhibit the properties observed by astronomers, that the events are taking place. And they are taking place in our absence. If you look at a remote galaxy, you are seeing light generated by quantum events that occurred long before there was any human being to see them. And you would be very silly indeed to suppose that those galaxies exist only because a human astronomer came along and pointed his telescope at them to cause the waveforms to collapse.",trouble ‘ accept life causally connected superimposed given moment cat meaningful way quantum phenomenon either alive dead observe geiger counter look box know – true experiment observe outcome nothing quantum mechanic brings u back actual ‘ observer quantum event geiger counter whatever rube goldberg contraption rig activated observation relevant quantum theory reiterate human being observe quantum event observe instrument designed detect event event known occur whether instrument measure nuclear fusion instance consists enormous number quantum event taking place typically core star human manmade instrument ever directly observed event know fact star shine exhibit property observed astronomer event taking place taking place absence look remote galaxy seeing light generated quantum event occurred long human see would silly indeed suppose galaxy exist human astronomer came along pointed telescope cause waveform collapse,feser,1577,0,940
"The Heisenberg uncertainty principle teaches that it is not possible to know with certainty the position and momentum of a physical particle. The key here is that this uncertainty is accepted as certain, and the discussion ends for all practical effects in that it does not impose any particular difficulties in the interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, as far as I understand.      Maybe by way of a metaphor we can transpose the same principle to metaphysical and theological matters, namely the existence of soul, self and, ultimately, G-d.      There is no dispute that physical particles are endowed with position and momentum. It happens that we cannot measure them. It's not because we cannot measure them that they don't exist. Why can't we transpose these thoughts into the metaphysics of the Soul, the Self and G-d. They exist, we simply do not ""have the tools"" (aka Faith).      ... or so it seems to me ... juat a random thought.

"@wcb Science, by its very nature, is concerned with understanding the underlying principles of the natural world. This requires a belief in the existence of an objective reality that is separate from our subjective perceptions. Without this belief, it would be impossible to develop the scientific method, which is based on the idea that the natural world is knowable and that knowledge can be acquired through observation and experimentation.      You also need some kind of framework for understanding the relationship between the natural world and our concepts of it. How is the natural world knowable? Materialism has cut off the abstraction of quantities from what is abstracted and how it’s abstracted, and then ignored this as if it’s irrelevant magic that just happens in the background. Yes this process is very effective at developing theories of what is presented to us as reality. However to then claim that the quantitive abstraction IS reality is like looking at a great painting under the microscope, and claiming that the painting is nothing more than pigment on canvas fibres. It’s only correct if you restrict reality in a very warped way.

"""Belief"" is a human act of assent to a proposition that has a funny character: First, it isn't _belief_ if the truth of the proposition and the basis for it is **manifest** , e.g. by a mathematical proof - for then the assent would be the assent of ""knowledge"" and not belief. At the same time, order for it to be ""belief"" proper and not ""opinion"", (both of which are kinds of assent to something _not known_ ), the assent of belief exceeds the incomplete direct evidence for its truth, whereas with an opinion the assent is itself _partial_ , i.e. a reserved assent, because the mind allows for the possibility that more evidence might lead against the proposition. Belief is a sort of assent that isn't constrained by that lack of sufficient evidence for proof.      On the one hand, it is true that a person doesn't ""choose"" what they believe - at least _in a sense_ : people aren't able to turn on or turn off a belief like they can turn on or off their various actions. It's more like preferences: you can't just decide to believe some proposition X because you would like to, today, just as you can't _just decide_ to like tomato soup today where yesterday you despised it.      Yet beliefs ARE susceptible to our choices in other senses: for example, a person can avoid a belief by _choosing_ to refuse to think about the matter and refusing to weigh even the incomplete evidence in its favor. Many people avoid considering a possible life-after-death in a serious way, for a number of reasons, and by avoiding _thinking about it_ , they avoid what might have led to their believing in it.      Also, the assent of faith, while it by is something moving you via grace to assent, is not normally moving you _irresistably_ so that you perforce MUST assent. It is quite other: the movement of grace _can_ be resisted, and a person can thus WILL to _not believe_ who in all other respects had everything ready and available by which to believe.",belief human act assent proposition funny character first belief truth proposition basis manifest eg mathematical proof - assent would assent knowledge belief time order belief proper opinion kind assent something known assent belief exceeds incomplete direct evidence truth whereas opinion assent partial ie reserved assent mind allows possibility evidence might lead proposition belief sort assent constrained lack sufficient evidence proof one hand true person choose believe - least sense people able turn turn belief like turn various action like preference decide believe proposition x would like today decide like tomato soup today yesterday despised yet belief susceptible choice sens example person avoid belief choosing refuse think matter refusing weigh even incomplete evidence favor many people avoid considering possible life-after-death serious way number reason avoiding thinking avoid might led believing also assent faith something moving via grace assent normally moving irresistably perforce must assent quite movement grace resisted person thus believe respect everything ready available believe,feser,1947,0,944

"(I will continue)      And to be fair, this all has to do with the doctrine of momentariness (and once again, read the chapter 4 from the Siderits book I've just mentioned or the Jay Garfield one, which has a chapter just for that).      But it's important though that for buddhists things have no motion since motion would imply substances or something that survives. And that's where I collapse because I'm not so good in A-T meta to explain all the problems with the argument that Siderits sets out in the book. Unfortunately - but sincerely - I can only feel that something is very wrong (and I'm not proud of not pointing out what is it). But I can at least think that is by making seriously controversial claims like ""things produce their effects and them go out of existence"" that the argument supposedly has some weight. But even if that's so, it's not clear that that could not be interpreted as an ephemeral substance (the ones that Ed exemplifies when talking about when explaining prime matter in Scholastic's Meta) for example.      But one thing that puzzles me a lot about buddhism - without even mentioning their purported attempt to show that they are ""not eliminativists"" about persons, but that persons just are ""useful fictions"". Is how they square to the fact from impermanence of all phenomena with things like semantics, language, or words. After all, they wrote a book arguing that people do not exist (or exist just conventionally because nothing lasts for more than a moment) exactly in a language that exist (with modifications, of course) since the 5th century i.e English. And that's what makes me puto ('pissed') with it because the evidence against their position it seems to be everywhere but they never want to look at it. And to say that since all phenomena are impermanent, so language and semantics are just conventionally true but not ultimately true just raises the question of how it is even possible in principle for something that is impermanent and shouldn't last for more than a moment gives the impression of permanence in the first place? To put it simply how could impermanent and momentary things could even in principle brought up the illusion of permanence if they are impermanent? Because if they want to salvage their position they would necessarily argue that the idea of permanence in the conscience, memory, and objects from everyday life are just illusions.

"""and neither are any of God's perfections and human perfections.""      I disagree with that and you seem to be missing the point of analogy. Of course God is not perfectED but he nevertheless is *literally* perfect in the sense that he eminently possesses (eternally) all of the actualities that creatures come to possess when they are perfected. As I said, it has long been a standard thomistic view to say that God must *formally* possess all pure perfections. This is related to what names we can literally predicate of God with analogy. We don't say that God is wise just because God caused wisdom, just like we don't say God is a cat (though he is the cause of cats and hence has all of their actualities). Wisdom per se does not entail limitations, but on the contrary, an increase in being.      If you want to insist that this is no analogy of proper proportionality etc. and discuss terminology, nevertheless the metaphysical point remains that God must possess all of the actualities/perfections of its creatures (see ST I question 4 for instance), and hence be relevantly like a moral agent unless you think moral agency is intrinsically limiting.      Again, would you say that God is not intelligent? That God is not wise? That God is not free? Just because a perfection is found in a limited and creaturely manner in us, that does not mean it is not a pure perfection per se. The same goes for ""God is a moral agent"".      ""while the notion of moral is also rooted in the notion of custom (or more), which in turn is intrinsically (both conceptually and existentially) dependent upon a framework of human practices and institutions and corresponding ends and modes of excellence""      I completely disagree. To me, moral has to do with the necessary facts of ethics. ""Moral agency"" simply refers to the capacity of beings possessed with intellect and will (and hence freedom) to act in accordance with (or contrary to) the necessary moral facts (such as ""torturing people is wrong/evil""). God absolutely is a moral agent. Again, this has nothing to do with classical theism but rather with whether ""moral agent"" is a pure perfection or not.      And the point remains that when we attribute goodness, and moral goodness, to God (and we do; and in particular, Christian believers must do that) there must be some basic standards which God must fulfill, lest the attribution of goodness becomes equivocal. It would not do to say ""God is most wise!! Omniscient and perfectly knowing!"" and yet have God not actually knowing whether we exist or not. But if God does not care about the suffering of people (to the point where we could prima facie expect him to prevent or stop it) then this God is not ""good"". He might be ""good"" the way a squirrel that has all of its bodily parts is ""good"", but not good in the relevant sense that believers profess him to be - and would, again, strike many of us as a severely defective being (which should be impossible for the Purely Actual source of all existence and perfection). This is all that is needed to get the problem of evil going, however.      It amazes me how some people don't realize that the ""God is not a moral agent"" line not only is metaphysically problematic for many (again, it has to do with moral agency being a pure perfection or not, not with classical theism per se. There are also classical theists that deny there is knowledge in God, after all) but also only ""solves"" the problem of evil at the expense of making God unworthy of love and worship to most believers, as well as a severely defective and limited being to many metaphysicians.",neither perfection human perfection disagree seem missing point analogy course god perfected nevertheless literally perfect sense eminently posse eternally actuality creature come posse perfected said long standard thomistic view say god must formally posse pure perfection related name literally predicate god analogy say god wise god caused wisdom like say god cat though cause cat hence actuality wisdom per se entail limitation contrary increase want insist analogy proper proportionality etc discus terminology nevertheless metaphysical point remains god must posse actualitiesperfections creature see st question instance hence relevantly like moral agent unless think moral agency intrinsically limiting would say god intelligent god wise god free perfection found limited creaturely manner u mean pure perfection per se go god moral agent notion moral also rooted notion custom turn intrinsically conceptually existentially dependent upon framework human practice institution corresponding end mode excellence completely disagree moral necessary fact ethic moral agency simply refers capacity being possessed intellect hence freedom act accordance contrary necessary moral fact torturing people wrongevil god absolutely moral agent nothing classical theism rather whether moral agent pure perfection point remains attribute goodness moral goodness god particular christian believer must must basic standard god must fulfill lest attribution goodness becomes equivocal would say god wise omniscient perfectly knowing yet god actually knowing whether exist god care suffering people point could prima facie expect prevent stop god good might good way squirrel bodily part good good relevant sense believer profess - would strike many u severely defective impossible purely actual source existence perfection needed get problem evil going however amazes people realize god moral agent line metaphysically problematic many moral agency pure perfection classical theism per se also classical theist deny knowledge god also solves problem evil expense making god unworthy love worship believer well severely defective limited many metaphysicians,feser,3613,0,951

To make a choice, one needs to intend something, but if there are in reality no good or bad things them why would the First Cause intend anything?

"Modern physics is quantum mechanical. The founders of modern physics (Heisenberg, Bohr, Born etc...) understood that the ontology behind classical physics had been proven wrong by experimental results that could only be explained through quantum mechanics. Heisenberg understood that physicists must now resign themselves (see below). This means that physics is no longer ontological at all but now presupposes existence (this was always the case but classical, Newtonian physics made it easy to neglect this fact). If you want ontology you have to go to philosophy which inevitably leads to theology (see Przywara ""Analogia Entis"").      “...The atomic physicist has had to resign himself to the fact that his science is but a link in the infinite chain of man's argument with nature, and that it cannot simply speak of nature ""in itself"".

"Is papal teaching on faith and morals _always_ infallible, even when not presented either _ex cathedra_ or as a mere reiteration of teaching independently known to be infallible? The Church has not only never claimed this, but deliberately stopped short of claiming it when affirming papal infallibility at the First Vatican Council (despite the fact that some at the time were pushing for this stronger claim). Hence, that popes are not infallible when not teaching in the manner I’ve described is commonly acknowledged by theologians and churchmen (and, it is worth noting, by traditionalists, conservatives, and liberals alike). Yet in recent years, some overenthusiastic admirers of Pope Francis, keen to defend his more controversial remarks, have argued for the stronger claim.

"Thanks to all for your discussion of a particular specific, bold, plan of action. I find any such analysis to be superior to vague claims such as ""racism is bad, and isn't that sad"" which seem to dominate so much of our culture's discussion of race.      It's entirely reasonable to challenge, and perhaps dismiss, any particular plan of action. But the way to do that is to replace one plan with another, not to merely content ourselves with rejectionism.      What typically happens is that somebody will suggest some plan, everyone else will immediately starting proclaiming it wrong, while offering no plan of their own, and so nothing happens, and centuries of racial divide continues.

" _Like for example, what if a country with buddhist majority decided to take certain steps to promote and preserve their faith and culture by banning catholic missionaries from preaching and bringing people to the faith.      That wouldn't be right yes, What if the relevant authorities were to cite a catholic integralist country where other faiths were banned from preaching as justification ( a hypothetical ofcourse)._      I have no problem with a Buddhist country enacting laws that prevent Catholic missionaries from preaching a different (i.e. Catholic) faith _in ways that are unjust_. I would argue that this merely means that, at the same time, the laws must allow for Catholic preaching of a new (to the Buddhists) religion in ways that ARE just, i.e. that give **due** deference to the just requirements of the virtues of truth.      For example, a new religion, if it is to be allowed to be even _considered_ (by any of the Buddhists) as a possible replacement for Buddhism, must be able to provide bona fides that _justify_ a Buddhist taking seriously ""maybe my religion is importantly incomplete regarding religious truth, let's hear more"". Because Catholic missionaries have always relied on the possibility of God **providing just such testimonies for the bona fides of Catholicism** that justly require (to those with openness to the truth) a reconsideration of long-held positions - i.e. miracles, and heroic holiness of life. These two kinds of testimony licitly provide due reason, in ANY wholesomely lawful society without Catholicism, a rational basis to permit at least a discussion and comparison of their traditional religion and Catholicism. And, in actual historical fact, _God has not stinted_ in providing these kinds of witness to His Church as to its divine origin. These principles are quite explicitly laid out in Vatican II's document on religious liberty, Dignitatis Humanae.      As a result, it is possible to consider, as just, laws that first require Catholic missionaries to first present themselves to the king (or other authority), and to be subject to examination and interrogation by the king's religious experts, before being allowed to preach to others. And in fact Catholic missionaries have sometimes done EXACTLY THAT. What is impossible is that a country would _justly_ have laws that utterly and completely forbid _anyone_ to even entertain a missionary's request to propose to them new religious claims. That sort of law would be opposed to the virtues of truth, which require of men to be _open_ to truth proposed on just grounds (i.e. grounds compatible with the demands of reason). (A comparable principle requires of ALL men that they _seek_ to know God as much as they might be able, and therefore make of it an intellectual and moral failing to live one's life wholly without reference to _even considering_ whether there is a higher good to which we have some relation.

"I think people sometimes take original sin too much like a theory of physics. Once you do that it can lead to misunderstandings. Perhaps think of it instead as God creating nature with a telos, in fact a hierarchy of teloi, with everything drawn towards his divine idea(l)s (using Augustines terms). What the fall represents is us starting to choose our own sub-teloi, of having “knowledge” of what is “good” for us. Once we do the conscious choosing, we generally do a pretty bad job of it, as can be seen immediately with Cain, and that has consequences that ripple across everything. Like a stone thrown into a calm pond.      In order to recover our correct place in nature so that we can become participants in God’s original creation, working with him rather that towards our own faulty choice of sub-telos, we have to aim towards God’s original idea(l) of man.      Fortunately He has helped us hugely here. The incarnation was not just(!) the sacrifice that gained the reconciliation of the consequences of our bad choices, it also gave us the perfect example of the divine ideal we were created to be. So in choosing to be more like him, as far as we can in our puny efforts, we become participants in God’s great act of creation that is this universe (and we get help in this). On this path even the delights of the world become good, and we can have life to the full (though not without suffering yet).      If we don’t - but rather continue to create our own sub-teloi - then even good intentions can lead us away from completion, away from union with the creator. For those whose chosen teloi, their highest good and highest desires, are the base pleasures of the world, it is them who are choosing eternal torment.

"Kant was one of the world's greatest thinkers. He phillosophy foresaw quantum mechanics.      Kant did not view things-in-themselves as containing the sum of all possibilities, and phenomena all actualities; but this duality is conformable to Kant's metaphysics as to none other. As a contribution to the metaphysics of possibility, the quantum mechanical wave function can easily be seen as complementary to Kant's idea of things-in-themselves, where various kinds of things can happen (like free will) that are not comprehensible in terms of phenomenal reality. Kant would just have to allow that characteristics of physical reality can intrude some depth into things-in-themselves, which he would not have considered -- though we can also handle this by positing an intermediate level of reality, between true unconditioned things-in-themselves and true discrete phenomenal objects -- as Kant otherwise actually does himself for space and time as ""pure intuitions."" The wave function straddles the classic Kantian boundary, sharing some properties with phenomena, others, as underlying phenomena, with things-in-themselves.      Thus, where Kant would have considered all of phenomena governed by determinism, we now see the wave function as deterministic, while the collapse of waves into particles is random. Although chance in quantum mechanics has often been argued as allowing for free will, a free cause is still a very different thing from a random cause, which doesn't need mind or self or intention. Moral freedom is thus still left among things-in-themselves. Kant himself would have had difficulty placing randomness in his ontology, if he, like Hume, believed that chance violates determinism. Since chance is now part of the physics, it cannot be denied; but it also still remains a different matter from purposive freedom.      Kant's idea that space and time do not exist among things-in-themselves has been curiously affirmed by Relativity and quantum mechanics. In Relativity, time simply ceases to pass at the velocity of light: for photons that have travelled to us as part of the Cosmic Background Radiation, time has stood still for most of the history of the universe. On the other hand, quantum mechanics now posits ""non-locality,"" i.e. physical distances, and so the limitation of the velocity of light in Relativity, don't seem to exist. This means that although time may apply to the wave function, space may not. The full empirical reality of space is only found among discrete particles and objects.      This curious result is the consequence of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Paradox, which was intended by Einstein as a reductio ad absurdum of quantum mechanics. If, for instance, a positron and an election are both created from an energetic photon, the conservation of angular momentum requires that one be spinning one way, and the other the other. But the complementary spins are equally probable for each particle. Thus, in quantum mechanical terms, the wave functions of each particle divide without a discrete state being determined. The particles might then separate to even cosmological distances, but as soon as the spin of one particle is observed, the other particle must have the opposite spin, which means that the wave function has collapsed across those cosmological distances and caused the other particle to assume a predictable spin. If this occurs instantaneously, it would violate the limitation of the velocity of light in Special Relativity.

"I have always stopped short of making that judgment myself, simply because I don’t know all the facts and don’t know his heart – and because I have long had a deep affection for the man that makes me want to think the best. Still, in my view, the story of our times, both in the world and in the Church, is more than anything else a story of men failing to live up to their duties as fathers, providers, protectors – and of the catastrophic consequences that follow when they fail.

"In Article 6, Aquinas explains why the Incarnation was not put off until the end of the world (as it might seem it should have been, given the considerations adduced in the previous Article). Once again he makes several points, and the first is, I think, most easily explained in terms of the language of efficient and final causes (though Aquinas himself does not here use those terms). As he said in the previous article, because with human beings imperfection precedes perfection, it was fitting that the perfection of the Incarnation be preceded by the imperfection of human history between the fall of our first parents and the time of Christ. Now, you might think of the Incarnation as the _final_ cause or end toward which that history pointed. And in our experience, the realization of an end or final cause comes _later_ in time than the processes that lead to it.",article aquinas explains incarnation put end world might seem given consideration adduced previous article make several point first think easily explained term language efficient final cause though aquinas use term said previous article human being imperfection precedes perfection fitting perfection incarnation preceded imperfection human history fall first parent time christ might think incarnation final cause end toward history pointed experience realization end final cause come later time process lead,feser,873,0,988
"Isn't that what affirmative action effectively already does to some extent, which, incidentally, is on the chopping block? Except here, no rich people need to shave any money off their bank accounts. And hasn't it failed? And wasn't it just a lazy way of pretending to solve what is essentially a cultural problem? (Recent African immigrants, by contrast, do very well, academically and professionally, even after our previous American schools teach them that, despite what their lying eyes tell them, they are, in fact, oppressed, that there's no sense in denying it, and the only way out of the invisible cage is through rage and self-pity.)      But more to the point... By making things concrete, you make them tractable, and when you make them tractable, you make it possible to arrive at a goalpost. But who wants that? Once a problem is resolved, careers and institutions built around the problem are threatened because you've taken away their very raison d'etre. They no longer have the cudgel or leverage they once had.      The same is true of feminism. Many feminist demands have been met. But has feminism gone away? If anything, it's become even more radicalized. People often project their personal dissatisfactions and discomforts onto some external, broad ""common cause"". Doing so allows them to feel in control, like they've named the beast. Living a boring life? Must be because of racism. Not getting what you want? Must be because of sexism or misogyny. And once the demands of such people are met, they discover they're still where they were and this is infuriating. A rational person would take this as an opportunity for reflection, but a prideful person will simply double down. If things are still shabby, it's necessarily because we haven't gone far enough!

"Well if you just take a quick online survey of all the orthodox catholic philosophers/academics (Dr Matthew Levering, Dr Chris Kaczor, Dr Scott Hahn , Dr Michael Patrick Barber, Dr Jennifer Frey, Dr Robert P George etc) and analyse their public statements , you would probably find that Prof Feser has been the most critical and open about his reservations with regards to this papacy.      As for negativity, the very reason why there has been an increase of posts on these topics is that, Prof.Feser thinks that Pope Francis is close to committing heresy, hence the urgency to show that it is possible for a Pope to commit heresy so that it isn't seen as some kind of novelty, which is kind of a bleak or negative outlook don't ya think ?

"What ""technical point"" is that, P? That a man is deemed innocent until proven guilty? Or that in criminal cases in common law legal regimes the standard of proof is ""beyond reasonable doubt""?      Now I'm sure in all your concern for justice for all parties you'll have done this, but just in case, I invite you and all those who stand with you to do what I've done. Go to St Patrick's Cathedral Melbourne Australia with the scenario of the accusers under one arm and a stopwatch (available on your mobile) in your other hand. Click the stopwatch at start. Walk from the beginning of the nave (ie just before the steps up to the free-standing altar) at a processional pace down the aisle of the nave, out the West door, try to ignore the fact that maybe the Archbishop might have stopped on the steps to chat with some congregants, thus separating himself from the liturgical procession (but not from his personal assistant priest at the time, Fr Charles Portelli), as was his continual practice, not disputed. Just go with the slowly moving procession around the Cathedral, which ended in the very sacristy of the alleged deed. Click your stopwatch off. You can do this. Or at least you could when I did it a few years back. Tell me how it was physically possible for the Archbishop, on the first Sunday after his enthronement, to excuse himself from the parishioners at the West door, get round to the cathedral sacristy, be surprised to find two young choir boys there (one of whom, before he sadly died, denied to his mum that he was ever sexually abused by any priest) swigging altar wine, think ""Great! I'll rape these two young lads"" and do both deeds which the complainant said took a couple of minutes (!!), and cover up the fact - getting the boys (one of whom denied this ever happened, it needs to be reiterated) out of there and zipping up, as it were - before the liturgical procession arrived in the very same room.      The timing shows up the flimsiness of the accusation. We are asked to believe that with a bevy of people about to descend on the room in a time unknown to me in the moment, but possibly just seconds away, I can rape two boys (one of whom denied to his mother that he was ever sexually abused, I need to repeat this) dispatch them, zip myself up and get away with it.      Put up or shut up.      As to your reference to the RC's now released findings: B.S. Pell ""should have known""... Rubbish. For a year in 1980, I lived in a room in a boarding school next to a creep, but a personable chap, that was getting boarders drunk and abusing them on a nightly basis. The walls were concrete so admittedly sound proof. I had no idea what was going on, only finding out years later. Ex- priest and no fan of Pell Paul Bongiorno admitted on national radio that he lived with then Fr Pell and the serial sex offender Fr Ridsdale, but that he had no idea what this creep (but also himself abused, mind you, which shows up the perpetuating nature of this evil) was doing on a regular basis.

"1) I think the participationism explanation is problematic, since by that same logic one could maybe deny one truly possesses being or goodness or value; one could even deny one causes anything at all, concluding occasionalism. But we do have our own being & goodness, so it's not the divine being & goodness in us, per Aquinas.         2) In fact, there's a real sense in which our actions & thereby accomplishments are uniquely our own in a way they aren't God's precisely because our actions are rooted in our secondary causality, which is distinct from God's causality. And secondary causality being distinct from primary causality, the causal responsibility for secondary causal acts is in the creature, since the primary causality of God in sustaining our actions in existence only determins them insofar as they exist, but we determine them insofar as whether we cause them to occur (the occurrence of them is distinct from their basic existence) and what we cause to occur.      3) Additionally, there may be a difference between bragging and general pride - some moral theology manuals seem to suggest being proud of one's accomplishments isn't sinful, because that's distinct from bragging morally. And one can't be proud of things one doesn't truly possess or cause in some way.      Of course, other sources say any form of pride is sinful, so this isn't a clear issue it seems - but if one did take the route that some forms of pride ARE morally okay, then this makes the thesis we don't possess anything, whether being or our actions, unlikely.",think participationism explanation problematic since logic one could maybe deny one truly posse goodness value one could even deny one cause anything concluding occasionalism goodness divine goodness u per aquinas fact real sense action thereby accomplishment uniquely way precisely action rooted secondary causality distinct causality secondary causality distinct primary causality causal responsibility secondary causal act creature since primary causality god sustaining action existence determins insofar exist determine insofar whether cause occur occurrence distinct basic existence cause occur additionally may difference bragging general pride - moral theology manual seem suggest proud accomplishment sinful distinct bragging morally one proud thing one truly posse cause way course source say form pride sinful clear issue seems - one take route form pride morally okay make thesis posse anything whether action unlikely,pruss,1558,1,1003
"“ Psalm 50:11: I know all the birds of the mountains; And the wild beasts of the field are mine.”      Where suffering of animals is as part of nature, we must trust that to God. Life could not have evolved without suffering, and we must trust that the rich tapestry of dark and light is perfectly rounded in the end. “All is well” as He told Julian of Norwich. This is just faith in God’s goodness, and I have confidence that the great suffering of animals in nature will make be a necessary part of a perfect plan when we see things as they are.      Where it’s caused by humans, we are responsible. We each are called to play our part in reducing the suffering of others, as far as we are able. I can’t judge a poor person who overworks a donkey to build a house, or buys factory farmed meat, but those who can afford to support better welfare and always choose the cheapest/cruelest must be at least partly responsible for the cruelty.      It’s similar with children. We can’t see God’s full plan, but we know that life is short for all of us next to eternity. We can only play our part in reducing it where we can, and trust the rest to God.      As Augustine alludes to, some who have suffered the most can become the purest, most loving people you could meet. Others become hard and cruel. God is refining us like “silver in the furnace”. If we go with the process as he asks us to, and most of the saints actually welcome suffering in themselves, we have good reason to believe that it’s to our benefit in the long run. Most difficult of course is when it’s others suffering, especially those we love. But it’s exactly the same in that we can do what we can to help (including righteous anger in the very rare cases where that is the right response), but must do all we can to avoid becoming hard and cruel ourselves in response. Difficult as it may be, we must trust. We must try to see that what is sharp and apparently meaningless in the moment, is very different from the widest perspective.      Ultimately we are all called to follow the “suffering servant”, born to “Our Lady of Sorrows”.

"And also: I have quite explicitly said in previous posts that if there is a problem here, it has to do with the God's intention/reasons for X being the same as God's intention/reasons for ~X. That is a different issue which is only tangentially related with divine creative freedom - the actual problem there is with the multiplicity of divine ideas. I can grant (as I have granted before) that there can be an objection from the fact that prima facie in DS God's ideas would all be the same, but there should be a multiplicity, etc. This is something that strikes us as being quite different from how us humans think (and by extension, intend things).      This is not the problem of ""how could God freely cause different things in different worlds without any intrinsic differences in God between worlds???"". I have been very clear and precise in my comments that it is *this* that I think is a bad objection which would also affect LFW for humans, not just God. And I have explained why.      So, using the terms in our latest posts: if we are to assume these ""Wills"" as you want, they would have to not determine the action. Someone would have both the ""Will-to-X"" and the ""Will-to-not-X"" and then be able to indeterministically cause either X or ~X in that case. So there would be no intrinsic difference in the subject required for him to cause X or cause ~X in that situation. The same as God.      What you CAN object is that, differently from us, under DS in God the ""Will- to-X"" would be the same as the ""Will-to-not-X"" and you could think that this is absurd. But then as I said this is a different objection - it's basically the issue of the multiplicity of divine ideas, only tangentially related to free choice (if one thinks ideas are required for choices). The issues of ""5 is different than 2!"" etc. I have talked about this in my last reply to Vincent.

That is completely wrong, in that it would destroy the unity of an action and would lead to a vicious regress regarding volition. Rather ""choose x"" and ""x occurs"" is a simultaneous causal relationship of an action of a volitional agent.      A better description of LFW here (in its most bare bones form as self- generated action; deliberation is a type of it) is not so much in weighing scales, but something like picking a point on a circle: namely, insofar as the formula of a circle only provides an undifferentiated sea of possibles but no actual ones, I have to actualize some particular point, and prior to that actualization, the point is just a mere possible, not something with an individual actual reality; it cannot even be considered of itself a true individual reality apart from my actualization.      You could say that relies on a dubious notion of an infinity of options, but the basic idea does not change even for finite options. Suppose I have C = {X, Y}. C taken of itself is just an undifferentiated sea of possibles, to get X I would need C[0] while for Y I would need C[1]. That caused ""indexing"" is just what a self-determined action is. Since that ""indexing"" is not prior to the action but simultaneous with it, it is self-determined and free; nor is it some random ""coin flip"" because the 0ing and 1ing are not some earlier floating states (which would also generate a vicious regress as above) but coincident with the volition itself. In fact, it is more accurate to describe ""0ing"" and ""1ing"" as descriptions of self-determinations, not as ""things"".      The major issue I see being made here is regarding a volitional act as something like picking from already existent states competing for dominance.",rather lively discussion concerning lfw long lacking respect divine freedom indirect extent modal collapse rundec walter far tell hidden assumption event causation namely choose x event leading x occurs completely wrong would destroy unity action would lead vicious regress regarding volition rather choose x x occurs simultaneous causal relationship action volitional agent better description lfw bare bone form self- generated action deliberation type much weighing scale something like picking point circle namely insofar formula circle provides undifferentiated sea possible actual one actualize particular point prior actualization point mere possible something individual actual reality can not even considered true individual reality apart actualization could say relies dubious notion infinity option basic idea change even finite option suppose c x c taken undifferentiated sea possible get x would need c would need c caused indexing self-determined action since indexing prior action simultaneous self-determined free random coin flip ing ing earlier floating state would also generate vicious regress coincident volition fact accurate describe ing ing description self-determination thing major issue see made regarding volitional act something like picking already existent state competing dominance,feser,2053,0,1012

"@ Mr. Jindra,      While you are stuck in your solipsistic cage, let's give you some questions to think about. You made the claim above that principles or laws of logic are material. Now this leaves me with some questions. Now keep in mind that if you try to communicate back, I will not understand as I have not seen your Truman show. However, since you have seen mine, I know that you will understand the points I am driving at by my questions. This will give you some food for thought while you are in your cage.      The first question is: could you tell us what study has identified the three movements of the intellect (understanding, judgement, syllogism) with particular elements on the periodic table? And, which elements are associated with which movement? And if not elements, perhaps compounds? If so, which compounds are associated with which movements? And is it that the compound has to be located in the person, or in the brain, or in a particular place in the brain at a particular time to have a particular thought? And if the compound present in one person when they think that thought, how do you know that this compound is *causing* the thought? Or are you identifying it with the thought? And how do you know it does not merely correspond with the thought rather than causing it or being identified with it? And if it were causing the thought or identified with it in *this person* how do you know that the same occurs in all people? If a certain element, compound, or process is associated with a thought in person A, how do you know that this occurs in all people in the world? And if it does not occur with all people in the world, how can you reduce understanding of some concept or some judgement with a particular element, compound or process?      These are just a few questions for you to chem on in your cage. Given how important evidence is to you, I am sure that you have evidential answers to all of these questions. If not, that would again show you to be a complete hypocrite and from your posts and our interaction, I know that this cannot be so....      Or perhaps you would tell us that you know none of the answers to these questions and that we just need to trust you that you are correct anyways. Well, given your omniscience about the upbringing of everyone on here that you interact with, that makes all the sense in the world. Just like you can know about everyone you interact with and they can't know about you, so you can require evidence of others but don't have to give it yourself.

"I have read Hart's ""That All Shall Be Saved"" and as far as I remember nothing in his argument required necessitarianism of any kind.      Yes, he did argue that it is IMPOSSIBLE for human beings to be damned. And yes, in a way he did argue that it was IMPOSSIBLE for God not to save all the people he had made, given God's moral perfection. But again, both of these propositions are fully compatible with God deciding to not create anything at all, or deciding to create a universe with no people. The only thing that follows from the impossibility of eternal damnation is the impossibility of eternal damnation, not that God absolutely had to create our universe and save everyone, or even had to create (and save) any people.      Whether Hart actually defends necessitarianism in other works might very well be possible. But it is completely irrelevant for universalism as well as his specific argument.      Fr. Rooney says ""If it is a necessary truth that all will be saved, something makes it so..."" but again, when universalists say that it is necessary that God will save everyone, they are speaking of a conditional necessity, I.e. GIVEN that God has created people, it is impossible that he would then fail to save all of them. The universalist is not saying that it is necessary for God to CREATE any world or a specific world and then save everyone; he is just saying it is impossible for God to create people and then have them be lost forever to eternal damnation or annihilation.

"I want to pick up on something that Todd said, above:      _authoritative magisterium (i.e. non-infallible)_      I have seen phrases similar to this in many comments (not just blog comments, but (probably even more) news articles and editorial comments in published sources. I want to cry 'foul' on the idea of an ""authoritative magisterium"" of the pope, being somehow a distinct category from his other stuff that he teaches that is, you know, NOT ""authoritative"" or not ""magisterial"" or not ""authoritatively magisterial"".      **There ain't no sich category"".**      At least, that's what I am inclined to argue, though I am willing to be given better material to become educated on the issue.      Pope's generally don't go around stating which of their teachings are ""authoritative"" or ""magisterial"". By coming from a bishop, they automatically _participate_ in the magisterial office of the Church. That's it. All bishops participate in that office, and they are all _authoritative_ when they exercise their authority to teach. Period.      The bishops (all of them) _must necessarily_ participate in the magisterial office of the Church in order to be the agents by which a teaching be infallibly taught _by the universal magisterium of the bishops around the world_. If they can do it SOME of the time, then they **have** the role. And they all have the authority.      Now, there are indeed different _degrees_ by which those teachings enjoy the protection of the Holy Spirit. THAT's open to ""full"" versus something lesser. A pope has a heavier hand in that _being protected_ than other bishops, but his participation in the magisterial office isn't _utterly_ unlike that of the other bishops. He can still err (as proven), and (more importantly) _just like the other bishops_ his teachings are capable of DIFFERENT DEGREES of commanding that respect that comes under ""religious assent"" from the people of the Church. A pope, just like other bishops, teaches some things mildly, some things firmly, and some things _very_ firmly, without invoking the infallibility of an ex cathedra declaration. Similarly, popes (and other bishops) teach some things _in identical fashion_ as those before him for many centuries had, for some things, while on other things he sets out with a new metaphor, or a new explanation for an old doctrine, and _all the degrees in between_ that carry all the possible degrees of assertiveness.      AND THEY DON'T SIT THERE TELLING US WHERE EACH STATEMENT LANDS on these scales of firmness, traditionalness, etc. Indeed, if anything, the popes and bishops are _highly_ reticent to STATE EXPLICITLY anything about how firmly our obligation of religious assent kicks in for most of the things they say. We are left discerning that by _various markers_ that are available, including tradition, tone of 'voice', type of teaching occasion or document, etc. But (short of a solemn declaration by an ecumenical council) these markers make such discernment a chore and often only _probable_. Such, I think, is the life of the educated Catholic.      I would propose that the only teaching stuff that comes from the bishops that is ""not magisterial"" is the stuff that they themselves SAY is uncertain, putting in qualifiers like ""I feel that this is right, but I don't insist upon it"" and ""there is room for disagreement on this"" and so on. Everything else is ""teachings"" and therefore is magisterial. That's what the office of bishop implies.",want pick something todd said authoritative magisterium ie non-infallible seen phrase similar many comment blog comment probably even news article editorial comment published source want cry foul idea authoritative magisterium pope somehow distinct category stuff teach know authoritative magisterial authoritatively magisterial sich category least inclined argue though willing given better material become educated issue generally go around stating teaching authoritative magisterial coming bishop automatically participate magisterial office church bishop participate office authoritative exercise authority teach period bishop must necessarily participate magisterial office church order agent teaching infallibly taught universal magisterium bishop around world time role authority indeed different degree teaching enjoy protection holy spirit open full versus something lesser pope heavier hand protected bishop participation magisterial office utterly unlike bishop still err proven importantly like bishop teaching capable different degree commanding respect come religious assent people church pope like bishop teach thing mildly thing firmly thing firmly without invoking infallibility ex cathedra declaration similarly pope bishop teach thing identical fashion many century thing thing set new metaphor new explanation old doctrine degree carry possible degree assertiveness sit telling u statement land scale firmness traditionalness etc indeed anything pope bishop highly reticent state explicitly anything firmly obligation religious assent kick thing say left discerning various marker available including tradition tone voice type teaching occasion document etc short solemn declaration ecumenical council marker make discernment chore often probable think life educated catholic would propose teaching stuff come bishop magisterial stuff say uncertain putting qualifier like feel right insist upon room disagreement everything else teaching therefore magisterial office bishop implies,feser,3468,0,1018

Nevertheless I did expres myself so I'll defend myself against some of the points you made.

I was just saying that Prof.Feser is trying to make that point as well.

Also, based on the Gospel, particularly the parable of the one lost sheep vs the 99 non-lost ones, we can safely presume that the incarnation would still have taken place just the same had it just been only me or you (a single human person) in existence that fell from grace.

"@Rafa      Hey bro, it's nice to see that our replies got to you! Sorry for taking so long to answer too - I ain't feeling very well.      Going straight to the point I must say that the existence of universals is one of the most important points in philosophy because its consequences/ what follows from it have a huge impact on how the world really is.      Nominalism has many varieties but I think it's safe to say that at the end of the day, all of them affirm the same damn thing (i.e the inexistence of universals) and fail exactly in it in different ways i.e they always smuggle universals in the background. It doesn't matter if its an Ockham variation, a Sellar's ""metalinguistic"" one, a buddhist one, or whatever (of course, to see how it fails specifically, you will have to dig into it, but there are other ways to see why this idea does not work in any way).      I personally like Ed's work (I am a fan and I'm not gonna lie about it) and in his TLS book, he gives direct proofs for realism and indirect ones. Personally, I love indirect proofs - because I think that if you could show that your philosophical adversary can't get rid of the concept/ or even presuppose the very concept he's trying to deny it's pretty much a good reason for knowing that it sure does exist and its a real thing. That's exactly the case of nominalism i.e it needs universals to even get off the ground!!      For example, when we (realists about universals) see a red thing and another one, it's pretty damn obvious that they share the exact same thing i.e redness even though they are different in other aspects. The nominalist will, of course, deny this fact. He's gonna say that ""it's not the same redness"" and that universals are ""free creations of the human mind to facilitate speaking"". But the basic problem that affects every single version of this idea is the fact the communication itself (i.e the proposition, the speech, the way he talks to other people) presupposes the very universals he's trying to deny and the fact that the conventional use or creation of things itself presuppose objective realities (just like to know what's an illusion or falsity itself presuppose a grasp of what truth is - it's a parasitic thing).      So, we are human beings and WE DO entertain concepts. Of course, if Agnetha Falstkog is prettier than Olivia Newton-John or if Brazilian BBQ is better than feijoada is a matter of opinion, it's a subjective matter. But the point is, we do entertain universal concepts that not just must be but ARE the very same concepts that you and I must entertain and they are, by their very nature, objective. One simple example is mathematics. When I think about the Pythagorean theorem or the number 7 and you think the very same thing it's simply impossible for them to be different things i.e if someone understands the Pythagorean theorem at all - or Bhaskara or whatever - it is the same thing that we are talking about. It's not like you are entertaining your private concept of the Pythagorean theorem and I am entertaining mine because if it was really that way communication would be impossible.      Consider science, for example. It is in the business of discovering the world around us - at least it should if not impregnated with ideology. But if scientists were not talking about atoms, electrons, spins, or whatever in a universal graspable manner i.e IN THE VERY SAME MANNER then we could only have particular concepts (that one shared by this scientist and another one shared by that other scientist) and we could not even be talking about the same thing - or discovering - the same thing. In short, realism is the only theory that does not turn scientific founding into a miracle - to paraphrase Hillary Putnam.      Of course, Ed goes through reasons why we should reject this by a lot of different arguments, but I tried to sum up everything so you could understand better. There are a lot of other examples and vicious regress lurking nominalism and other arguments showing how they presuppose universals instead of getting rid of the body.

"The mass of bound particles such as electrons and protons is less than the mass of their free counterparts. Thus a hydrogen atom has a smaller mass than the sum of the masses of a free electron and a free proton. This lost mass in the hydrogen atom is called the ""binding energy"" of the electron and the proton in the hydrogen atom.      If the masses of these particles are not less when they are bound then when they are free, then how could the total mass of the hydrogen atom be less than the sum of the individual free particles that make it up?      Some people posting here seem to think that such particles ""retain their identifying properties"" whether they are free or bound into a combination that makes up something like a crystal, a metal, a brain, or a red blood cell.      They do not as even such fundamental properties as mass change.      This is inconsistent with their claims, but is completely consistent with hylomorphism, in which a free electron has the potential to become something different, such as a bound electron, when it becomes active as part of a living body, and then again as it becomes part of a dead body - at least that is what the fundamental property, mass, tells us.

" _It seems to me that he ignores the many attempts that have been made to create Western Orthodoxies._      I cannot understand this.      Which is more like creating a schismatic severance from Christ's Church?      (1) Openly defying Vatican II's explicit requirement that the elements of the mass should (a) not be modified ""unless the good of the Church genuinely and certainly requires them"", and (b) changed by organic development rather than unnatural innovations imposed by mere fiat; and when people cling to the mass to which violence has been done, demand that they give it up not by valid and upright law, but by inference, implication, innuendo, canceling, and persecution by a thousand unlawful cuts. Or,      (2) When unlawful demands are made upon them, the people ignore those demands to remain attached to the mass as it was before violence was done to its form; the people ignore the cadging, name-calling, and vilifying of bishops (and popes) who call them ""rigid"" neo-Pelagians by continuing to pray for those bishops and popes while refusing to submit to said unlawful persecution by refusing to give up the old mass and the immemorial teachings of the Church.      In regards to my use of the term ""unlawful"" above, I make 2 points: First, after 40 years of people at the Vatican and below insisting (without evidence) that Paul VI had abrogated the right to say the old mass, Benedict said it wasn't so. Second, while in Traditiones Custodis the pope **could have demanded** that priests request of their bishop the right to continue to say the old mass, instead the actual language is that the priest ""should"" request it of their bishops - language which is advisory rather than imperative. (The interpretive stance Church law is that restrictive rules are to be interpreted narrowly, not expansively: an advisory is not a command that must be obeyed.) Yet bishops have ""interpreted"" TC by imposing demands _even more harsh and stringent_ than TC requires, without reason or need.",seems ignores many attempt made create western orthodoxy can not understand like creating schismatic severance church openly defying vatican explicit requirement element mass modified unless good church genuinely certainly requires b changed organic development rather unnatural innovation imposed mere fiat people cling mass violence done demand give valid upright law inference implication innuendo canceling persecution thousand unlawful cut unlawful demand made upon people ignore demand remain attached mass violence done form people ignore cadging name-calling vilifying bishop pope call rigid neo-pelagians continuing pray bishop pope refusing submit said unlawful persecution refusing give old mass immemorial teaching church regard use term unlawful make point first year people vatican insisting without evidence paul vi abrogated right say old mass benedict said second traditiones custodis pope could demanded priest request bishop right continue say old mass instead actual language priest request bishop - language advisory rather imperative interpretive stance church law restrictive rule interpreted narrowly expansively advisory command must obeyed yet bishop interpreted tc imposing demand even harsh stringent tc requires without reason need,feser,2005,0,1055

"It is actually possible to empirically test one of the various interpretations of QM - specifically the 'many worlds' one - albeit in a manner that would only impart information to the tester ( others would be in the position of having to take their claims on trust , but why should they? ). The necessary experiment is unlikely to appeal to many, but there may be some atheistic takers, suffering from a terminal condition and interested to know how things would turn out.      Basically, suppose that one sets up a 'suicide machine', in which, when a button is pressed, there is a 50% chance of some quantum event- an atomic decay say - causing effectively instantaneous death, so the subject would have no conscious indication should the decay occur. Following the 'many worlds' interpretation, when the subject presses the button the world will bifurcate into a 'region' where the decay has occurred and the subject is dead, and another where it did not and the subject is alive and well. Now the point is of course that there will be continuity of consciousness between worlds where the subject remains alive, so the subject will find that the suicide machine just will not work, no matter how many times the button is pressed or how many such machines or variations thereof are employed.

"Norm, you have commented at length about the right and need for society to be structured in such a way that women can take a wholesome, fully participatory place in the various venues such as medicine, law, education, etc. etc. I agree, in principle, and I am glad that my daughters will have far more open doors than my mother's generation did.      At the same time, there should be full credit to the fact that having women having open access to ""the professions"" **_is not_** logically equivalent to society treating women exactly the SAME as men in every single respect. For example, the Marine Corp has different requirements for women than it has for men on minimum strength and speed abilities. One can readily conclude that if they had for women the same requirements as they use for men, far, far fewer women would qualify for the Marine Corp. I am not debating whether the different scales is a good or bad thing - at the moment it is the reality, and without the different scales, nearly all women would be excluded.      But this is just one aspect of the larger reality: women and men are not identical in psychological and emotional ways, either. This implies that, broadly speaking, there will always be various professions / jobs that are better fit for women, and others better fit for men. It is not per se wrong for a society to take such differences into account in forming _traditions and customs_ , and to thereby mold its men and women _differently_ in regards to various professions. Demanding that a society be utterly blind to the differences between men and women in constructing its customs on ALL of its _professions_ , and thus to try to demand that all professions be **equally** open to men and to women, is to deny differences in both physical and non- physical attributes. (It would be no different, in principle, than demanding that every person be allowed to enter ANY profession, regardless of talent or intelligence _or training_ , i.e. let anybody be a doctor regardless of whether he was able to finish med school, let anybody be a doctor regardless of whether he went to law school, let anybody design bridges regardless of whether he learned engineering...)      In a nutshell: it is NOT WRONG that each society have norms and customs that mold and constrain people, even though those customs _are not intrinsically essential_ to moral behavior and a wholesome society. And given that, it is not wrong that SOME of those customs impinge on (and constrain) women more than on men, while others impinge on (and constrain) men more than on women. Thus, while it is perhaps possible that humans can arrange a worthy and wholesome society wherein no profession is off-limits to women, it is also perhaps possible that humans can have a worthy and wholesome society wherein the professions of midwife and lactation consultant are off limits to men.

"WCB      @Michael Copas      Whatever will we do with your devastating criticisms that no one else has ever considered before?      I have carefully examined a lot of classical theologians on this point.Augustine, Boethius, Ansalm, William of Okham, Duns Scotus, Aquinas, Molina and others. And some of the enormous modern secondary literature.      Augustine assert that though God foresees all he does not cause all. Boethius claims that as a man sees something, that man does not cause what he sees. Thus God sees future events but likewise does not cause them. And on and on it goes. Everybody is indeed wrong      The particular argument I posted is not answered by the nearly 1600 years of theologians trying to explain the issue of God's foreknowledge and free will. Not until Luther's ""Bondage Of The Will"" did the issue of this become a problem.      Late in his life after the Pelagian affair Augustine gave up on free will, which was followed by Calvin, Luther et all.      I am sure that somewhere somebody else has made the argument I have, but I have yet to see anybody that has among the theologian community.      The key concep I wrote about is if Go d decides to create a Universe, God must choose an initial states of creation. And that we are told by centuries of theologians God foresees the future. Based on biblical claims God does that.   Now all I do is follow these claims to their logical conclusion. No classical theologians had the wit to notice this problem. Today's answer from theists is that has all been answered long ago by classical theists. This is not true.

"Yes, I’d say that, if, in the case of nth expectation greater than c>0, someone takes SLLN (if it applies) as a reason to accept all the bets, then in your example they should refuse to accept all the bets – if they reason on the basis of a ‘with probability 1’ result in one case, they should also do so in the other. That said, you should take care to note exactly what the various authors are actually arguing.      Speaking for myself, I don’t think that any result about an actual infinity of bets, or even just about limits of finite sequences of bets, is in itself a good reason to do anything. (Though, of course, such results can give useful hints.) What matters is the likely position when the game ends, as, in the real world, it must.      In your example, the distribution of partial sums has progressively increasing variance and skewness. Roughly (if I’m thinking straight), variance of the nth partial sum grows like n, 3rd moment grows like (n^2)/2. The normalized 3rd moment (i.e. with the outcome divided by its s.d. to make the variance 1) grows like (n^(1/2))/2. If I were really offered this sequence of bets, with the option of choosing in advance how many to accept, I’d feel that for large n, things would get pretty hairy, way too hairy to justify accepting on the basis of the positive expectation, which only grows like ln(n)/2.

" _The Pope's teaching is different, because the Bishop of Rome is the successor of St. Peter,_      The non-infallible teachings of the popes can call forth from us a higher _degree_ of that religious assent we make to the Church's non-infallible teachings, than those of other bishops, because he is the successor of Peter.

"Let’s note also at the outset that the issue here is _not_ whether Catholics are ordinarily obligated to assent to papal teaching even when it is not put forward infallibly. The answer is that they _are_ ordinarily obligated. More precisely, they owe even non-definitive papal teaching what is called “religious assent,” which is not the unqualified assent owed to teaching put forward infallibly, but is nevertheless firm. To be even more precise, there is a very strong _presumption_ in favor of such assent, though the Church, in documents like _Donum Veritatis_ , has acknowledged that there can be rare cases in which this presumption is overridden and a faithful Catholic at liberty respectfully to raise questions about some magisterial statement. The clearest sort of case would be one where a magisterial statement appears to conflict with past definitive teaching.

"As usual, Professor, this is well done. However, I would ask you to make a clarification of an ambiguity that arises in 2 places in your post:      _The ordinary magisterium of the Church, and the pope when exercising it, are also infallible when they simply reiterate some doctrine that has been consistently taught for centuries...      as I have already acknowledged, a pope’s exercise of the ordinary magisterium can also be infallible when it involves reiterating doctrines consistently taught by the Church for centuries. _      These comments are similar but in part deficient in clarity when compared to another comment:      _Now, as already noted, the standard qualification would be that popes can err when neither speaking ex cathedra nor, in their ordinary magisterium, merely reiterating teaching already independently known to be infallible._      The issue I have is in that more precision is needed in speaking of the pope's ""ordinary magisterium"" and how it bears on infallibility.      First, I would suggest that it is probably a mistake to even use a phrase like ""the pope's magisterium"" at all. Not that the phrase is wrong altogether, but I think it creates a connotation that is unhappy: the **Church** has the teaching office as a whole, and the bishops _exercise_ that teaching office in a special way their fullness of the priestly orders. The bishops (including the popes) exercise the teaching office _in an ordinary way_ when they teach. The bishops exercise the teaching office _in an extraordinary way_ when they teach by solemn definition in ecumenical council.

"Hi Ed,      In your interview, you state:      ""You’ll also find – and this is something that I discuss in my book – that the Catholic Church and the popes have officially taught for five centuries now that the kind of slavery that was practiced in the New World and the kind of slavery represented by the African slave trade was intrinsically evil. The popes condemned this consistently from the beginning. Now, it’s true that there were a lot of people who simply ignored the teaching but that was indeed the teaching. People often have this false impression…that somehow the Church is a late comer to this. Well, no. In fact, the Church has been consistently condemning what’s called chattel slavery – or the treatment of other human beings as if they were mere pieces of property or as if they were animals or something – for centuries even if the teaching was, again, often ignored.""      I have to say that this is simply incorrect. I refer you to Pius Onyemechi Adiele's work, ""The Popes, the Catholic Church and the Transatlantic   Enslavement of Black Africans 1418-1839"" (Georg Olms Verlag AG, Hildesheim 2017), which was accepted as a Doctoral Dissertation in 2014 by the Faculty of Catholic Theology of the University of Tübingen. The author carried out his research at the Vatican Secret Archives (ASV) as well as the Portuguese National Archives (ANTT). His book is available online:      https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/id/8aa95306-9256-443f-9e89-de5871874288/external_content.pdf      With a wealth of impressively documented scholarship, Adiele demonstrates that the Popes actively supported the enslavement of Africans and the Transatlantic slave trade for nearly four centuries. He writes: ""Even in the face of numerous protests made by some anti-slavery proponents in both Europe and America against the continued unjust enslavement of Black Africans, none of the popes of the Church beginning from the renaissance papacy in the fifteenth century, throughout the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries and up to the first three decades of the nineteenth century ever remembered to hearken to those voices of protests so as to extend their fatherly concern towards Black Africans laboring under the chains of Transatlantic slavery... Even in the sixteenth century precisely in 1537 during the papacy of pope Paul III, when the papacy at last began to show interest in the sufferings of peoples held under the bondage of slavery by condemning the enslavement of the Indians of the West Indies, the Black Africans were left out and ignored in this papal interest in protecting those under enslavement... The papacy showed her concern for Black Africans in 1814 and 1823 respectively only at the motivation of the British government and only on the condition that the British government will help the Church to recover her lost Papal States which were taken away from her by the Napoleonic invasion and occupation of the Papal States in 1808.""

"Professor Pruss,      Here's a theological/philosophical question that I thought you might be interested in. Speaking to the multitudes, John the Baptist says that ""God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham"" (Luke 3:8). Setting aside any questions of historicity (e.g. whether Abraham was a historical figure, and so on), it can be safely assumed that John the Baptist (and those to whom he was speaking) regarded the Judeans as literal, biological descendants of Abraham. So it seems that, if taken at face value, he is saying that God could turn the stones into literal, biological descendants of Abraham. I wonder how this might bear on, for instance, essentiality of origins.      Of course, I think the solution is to avoid this sort of strict literalism, but either way, it's fun to think about.",professor pruss theologicalphilosophical question thought might interested speaking multitude john baptist say god able stone raise child abraham luke setting aside question historicity eg whether abraham historical figure safely assumed john baptist speaking regarded judeans literal biological descendant abraham seems taken face value saying god could turn stone literal biological descendant abraham wonder might bear instance essentiality origin course think solution avoid sort strict literalism either way fun think,pruss,821,1,1113

You might simply think someone is wrong on some issue, and the only consequence is what you might say in order to 'correct' them. Or, someone might be engaging in behaviour that is objectively wrong, but there is nothing really you can do to stop them, or it isn't your place to stop them(many kinds of sexual behaviour, for example). That's different from situations where the person might take advantage of yourself or other people. Such as, deciding whether to lend a large amount of money to someone. If you are the only one potentially affected, you might simply allow them to take advantage of you to a certain extent(Everyone has their limits). If other people are potentially harmed, though, then it is as you describe. It would be wrong to simply let them take advantage of others, so you really have to judge on what is more likely rather than beyond reasonable doubt, because no matter what you do, there will be a 'winner' & a 'loser' in that situation.",seems term judgement depends exactly stake lot time merely opinion another huge consequence might simply think someone wrong issue consequence might say order correct someone might engaging behaviour objectively wrong nothing really stop place stop themmany kind sexual behaviour example different situation person might take advantage people deciding whether lend large amount money someone one potentially affected might simply allow take advantage certain extenteveryone limit people potentially harmed though describe would wrong simply let take advantage others really judge likely rather beyond reasonable doubt matter winner loser situation,feser,1145,0,1114
"Dr. Feser, respectfully, you make a clear error here. The council being wrong about Honorious being a heretic would be an error in a judgment of historical fact, not a matter of faith and morals. The matter of faith and morals would be the judgment of monothelitism as heresy, which is entirely true and accurate; whether or not Honorious was a heretic is a matter of historical fact and judgment, and the Council is not and never has been stated to be protected on questions of that kind. You claim that judging Honorious to be a heretic is a matter of faith and morals, but this is wrong; the matter of faith and morals is the condemnation of the *teaching* as heresy. If a judgment of an individual as a heretic was protected infallibly, excommunications could not be lifted years after someone's death, yet this happens all the time.      If Honorious was using his authority as the Pope to teach - and I disagree that writing anything in a private letter rises to such authority, as when the Pope attempts to teach something to the universal church he addresses the Church directly - then Honorious cannot teach heresy. The reason is that we are obliged to give religious assent of will to anything a Pope teaches from the ordinary magisterium, and the Magisterium cannot bind us to sin.      Honorious was *possibly* a heretic by the standards the Councils were using at the time but absolutely *not* a heretic by the standards we use to judge heresy today, as monothelitism had not yet been definitively judged as false by the Church. If we were to call him a heretic in the way that Vatican I understands the term, we'd also have to call St. Thomas Aquinas a heretic for rejecting the Immaculate Conception.      So I disagree with your argument here. The Magisterium cannot teach heresy as understood by Vatican I's definitions of teach, heresy, and Magisterium, and Honorious did no such thing.",dr feser respectfully make clear error council wrong honorious heretic would error judgment historical fact matter faith moral matter faith moral would judgment monothelitism heresy entirely true accurate whether honorious heretic matter historical fact judgment council never stated protected question kind claim judging honorious heretic matter faith moral wrong matter faith moral condemnation teaching heresy judgment individual heretic protected infallibly excommunication could lifted year death yet happens time honorious using authority pope teach - disagree writing anything private letter rise authority pope attempt teach something universal church address church directly - honorious can not teach heresy reason obliged give religious assent anything pope teach ordinary magisterium magisterium can not bind u sin honorious possibly heretic standard council using time absolutely heretic standard use judge heresy today monothelitism yet definitively judged false church call heretic way vatican understands term also call st thomas aquinas heretic rejecting immaculate conception disagree argument magisterium can not teach heresy understood vatican definition teach heresy magisterium honorious thing,feser,1904,0,1115

"I noticed in this discussion that many dystopian physical and logical concepts are used, which is a common occurrence among those who lack an understanding of quantum physics, Aristotelian logic, and philosophy. To improve understanding, at his point, it is warmly recommended to grasp the difference between mixed states and pure quantum states. In quantum mechanics, a mixed state is a probabilistic mixture of pure states and is not a pure state itself. Thus, it does not conform to the requirements of being a vector in a Hilbert space, which is necessary for describing pure quantum states. Mixed states cannot be represented by a wavefunction and require the use of density matrices for their mathematical description. Having a clear understanding of these concepts will aid in discussions about the EPR paradox, contextuality, and entanglement. Ultimately, a sound understanding of the underlying logical structure is necessary for sensible discussions in these topics.

"Now, the Gentiles too needed a proper conception of the divine nature if they were correctly to understand the central claims of Christianity once it was propagated beyond its original Jewish context. Suppose your understanding of the divine were molded entirely by stories about the gods of Olympus, or by myths about dying deities like Adonis, Attis, Osiris, or Dionysus. Then the Trinity will sound like just another pantheon, the virginal conception of Jesus will be interpreted as comparable to Zeus’s impregnation of various mortal women, and the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus will be reminiscent of a dying and rising fertility god. In other words, they will seem to be mere variations on familiar pagan themes. However, if instead you conceive of God as the purely actual prime unmoved mover of the world (as in Aristotelianism), or as the non-composite One from which all else derives (as in Neo-Platonism), then the claims of Christianity will sound as shocking as they did to the Jews of the first century.

Whatever is moved by accident is not moved by itself, since it is moved upon the motion of another. So, too, as is evident, what is moved by violence is not moved by itself. Nor are those beings moved by themselves that are moved by their nature as being moved from within; such is the case with animals, which evidently are moved by the soul. Nor, again, is this true of those beings, such as heavy and light bodies, which are moved through nature. For such beings are moved by the generating cause and the cause removing impediments. Now, whatever is moved is moved through itself or by accident. If it is moved through itself, then it is moved either violently or by nature; if by nature, then either through itself, as the animal, or not through itself, as heavy and light bodies.

"""Being infinitely good, would it not go against His nature to choose a lesser good, as against a better one? Similarly, would it not go against His nature to to choose not to create, if He knows that the choice to create is better?""      I am also puzzled by this. But since I am not bound by dogma, I am open to accepting that God creates out of a necessity of his perfect nature. But it'd be nice if it can be avoided.      So there's a lot to be said about this, and what I'll mention doesn't come close to covering the whole topic, but I think it's an interesting thought, and maybe an escape route. Consider: one could deny that perfect goodness MUST entail always doing the best, if the best is supererogatory. The very notion of a supererogatory action is that it's a good action you can perform without being anything like an obligation. We can imagine you can, for instance, donate 100 dollars to a charity right now, and it would be good and virtuous of you, but it wouldn't be an obligation. You can fail to do it without thereby incurring in sin or evil.      I think creation might be a supererogatory good like that. If it's supererogatory, then God would be very willing to create (or create the best) without nevertheless *having* to create. So you could say God is somehow likely to perform supererogatory actions, but not determined (thus preserving contingency).      I don't think this works for the problem of evil or anything like that (I very much believe God must, for example, prevent or stop a torture if there is no greater good to be gained from permitting it), but I think it's a nice enough candidate to solve the necessitarian issue",infinitely good would go nature choose lesser good better one similarly would go nature choose create know choice create better also puzzled since bound dogma open accepting god creates necessity perfect nature nice avoided lot said mention come close covering whole topic think interesting thought maybe escape route consider one could deny perfect goodness must entail always best best supererogatory notion supererogatory action good action perform without anything like obligation imagine instance donate dollar charity right would good virtuous obligation fail without thereby incurring sin evil think creation might supererogatory good like supererogatory god would willing create create best without nevertheless create could say god somehow likely perform supererogatory action determined thus preserving contingency think work problem evil anything like much believe god must example prevent stop torture greater good gained permitting think nice enough candidate solve necessitarian issue,feser,1663,0,1128

My open theism is based on the openness of the future (I agree with Pruss and many others that foreknowledge of free acts requires eternalism, but I am a presentist, so I reject foreknowledge of free acts). In other words: there is no difference at all in our views of God - I also believe that he must know every true fact. The difference between us is that I do not believe there are any true facts of what we will choose. Only what we choose or have chosen. So there is nothing for God to know there.      How can God ""learn"" what we choose without undergoing intrinsic change? The same way God can learn any contingent facts without undergoing intrinsic change. Classical theists believe God's knowledge of contingents is externalist and involves only Cambridge changes for him. You already have to believe that God's knowledge differs between worlds without that entailing any change in his intrinsic properties. Even with foreknowledge you have to believe that God only knows what you will do IFF God contingently creates you (unless you are a Molinist - which thomists reject - or you believe God creates of necessity). So you're on the same boat as me when it comes to having to account for God's contingent knowledge without real change. The only difference, again, is that I think there is nothing to know re: ""future choices"".      So no, open theism does not entail God being temporal. I wholeheartedly agree that God is outside of time. But unlike what some (very confused) thomists think, that does not mean that God can ""see the future"" as if there were anything to see there (unless, again, you are an eternalist/B theorist).",talmid way classical theism contingent knowledge go together open theism based openness future agree pruss many others foreknowledge free act requires eternalism presentist reject foreknowledge free act word difference view god - also believe must know every true fact difference u believe true fact choose choose chosen nothing god know god learn choose without undergoing intrinsic change way god learn contingent fact without undergoing intrinsic change classical theist believe knowledge contingent externalist involves cambridge change already believe knowledge differs world without entailing change intrinsic property even foreknowledge believe god know iff god contingently creates unless molinist - thomists reject - believe god creates necessity boat come account contingent knowledge without real change difference think nothing know future choice open theism entail god temporal wholeheartedly agree god outside time unlike confused thomists think mean god see future anything see unless eternalistb theorist,feser,1722,0,1134

"Hi Ed,      The central problem with the design argument, as you point out, is that in and of itself, it can only take us to a cosmic architect, who could be merely a Demiurge, rather than a Creator. But I put it to you that traditional, cosmological arguments have a problem of their own: all they establish is the existence of an Ultimate Cause, or Necessary Being, which may or may not be personal - i.e. an intelligent moral agent.      Defenders of the traditional arguments typically attempt to rectify this deficiency by arguing that (i) the Ultimate Cause or Necessary Being must be Pure Being itself, (ii) Pure Being is infinite and utterly unlimited, and (iii) anything which is infinite and utterly unlimited must be intelligent and capable of moral agency - not merely as one agent among many, but as the Agent from which other agents derive their ability to act.      The problem with this line of reasoning, as I see it, is that even granting (i) and (ii), (iii) does not follow. Intelligence is not a mode of being; therefore even a perfect and unlimited Being need not be intelligent. Nor does God's intelligence follow from his being the Ultimate Cause, for the cause of X need not possess any knowledge of X. One might try to argue that whatever contains the form of X must somehow know it, but this is dumbing down the definition of knowledge. There is no reason to suppose that the mere ability to produce an object’s form gives the producer a knowledge of that form – even in cases when the producer is an immaterial agent. How do we know that He is acting intentionally, in producing the forms which are instantiated in our universe?      The only solution to this problem, as I see it, is to make the notion of a Personal Agent ontologically fundamental, and attempt to argue that impersonal agents (such as bodies) are, in fact, pale imitations of personal agents: blind rule-followers stripped of any intentionality. John Macmurray defended this approach to God in his Gifford Lectures of 1953-54, later published as ""The Self as Agent"" and ""Persons in Relation.""

"Tadeo,   I myself struggled with that question for quite some time. For a while I held that God couldn't know the future because the future is not, and the act of knowing necessarily requires that which is, but fortunately some friends talked me out of that one. To my understanding, the answer (insofar as we can get to it) involves distinguishing between absolute necessity (i.e. it follows from the nature of the thing) and conditional necessity (which is brought about by a specific set of circumstances) and having a proper understanding of God's eternal knowledge (not foreknowledge) as a presentialist view, wherein God sees all things which are (for us) past, present, and future all as the present and immediately available. This knowledge of what presently is does not necessarily preclude the rational agent from choosing to do otherwise in that moment other than what he or she was already doing, i.e. it is conditionally necessary and not absolutely necessary.

Wow, infinite growth. You are quite the wizard with your knowledge of both Church history and exegesis of Scripture and the internal state of every Catholic on the planet. Apparently you have arrived and all of us wayward Catholics just need to give up and stop trying. What a quaint little idea.      Regarding your expertise in the inward working of every Catholic on the planet: how did you arrive at such expansive knowledge? Ah, the bible (as interpreted by my Protestant instructors) tells me so. Yet another quaint little idea.      Quoting Romans 7:7-8 tells you precisely zero about whether or not every Catholic in the world is unrepentant. You are just reading into the bible your own foregone conclusions which stem from a heretic who invented a novel teaching on justification in the 1500s. And before you make assumption that Catholics just don't know their Scripture, I have translated the Pentateuch from the Hebrew of the Masoretic Text and the Greek of the LXX and have translated the entire new testament including Romans. The text you are quoting does precisely nothing to support your Protestant novelties and you are simply reading into it your own foregone conclusions.      You suggest that we should not make effort in regards to salvation and read that into Romans. Well that suggestion would be news to Paul who wrote that we must ""work out our salvation with fear and trembling."" No smug Protestant assurance in St. Paul.      Regarding the false dichotomy that we either don't try and recognize that God saves us or we try our best and think that we save ourselves; this sad Protestant trope has nothing to do with the Bible and Apostolic Christianity which affirms that we must work out our salvation with fear and trembling and that God brings about our salvation through grace. The conjunction of those two things is what the bible teaches and you pit them against one another because you are steeped in Protestantism which originated in a denial of secondary causality.

" _Insofar as metaphysics and religion both deal with matters that are not strictly evidentiary._      I can't say I agree with this hypothesis.      The sciences (all sciences, including the most firm and certain) all rely on _principles_ that they use in drawing conclusions. For instance, they all rely on principles of logic. You can't assert conclusions from experiments without using the principles of logic.      Philosophy provides some of those principles. Indeed, ""Philosophy of science"" is (or ought to be) considered a discipline that is foundational to the sciences. (And the discipline of logic is, itself, foundational to the philosophy of science, so it too is foundational to science.) The fact that _scientists_ often may be ignorant of the issues that trouble the prior disciplines doesn't mean that they are not USING the results of those disciplines, just as they might not bother to expend huge efforts on studying symbolic logic when they use principles of logic.      And the notion that the discipline of the philosophy of science is ""not evidentiary"" and therefore something lesser than ""science"" is just a non- starter: like the discipline of logic, science simply cannot function without the results handed to it by sound philosophy of science, and its **use of evidence** relies on sound philosophy of science. If one wishes to take all of philosophy as diminished in standing because it is ""non-evidentiary"", then one diminishes science itself.      Metaphysics, like logic, provides some of the underpinnings upon which the philosophy of science operates. You cannot have a sound philosophy of science with an unsound metaphysics in the background.      _Are religion and philosophy neighbors on the plane? It would seem so. They certainly are in university humanities departments, had you not noticed. And so, is religion philosophy? There is evidence of this. Belief, after Davidson, is a propositional attitude, and both religion and philosophy are propositional._      The fact that universities place ""religion"" and ""philosophy"" in the same boat is evidence, rather, that universities are operating on a BAD set of underlying positions regarding thought, knowledge, etc. For example, they treat propositions that _can't be proven_ and are held to be in contention to constitute ""matters for 'belief' rather than matters for 'knowledge"". But a proper understanding of metaphysics and knowledge allows for truths that can be known _without proof_ , i.e. first principles that can be known DIRECTLY rather than via a proof: self-evident principles. The rejection of this category by moderns is a _methodological_ mistake that causes the mistaken _assumption_ that ""philosophy"" is not about things that can be known, but only believed.      It would be just as coherent to say ""science is propositional, and rests on the _belief_ that we can rely on experimental evidence, therefore it is a belief system.""

"Tadeo,      This is a great question that has been considered by great theologians like St. Augustine. The answer lies partly in God's relationship to time. God does not learn things that occur in history. He sees them all in one glance because he is outside time. He is not bound by it, but he is the cause of the existence of all that is bound by time. So in one glance He sees all things and He sees all things in relation to Himself. This pertains to Aristotle's thought thinking self. God knows all things as being caused by Himself. He sees in Himself the cause of all things and sees all things as caused by Him. This entails that all things (such as our prayers) can only be known in the full sense with reference to God who is the cause of our existence while praying and the cause of the very beings about which are prayers are concerned (e.g. our children or parents or friends, etc). This pertains also to His Will because, in seeing all things at once, He does not will things in acts that are temporally distinguished. In the unity of the Divine Will flowing out of the unity of Divine knowledge of all things created, all created things are willed by Him. This unity of the Divine will in the act of creation is an act of Divine Goodness. It is a sharing of HIs goodness with the created order. This is a Trinitarian act because Christ is the Word of God through whom He speaks the world into existence and the Spirit is the love of the Divine Will by which He wills the world from His Goodness.

"Here Augustine teaches that it is not enough to refrain from the sins of wicked men. The Christian must also _criticize them_ for their wickedness, and try to get them to repent of it. To be sure, Augustine goes on to acknowledge that there may be occasions where one might justifiably opt to postpone such criticism until an opportune moment, or refrain from it out of a reasonable fear of doing more harm than good.

"Several new pages are also added to the previous edition’s discussion of divine freedom in the chapter on divine simplicity. (Davies’ views on this issue were the subject of [another post from years ago](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2010/05/davies-on-divine-simplicity-and- freedom.html).) Critics of divine simplicity often argue that it is incompatible with God’s having freely created the universe. For if God could have done other than what he has in fact done, doesn’t that entail that God is changeable, contrary to divine simplicity? And if he is in fact unchangeable or immutable, doesn’t that entail that he could not have done otherwise, and thus created of necessity rather than freely? In response, Davies points out, first, that creating _freely_ simply does not in fact entail _changing_. Certainly it simply begs the question to assume otherwise. For the classical theist, God creates _eternally_ or atemporally, and what is eternal or atemporal does not undergo change. Still, he could have done otherwise than create, so that this eternal act of creation is free.",several new page also added previous discussion divine freedom chapter divine simplicity davy view issue subject another post year agohttpsedwardfeserblogspotcomdavies-on-divine-simplicity-and- freedomhtml critic divine simplicity often argue incompatible freely created universe god could done fact done entail god changeable contrary divine simplicity fact unchangeable immutable entail could done otherwise thus created necessity rather freely response davy point first creating freely simply fact entail changing certainly simply begs question assume otherwise classical theist god creates eternally atemporally eternal atemporal undergo change still could done otherwise create eternal act creation free,feser,1084,0,1167

"A helpful and informative discussion. I will break up my reflection in multiple posts, since what I have to say is too long for a single comment.      One point I see consistently unmentioned in various assessments of Honorius I have read online over the years, though, is the importance of the distinction between formal and material heresy. I do not know when this distinction came to be (ahem) formally recognized in Catholic thought, but I suspect it was after the period of Honorius.      What is significant in this in respect to the later Vatican I's declaration of papal primacy of jurisdiction is that the Pope himself is the final court of appeal. Hence, in many cases someone might not be aware of their heresy, and hold it materially but not formally (insofar as they are not consciously and obstinately asserting a view contrary to the teaching of the Church, as made clear to them by the ecclesial authorities). In other words, it is ultimately up the ecclesial authorities, and ultimately via appeal to the Pope himself, to declare a view heretical.      It seems that it is only at that point that one who continues to hold the problematic view can be definitively called a formal heretic (such would apply earlier, of course, if the person himself acknowledged his view was heretical, but said he did not care, etc.). But in the case of one who does not consider his view heretical, it would require ecclesial judgment, and even this could be overridden by the Pope via appeal. That would be the final say, at least in that Pope's lifetime (another wrinkle in the case of Honorius, on which i'll comment more in a moment).

"Fourth, Davies notes that critics of the doctrine of divine simplicity argue that the doctrine implies that God is identical to his act of creation, and that accordingly, if God exists necessarily, then his act of creation is necessary. But if it is necessary, they conclude, then it cannot be free. In reply, Davies distinguishes between an _act_ considered as something an agent does, and what _results_ from an act, which is external to the agent.

Even better, when the new development is expressed in a way that _manifestly_ connects to and coordinates with the pieces of the prior teachings that it IS meant to alter in some qualified way. It is true development when a Catholic who accepted the old way of saying the teaching can look at the new way and say of it: ""I see that this re-frames the old concepts in a way that introduces a new distinction never made before, and is not so much a _denial_ of the old teaching but a refinement of it.""

"In contrast to this, the realist account see an inextricable link between the formal cause of a thing (which is the species) and the final cause (the pursuit of life via certain acts). In the scholastic dictum agere sequitur esse (to do follows upon to be). So we look at what a thing does and this points back toward what it is (its form). All animals pursue the end of life, but they do so in distinct ways and it is those distinct ways that naturally distinguish the species not some percentage of genetic difference randomly selected by some guy in a lab for no principled reason. After all, people were able to dinstinguish species before the work of Mendel. This does not make the work of Mendel unimportant but it does mean that we need a non nominalistic account of species that is not based on some random overlap of genetic code, but is instead based in principles observable in nature outside the lab. After all, I don't need a geneticist to tell me what a dog is and that it is distinct from a cat. The fact that the classification of species is now the exclusive privelege of geneticists is not an inevitable outworking of some scientific theorem. Instead it results from the imposition of nominalist metaphysics and its account of species onto the whole program.      For those who strictly follow the river forest principle that metaphysics must always follows physics and that the modern sciences are a subset physics (natural philosophy), I would suggest that they pass along this memo to folks like Darwin because he clearly did not receive it. For those in doubt about this, read the work of AC Crombie who was a part of the Pontifical Academy of the Sciences and wrote and magisterial (pardon the irony) three volume work on the modern history of the sciences following his two volume account of the classical and medieval backdrop. In an article summarizing his three volume work, he identifies what he calls various ""styles"" of European scientific thought that are variously influenced by either nominalism or realism.      So, like it or not, metaphysics has influenced the way that the modern sciences have developed and we cannot take on the modern sciences as a metaphysically neutral part of our natural philosophy without it having a potentially negative effect on our metaphysics. Again, those who think that we can are, on this point, naive.      So, a realist metaphysics coupled with scientific facts could approach the origin of the various kinds in order to suggest the relationship between God and the “kinds” or “species” or “forms” of things.

"@Walter   An agent has a range of actions that can be actualized for some given scenario (which provides the common intelligibility for the range of these actions). Since the range considered in itself is indeterminate (and the scenario is indifferent towards any one such action) the agent particularizes out of that range to get an actual action. The particularization itself is sui generis and only exists with some volition itself.      To answer your question more directly, action A and action B are analogous to each other with respect to the scenario in question. If the scenario is for instance that one needs to survive, then the actions ""drink water"" and ""eat food"" can both be said to ensure survival, but in different ways. Since neither of these has commanding power until they are realized, the agent is really open to both.      As such, if you were somehow able to run simulations of this, you would see the agent sometimes ""drink water"", other times ""eat food"".      @RunDec   I think it does, though I will get to what I think is a more core issue that I think you are getting at.      Volitional causation is not univocal. Because it is not univocal, you can have different actions with no intrinsic difference across the agent (until after the action is done). Moreover, ""X"" and ""Y"" do not have any actual individual reality until actually caused.

"That is in fact that main Thomistic-Aristotelian argument for the immateriality of the rational human soul.      Specifically, by virtue of being rational, our intellects are capable of grasping universals with our thoughts, and universals are necessarily eternal and immaterial, transcending any temporal material thing, hence there must be an immaterial and eternal component to our rational intellects.      And that means that the substantial forms (aka the souls) of rational creatures are forms of immaterial and eternal substances, albeit substances with material components that are naturally essential to them but are lost at death. And that in turn fits in nicely with the Christian doctrine of the resurrection of the body.

First, I work as a data scientist/statistician in the field of solid organ transplantation, and I recently learned that living uterus donation is possible. As far as I can tell, the Perverted Faculty Argument (which you lay out in your lecture at Princeton University) would apply to living uterus donation just as it does to contraception, and therefore from a Natural Law perspective (and Catholic perspective) living uterus donation would not be permissible. Is that correct?      Assuming so, I'm thinking about what that implies regarding my role in organ transplantation, and whether it would be wrong of me to engage in research that could promote that practice. In other words, if I were asked to do some kind of analysis regarding living uterus donation, is that proximate enough to the act itself that I should avoid participating in it?

"i would argue that Ockham and Descartes were both an axe at the root of theology, although of course that was not the intention of either. The older understanding could still be seen as having a distinction between primary and secondary causes. However with the rediscovery of Aristotle in the west, the basis of the christian neoplatonic foundation of the past thousand years was slowly lost. In this the primary cause was naturally the divine idea(l)s of things, the eternal form towards which things unfolded in time.

"@ Walter Van den Acker,      ""Please take whatever time you need""      OK, here is a bit more:      I avoid using phrases or concepts like ""all possible worlds"" as confusing or ambiguous and easily giving rise to dispute that can never be resolved, for how can our human minds encompass all possibility, especially if we admit that God must know more about what is possible than we can. I don't mean to claim that talk about all possible worlds does not have its place or cannot be useful. I just like to avoid it when possible, and so I favor ""all imaginable worlds"".      By ""imaginable"" I mean strictly what is limited to normal human imagination, not the ""imagination"" of God, angels, people experiencing the beatific vision, etc. Just people like you and me. It greatly simplifies discussion and simplicity is what we are looking for.      I make a further simplification by saying that our ideas about all imaginable worlds must be communicable to other ordinary people. If it can't be communicated there is not much use in having the idea. It won't get anywhere.      This entails a further restriction, and that is that the communication must be verbal - in words that other people can understand. This could be widened somewhat. For example, ideas could be communicated by images, non verbal sounds, moving imagery, with or without sound, etc. But I hope you do not object to my just restricting it to words alone, again for simplicity. I believe that whatever can be said about communication by words alone can be extended to these other forms of communication.

"Another way to see the incoherence of denying LNC is via the principle that _from a contradiction, anything follows_. Here’s a common way to explain how. Suppose that LNC is false, so that two propositions _p_ and ~ _p_ are both true. Then, by the rule of addition in propositional logic, we can infer from _p_ that either _p_ or _q_ (i.e. _p_ V _q_ ), where _q_ can be any proposition at all (including the proposition _that the denial of LNC is false_ ). By the rule of disjunctive syllogism, _p_ V _q_ and ~ _p_ will then together give us _q_. Hence, from the denial of LNC, you can derive the falsity of the denial of LNC. You will thereby have shown that the skeptic can be refuted from his own premise. Again, skepticism about LNC is incoherent.",another way see incoherence denying lnc via principle contradiction anything follows common way explain suppose lnc false two proposition p p true rule addition propositional logic infer p either p q ie p v q q proposition including proposition denial lnc false rule disjunctive syllogism p v q p together give u q hence denial lnc derive falsity denial lnc thereby shown skeptic refuted premise skepticism lnc incoherent,feser,751,0,1282

"The failing here is in both the intellect and the will. It is in the intellect insofar as this way of dealing with others typically involves the committing of several logical fallacies. For example, there is the _circumstantial ad hominem_ fallacy of pretending to refute what someone says by claiming to identify some suspect motive on his part.  There is the fallacy of _poisoning the well_ , which involves casting aspersions on another’s character rather than addressing his claims or arguments. There is _guilt by association_ , in which one attributes view X to a person who believes Y simply because other people who believe Y have been associated with X. There is the _abusive ad hominem_ , which involves simply flinging a pejorative label at a person (“racist,” “fascist,” “communist,” etc.) as if this sufficed to rebut his claim or argument. And there is what seems to compete with the circumstantial _ad hominem_ for the status of most popular fallacy on social media – the _tu quoque_ , which involves accusing someone of hypocrisy and supposing that one has thereby refuted his claim or argument.",failing intellect intellect insofar way dealing others typically involves committing several logical fallacy example circumstantial ad hominem fallacy pretending refute someone say claiming identify suspect motive part fallacy poisoning well involves casting aspersion character rather addressing claim argument guilt association one attribute view x person belief simply people believe associated x abusive ad hominem involves simply flinging pejorative label person “ racist ” “ fascist ” “ communist ” etc sufficed rebut claim argument seems compete circumstantial ad hominem status popular fallacy social medium – tu quoque involves accusing someone hypocrisy supposing one thereby refuted claim argument,feser,1111,0,1288
"Tom,   If you change weight are you still you? Do you ""retain your identifying properties"" when a gram of water evaporates from your skin?      Indeed, are you precisely the same at all moment to moment? Clearly, no.      Is one apple precisely the same as another apple? Of course not, so, in that case, what sense does it make to count apples, since no two apples are precisely the same?      The identification of a sort of thing is always a bit fuzzy, so we approximate to classify and consider certain sorts of objects to be members of a set when their ""identifying properties"" fall within some range established by convention.      In chemistry the convention is that the number of protons in the nucleus determines which element the atom is called. Atoms of the same sort can vary over a wide variety of parameters, even the number of neutrons in the nucleus, and they are still called, by convention, a particular element name.      Hylomorphism: stuff can change but stuff can only change into stuff that it can change to and it can't change to stuff it can't change to. This is what Thomists consider some grand profound insight?      Such trivial, tautological truths are what remain of A-T in modern science. Oh yes, and Aristotle observed that stuff moves, so did Aquinas, so in that respect, yes, modern science has confirmed A-T.      However, the rest of A-T is bunk because Aristotle got the fundamentals wrong. The primary argument for a first mover is unsound because Aristotle was fundamentally wrong about motion (change). That argument is also logically invalid as an argument for god, very clearly because Aquinas abandoned valid logic in the last sentence.",tom change weight still retain identifying property gram water evaporates skin indeed precisely moment moment clearly one apple precisely another apple course case sense make count apple since two apple precisely identification sort thing always bit fuzzy approximate classify consider certain sort object member set identifying property fall within range established convention chemistry convention number proton nucleus determines element atom called atom sort vary wide variety parameter even number neutron nucleus still called convention particular element name hylomorphism stuff change stuff change stuff change change stuff change thomists consider grand profound insight trivial tautological truth remain a-t modern science oh yes aristotle observed stuff move aquinas respect yes modern science confirmed a-t however rest a-t bunk aristotle got fundamental wrong primary argument first mover unsound aristotle fundamentally wrong motion change argument also logically invalid argument god clearly aquinas abandoned valid logic last sentence,feser,1680,0,1289

"The Holy Spirit guides the Church in various _different_ ways, and the differences are not trivial. For example: regarding the Bible, the Catholic understanding is that the Holy Spirit ""guided"" each human writer so that the human writer did not make mistakes in what he was asserting. Also, that guidance meant the human writer did not ""leave out"" anything the Holy Spirit wanted included. But at the same time, the human writer did **really** use his own mind and heart to craft the _telling_ of the individual episodes, and to craft the interweaving of themes and principles, so as to _convey his own thought_ as well as to convey what the Holy Spirit intended be conveyed.      In a different way, God inspired various prophets to convey God's _very own words_ , at certain times: the prophets were merely **repeating** what God said to them, mere mouthpieces for God's chosen words. The prophet had no hand in ""crafting"" anything about these transmissions. While at other times the prophets were speaking _in their own voice_ to warn of errors and such.      In a lesser way: God steps in to _protect from (outright) error_ when an ecumenical council defines a dogma: God _does not_ guarantee that the dogma so defined is stated in the clearest and best manner in which it can be stated. God is not the direct author of the words chosen to define the dogma, and the resulting definition might end up unclear or ambiguous with respect to some point.      God also _protects_ the entire teaching body of the bishops, but NOT in such a way that each bishop is protected from error. Rather, God's action is indirect, so that _overall_ , and over enough time, the entire body of the teachings will point in the direction of the truth, but included in that large body of teaching will be individual components of erroneous teaching.      God oversees the election of popes not so as to direct the cardinals to select the man that is best fit to lead the Church, but in a minimalist way - God only guarantees this much: the pope chosen will not cause the ultimate destruction of the Church. He might do grave damage to her in the meantime. The cardinals might pick a real stinker of a bishop to be pope, and God's oversight need not prevent this.      The express rules governing the election of the pope make it clear that the cardinals CAN do things that are manifestly _wrong_ in their behavior in the consistory, including this: they are able to vote not for the man they believe is the best choice, but for someone else, whom they want _for other reasons_ than that he would be the best choice. They are able to (wrongly) extort votes via promises, and while this would be gravely sinful, the votes would still be real and valid. There are any number of ways a cardinal could vote against his conscience, and some ways the whole college could end up voting for a truly awful pope.",holy spirit guide church various different way difference trivial example regarding bible catholic understanding holy spirit guided human writer human writer make mistake asserting also guidance meant human writer leave anything holy spirit wanted included time human writer really use mind heart craft telling individual episode craft interweaving theme principle convey thought well convey holy spirit intended conveyed different way god inspired various prophet convey word certain time prophet merely repeating god said mere mouthpiece chosen word prophet hand crafting anything transmission time prophet speaking voice warn error lesser way god step protect outright error ecumenical council defines dogma god guarantee dogma defined stated clearest best manner stated god direct author word chosen define dogma resulting definition might end unclear ambiguous respect point god also protects entire teaching body bishop way bishop protected error rather action indirect overall enough time entire body teaching point direction truth included large body teaching individual component erroneous teaching god oversees election pope direct cardinal select man best fit lead church minimalist way - god guarantee much pope chosen cause ultimate destruction church might grave damage meantime cardinal might pick real stinker bishop pope oversight need prevent express rule governing election pope make clear cardinal thing manifestly wrong behavior consistory including able vote man believe best choice someone else want reason would best choice able wrongly extort vote via promise would gravely sinful vote would still real valid number way cardinal could vote conscience way whole college could end voting truly awful pope,feser,2882,0,1291

"Nice post Prof Feser!   I concur with almost everything.   I do think that Dubia should have been cleared!   However I think that the case for the Latin Mass would do well if it were to be presented without the purpose of ""appeasing traditionalists"" because it tends to create the image of being held to ransome and traditionalists being traditionalists ought to know better then that. Being in the appeasing business of liberals or traditionalists usually doesn't go well. And a case should be evaluated on its merits.   Pope Benedict XVI always referred to the latin mass as one of the treasures of the Church, I think a very strong argument could be formed on the basis of that it self. And ultimately it should not be restricted is my opinion.   There are some criticisms not of the mass it self but with the circumstances surrounding it. Many right wingers try to frame it as a right wing issue when in fact it absolutely is not and many people of even neutral political persuasions love the latin mass and it's beauty.   Attempts by some traditionalists to campaign against Mass in other languages also doesn't help. Lots of efforts were taken in many areas with regards to translations and words in order to remain true to the substance of the Eucharistic celebration. An example being my mother tongue Konkani. Some people prefer to be able to properly understand the meaning of what is being celebrated so that they can focus and concentrate their mind. And there is also the risk of being swayed or distracted if you don't understand.   I think that one should take the criticisms of Arch Bishop Di Noia on this point seriously. He is also one of the most respected theologians in recent times renowned for his orthodoxy.   I also concur completely with all of Cardinal Pell's points.

"(continued from previous post)      So, in the case of Honorius, we see this distinction between formal and material heresy is not made, and the question of whether it could have been formally heretical is challenged by the fact that in his own lifetime (at least while holding the Chair), Honorius himself would have been the final court of appeal. Assuredly he would not have taken his own view to be heretical. So right there there seems to be a strong reason to declare he was at least not a FORMAL heretic. But this takes us to the question of the authority of FUTURE councils and Popes. Many questions arise.      First, it seems to me that while current popes have primacy of jurisdiction, and infallibility in ex cathedra teaching, their juridical judgments are not infallible (leaving aside the issue of the infallibility of canonizations of saints). But of course, in their time no one would have the authority to ignore or override a Pope's juridical judgment. Vatican I makes this much clear. BUT, could such a person still believe, privately or publicly, that a current pope's judgment was wrong, even while admitting that neither he (that person himself) nor anyone other than the Pope could juridically do anything about this? It seems this would be the case, though it would also be within the Pope's power to discipline such a person.      So, it does seem possible that a Pope could wrongly judge that someone was not in heresy, or that the person was heretical, but juridically that judgment would still have to be honored, since the current Pope would have the final say in such matters.

"""It's that there is no good reason to believe something exists for which there is no evidence.""      Well, now Mr. Jindra, why don't you tell us what counts as evidence and how you arrived at the conclusion that your proposal is true. What I suspect you mean by evidence is ""empircally verifiable"". In other words, it has to be something that you can see to count as evidence. Or put in the terms of the debate it has to be material to count as evidence. So for someone to show you that the immaterial exists, you need them to show it to you in material form. Well that makes about as much sense as you standing behind the podium doing the macarena, now doesn't it.      In philosophy 101 and basic logic, students learn that this is called ""begging the question"". You are assuming the very thing that needs to be proven and you are requiring that this assumption also be taken by others as the only means to show you that it is not true. Oh what a wicked web we weave.      So the assertion that ""knowledge requires empirical verification"" is itself *not verifiable by its own criteria*.

"@Anonymous, Schmid’s first paper is actually an explication of Mullins’ critique of simplicity via God’s inability to create without a reason. Mullins appears to think authoritatively on the workings of the divine mind. But, he knows or should know that the very term _rational_ is an extremely limited label to describe something analogous to God. Schmid explains:       _God’s act of will is based on that self-same intrinsic goodness that is identical to God. This seems to be a far cry from a reason for creating, let alone a reason for creating this particular universe (as opposed to some other possible universe)._      This just strikes me as odd. Schmid and Mullins seem to argue that God’s reasoning in some way parallels ours, but we have not the slightest clue how the mind of God works. If the arguments for divine impassibility are successful, then God is impassible regardless our inability to figure out how simplicity can be maintained when we consider creation. If the DDI is false, then arguments should be provided to show the inferential mistakes therein.      Moreover, Mullins’ “proposals” are nothing but finite attempts at figuring out how creation is compatible with “reason.” And since Mullins cannot come up with a good reason for creation, DDI (the doctrine of divine impassibility) must be false. But this of course does not follow. It’s akin to arguments for the logical Problem of Evil. The fact that we cannot figure out a good reason for evil does not mean that one doesn’t exist. So long as it is logically possible that there is a morally justifiable reason for allowing evil, then evil cannot be used as evidence against God. And this also works the other way with transcendental arguments for God. The fact that God is the best explanation for rationality does not mean, in itself, that God exists. Spontaneous generation was at one the time the “best” explanation for the appearance of worms in rotting meat, but we discovered that it was neither best nor true. Thus, our apparent inability to come up with a reason for creation that is consistent with DDI does not mean that one doesn’t exist. Mullins should stick with attacking the arguments for DDI instead of engaging in vain attempts at understanding the divine mind.      I realize that this smacks of unprincipled mysterianism, but it’s just the opposite. An unsuccessful argument cannot be held together by an appeal to mystery. That would be unprincipled. But if an argument is sound, we cannot reasonably discard it based on our inability to figure out some of its consequences. For example, I believe the arguments for _creatio ex nihilo_ are convincing, but I don’t have a sweet clue how God did it. There are times when I find it an interesting mental exercise, but at the end of the road I’m always baffled. That doesn’t shake my confidence in the legitimacy of the argument; it just shows the limitation of my knowledge. Finite minds cannot comprehend an infinite mind, so it’s pointless to try. Likewise, I’m perfectly happy with the mystery of creation because the arguments for simplicity are solid.

"It is clear enough why a Jewish audience of the day would be scandalized by the doctrine. A commitment to God’s unicity and absolute distinctness from the creation had been cemented into the psychology of the people of Israel over the course of centuries, as a long series of prophets and divine punishments gradually purged the nation of any vestige of idolatry. The claim that there are three Persons in the one God, and that one of them took on flesh and died on a cross, was therefore bound to be shocking. But these ideas would not have been properly understood if they were _not_ shocking. If God is one, how can he be tripersonal? If he is the creator of the material world, how could he take on flesh? It was essential that the Jewish people, the first recipients of the Gospel, understood that however these doctrines are to be spelled out, they are _not_ to be interpreted in terms of the idea that the God of Israel is merely part of some pantheon of corporeal deities – as they very easily would have been interpreted had a horror of idolatry not taken deep root among the Jewish people by the first century AD.

"Vincent,   Jaegwon Kim, a prominent physicalist working on the mind-body problem concedes that the default position of human societies is not physicalism but dualism: “Something like this dualism of personhood, I believe, is common lore shared across most cultures and religious traditions.” (Mind in a Physical World: An Essay on the Mind-Body Problem and Mental Causation; Cambridge: MIT Press, 2000). Charles Taliaferro lists Michael Levin, Daniel Dennett, David Lewis, Thomas Nagel, J. J. C. Smart, Richard Rorty, Donald Davidson, and Colin McGinn as other non-dualist scholars working in philosophy of mind who concede that some commonsense view of dualism is held by the overwhelming number of humankind now and throughout history. Children are dualists. As Henry Wellman puts it, the recent findings of developmental psychology show that ""young children are dualists: knowledgeable of mental states and entities as ontologically different from physical objects"" (The Child's Theory of Mind; Cambridge: MIT Press, 1990). The presumption follows that Ancient Israel, like other ancient societies, would have held this commonsense dualism unless one can find evidence otherwise. What the Christian who claims that the Hebrew Bible advocates physicalism over dualism needs are arguments in the Hebrew Bible countering the prevailing assumption by ancient peoples of a basic dualism. There are none. The Hellenization thesis, as applied to physicalism, is a complete dud. Instead, basic dualism is at least the operating principle of the Hebrew Bible. And as bad as the position of Nancey Murphey, Brian Rosner, Paul Althaus and other Christian physicalists is, at least they are not global physicalists, i.e. they acknowledge that God is not composed of waves and limited to the speed of light.

"When related to quantum mechanics it makes no sense to speak decently of the parts and the whole while doing the economy to really understand what the difference between pure and mixed states is: which, actually, is what leads to the deep understanding of the Bell’s inequalities.   It is also meaningless to talk about Aristotelian forms if we tend to interpret them like “shapes” having measurable extensions and movements: potency is, per definition, not actual and cannot be described in terms of measurements. But potency is real, like QM shows, and the interaction of a quantum system with an instrument can be perfectly described in term of measurements.   To understand that a potency is not localized in any point of space and time till it interacts with an instrument, we can give the ideal example of a bridge long 300’000 km, one quality of the bridge is to be breakable, the measurement of this property will consist in trying to break that bridge, if the measurement is successful that bridge will be broken in whatever point, then we will not have a breakable bridge but a broken bridge, i.e. the actual state of the bridge will bridge will change from breakable into broken and this concern the whole bridge, independently from it length and independently from the time needed for the information to be shared at both ends of the bridge: whatever will be measured at that time is simply the fact that that bridge is broken.   There is a paradigm that twists the mind of too many people, even physicists, when thinking about a physical system: in the Aristotelian world as well as in the Quantum world which just need two assumption to perfectly define a physical system, namely the fact that (a) for each physical state it exists another which is orthogonal to itself and (b) that movement consists in loosing some properties (which become orthogonal) while getting other which were potentially accessible; in the Newtonian/classical physics there is a third assumption which is claimed, but unnecessary in Quantum and Aristotelian physics, which is the fact that one requires (c) that the result of an experience must be either actual or potential.   The fact that there is no need of (c) in the “daily’s everybody’s physics” like the Aristotelian one as well as in the Quantum one, shows that there is unity of being and logic and little solution of continuity between both interpretative bodies.

"First, the reason a council condemns someone as a heretic is because of his _teaching_. Hence it is, first and foremost, Honorius’s _teaching_ that was condemned. That means that the _teaching_ was judged heretical. But whether a _teaching_ is heretical _is_ a doctrinal matter, and not a mere historical matter. Now, given that a papally-approved council cannot err on doctrinal matters, it follows that the councils in question infallibly judged that Honorius’s teaching was heretical (whatever his intentions). But since anyone who teaches heresy is a heretic, it follows (at least given that Honorius really did write the letters that got him into trouble, as most of his defenders concede) that these councils _did_ after all infallibly judge that Honorius was a heretic.",first reason council condemns someone heretic teaching hence first foremost teaching condemned mean teaching judged heretical whether teaching heretical doctrinal matter mere historical matter given papally-approved council can not err doctrinal matter follows council question infallibly judged teaching heretical whatever intention since anyone teach heresy heretic follows least given honorius really write letter got trouble defender concede council infallibly judge honorius heretic,feser,776,0,1336

"@Tony      I just saw this comment or I would have responded sooner. There is some misunderstanding about the point that I am making. I did not make the assertion that their existence is necessary. That is true only of God. What I am referring to is what St. Augustine and St. Thomas would refer to as ""natural necessity"". St. Thomas held that properties are inextricably linked to natures. It is for this reason that you cannot have a triangle that has four sides. In the same way, you cannot have an angel that is not immortal. Given what they are (their essence), they must be immortal. To be an angel is to have this property. If you don't have this property, you are not an angel. Again, this is called natural necessity. Said differently, given that God wills something to be, it has certain properties by nature of what it is. It was only nominalism that denied this.      Now, reading more of your post, you deny the point that I am making and in doing so you are out of company with those who affirm the existence of natural necessity. It was the nominalist, voluntarist emphasis on the will of God as ""all powerful"" that eliminated natural necessity because nominalism did not hold that things have natures (in the realist sense) to anchor such necessity. Another way of stating the realist position is to say that God wills an angel to be immortal precisely by willing it to be an angel. This does not in any way undermine God's preservation of the being of angels. In one act of the Divine Will, He both wills them to be angels and eternally wills for their unending existence. To say that God could choose for the angel to not exist is to say that He could contradict His own will which is absurd.

"(final segment--see previous 3 posts from me)      So, taking all of these points together, we are left to wonder if anyone can be declared FORMALLY heretical posthumously (at least in a case where there is no evidence they were judged heretical and obstinately persisted in their views). This then raises the question as to whether one can, and/or should, be anathematized posthumously at all. This has obviously occurred, presumably also in cases other than that of Honorius, so it certainly can happen. BUT, what we do not have in Honorius's case is a judgment that he was FORMALLY heretical (a distinction I suspect was not fully formulated or conceived at the time of Council condemning him). And once this distinction between formal and material heresy is made, we must face more squarely whether it is appropriate, or even possible, to condemn someone who is not formally heretical (as it seems Honorius could not have been). Prior to this distinction being made, we can likely forgive such anathemas, but it seems this distinction now affects how such judgments can be made (and perhaps even how we assess anathemas given before the material/formal distinction was fully developed).      In any case, we see that it was only a future pope and council who passed these judgments about a previous pope. At the very least, this should give great pause to anyone not in such authority to presume too definitely that anything a current or previous pope did was heretical. But this is especially true if one goes down the path of implying formal heresy, as for a current pope that would ultimately require the judgment of the Pope himself, and would be questionable if even a current Pope could do that in respect to a previous Pope (see above). I realize Feser is not arguing otherwise, but I suspect some who read this might apply what he says to current situations and neglect to appreciate the limits the points I raise place on such assessments. (And, we might add, such people could never have it seems even more than an opinion, though perhaps a well informed one, that a current pope held even a materially heretical view, since the judgment of heresy would ultimately fall to the Pope himself).      All this said, to reiterate a previous key point, in respect to Honorius, we can ask whether the current distinction between formal and material heresy would preclude anathemas like those against Honorius from taking place today. And, we may even ask whether the authority of a current pope would permit qualifying, or perhaps even removing, the judgment against Honorius in later councils, depending upon the extent to which one determines juridical declarations of councils (bearing in mind juridical decisions do not seem to be infallible, even if in their time they are authoritative), are or are not components of magisterial tradition which oblige agreement with current judgments, papal or otherwise.

"To: Norm, September 19, 2022 at 7:08 AM   You say, ""Professor Feser's work and overall approach and commentary, to me atleast, exemplifies some of the most sophisticated philosophical treatments that one can find ..."" I'm happy for you to have found something that makes some sense of meaning for you. But such a discovery is limited in application because it can only be defined within the context for which you were searching. In other words, it is largely sensible but only within a Catholic perspective, and is believed within a very limited audience. By far, the operant context at orders of magnitude so much greater, is that which is outside the Catholic framework. Catholic thought, catholic philosophy (Thomism), to be sure, is part of the mix but it is waning, particularly in the West over the past 100 years. There are many reasons for this, not the least of which is the ever-increasing and robust challenge and demand for Catholicism to prove its bona fides as the central social platform on which the West should be consolidated going forward. I am more that sure that that challenge has already been lost. It's in the numbers of numerous surveys throughout the past decades that Catholicism, as a creditable (let alone credible) framework around which today's diverse and multi-cultural   communities can coalesce, bind and organise, has reached its use-by date.      We, as a community, must be mindful that Catholicism plays a bit part in today's world. That is not to say it has no role in contemporary society. But those that wish to live by the Catholic dictate are free to do so and are welcomed to do so, as least to me. Proselytising, however is not a good look nor appreciated in the public square as it makes for discomforting relationships with the wider neighbourhood.      You say you are pro-life and pro-traditional marriage. To suggest that they are normative moral beliefs based on embryology and sociology, is factually wrong. The scientific, sociological, anthropological, physiological, psychological and psychiatric research has clearly shown us that the male- female differentiation is fundamentally and significantly more nuanced than the somewhat risibly simplistic binary definition that seems to inform your notion of what constitutes a boy and what a girl. But I am heartened by your comment: ""But obviously through the democratic process, if the majority of the people happen to disagree with me and vote accordingly, I will respect that outcome and perhaps adopt a more grass roots approach to change that out come through the democratic approach.""   I say the jury is already out on these, and the community has collectively spoken, throughout the Western world least.      No. You don't disappoint me. We have more in common than you think.

My intentions have no prior cause; I just have them, and that's all. So too with God.""      Gratuitously asserted...?      And God said, ""Let there be..."" But, per Vincent, first, 'logically' speaking, he formed (quite _un_ intentionally, apparently!) a prior intention/plan that he would say ""Let there be..."" -- and to be clear, he didn't need to form a _prior_ prior intention (a second-order prior intention) in order form the aforementioned prior intention, because 'logically' (Vincent says) one must form intentions _before acting_ ; and so clearly forming an intention/making a plan is not itself an action; otherwise one would always have to form an(other) intention before forming any intention, so that it would be impossible to ever get started forming an intention/making a plan.

"@ StardustyPsyche      In Newtonian mechanics, energy is proportional to the square of momentum. Energy is a far more complicated notion then momentum and the conservation of energy as a principle came long after Newton. It must be constantly revised to account for new findings. Leibniz understood the conservation of kinetic and potential mechanical energy but that was only the beginning and he didn't call it energy. Meanwhile, Aristotle had said the equivalent of ""Energy is a condition that describes the capacity to do work"". That's not bad for someone the Aristotle denouncers always misunderstand and denounce as an illogical step on their illogical denunciation of Aquinas.      There was no speed limit in Newtonian mechanics and Aristotle's supposed worry that a prime mover acting forever on an object could move it to a speed that in the infinite limit was infinite is in no way inconsistent with Newtonian mechanics.      If you would understand what I've tried twice already using the discovery that neutrinos have mass, you would also understand that the speed of light as an absolute speed limit is also not inconsistent with this so-called worry of Aristotle's. Perhaps it would have been simpler to point out that in Einstein's relativity, space intervals in the direction of motion grow smaller proper to the object in relative motion and become 0 in the infinite limit so that an object with 0 rest mass covers any space interval in 0 proper time, corresponding to infinite speed in spacetime events separated by finite time and space in a frame in which objects with non zero rest mass (that's you and me) are at rest. The 0 space limit that an object acted upon by the prime mover forever would measure in its tangent bundle spacetime manifold (inertial reference frame in curved spacetime) is completely consistent with Aristotle's supposed ""worry"".      I have pointed out that Aristotle did not forecast modern relativity, but that this supposed worry is completely CONSISTENT with it. This is the same as that understanding that a ball dropped from a building will fall to the ground is not the modern science of gravity but is completely CONSISTENT with it.      What happens with an individual object is not what happens with a manifold of spacetime events in Einstein's relativity. The development in time of such a manifold is not predicted by relativity because position and momentum (or time and energy) are not precisely definable at any single spacetime event, so the whole manifold of spacetime events is not predicted, uncertainty growing in the time coordinate from any defined manifold of spacetime events at a particular time (events separated by 0 interval) on that manifold.      This you do not seem to understand or want to understand.      ""Russell found that scarcely a sentence [that Aristotle and the ancient philosophers] wrote was correct.""      Ha-ha.

"The application to the present day is obvious. Consider the sexual sins into which our age has, arguably, sunk more deeply than any previous one.

"The ""God Hypothesis"" is just another Ultimate Why question, which Paul Edwards addressed many years ago in a Intro to Phil textbook      ""Regarding our second issue, cosmic why questions, Edwards begins by considering what he calls “the theological why.” The theological answer to the theological why posits that a god answers the question of meaning. Major difficulties here include how we could say anything intelligible about such disembodied minds, as well as all of the other difficulties involved with justifying such beliefs. Edwards focuses particularly on whether the theological answer really answers the question, mentioning a number of philosophers in this regard: “Schopenhauer referred to all such attempts to reach a final resting place in the series of causes as treating the causal principle like a ‘hired cab’ which one dismisses when one has reached one’s destination. Bertrand Russell objects that such writers work with an obscure and objectionable notion of explanation: to explain something, we are not at all required to introduce a “self-sufficient” entity, whatever that may be…Nagel insists that it is perfectly legitimate to inquire into the reasons for the existence of the alleged absolute Being…”[ii] Thus, the theological answer appears to be one of convenience that does not fully answer our query; rather, it stops the inquiry by asking no more why questions.      Edwards differentiates the theological why question—are there gods and do they provide the ultimate explanation?—from what he calls the “super-ultimate why.” A person posing this latter question regards the theological answer as not going far enough because it does not answer questions such as “Why are there gods at all?” or “Why is there anything at all?” or “Why does everything that is, exist?” The theological answer simply puts an end to why questions arbitrarily; it stops short of pushing the question to its ultimate end. One might respond that it is obsessive to continually ask why questions, but most reflective persons do ask “Why does anything or everything exist?” suggesting that the question is basic to thoughtful persons. Of course, it may be that we just don’t know the answer to this ultimate mystery—all we can say is that the existence of anything is a mystery, its ultimate explanation remaining always beyond us.      According to Edwards, while some philosophers take the ultimate why question seriously many others argue that it is meaningless. The reason for this is that if a question cannot in principle be answered, as so many philosophers claim about this super ultimate why question, then that question is meaningless. Critics of this view agree that the question is radically different from all others but disagree that it is meaningless. They respond that ordinarily, questions must in principle be capable of being answered to be meaningful, but not in the case of this ultimate question. Yet if a question really cannot be answered, and if all possible answers have been ruled out a priori, is that not the very definition of a meaningless question?      Another way of arriving at the conclusion that the question “why does everything exist?” is meaningless, is to consider how when we ordinarily ask “why x?” we assume the answer is something other than x. But in the case of “why anything at all?” it is not possible to find something outside of everything to explain everything. So meaningful why questions are those which are about anything in the set of all things, but if our why question is about something other than everything, then why has lost its meaning because it is logically impossible to have an answer.""

"On a relevant but distinct sidenote, I have noticed that Thomists occasionally treat ID as a whipping boy without understanding it. I don't think that this has occurred here, but I have seen Thomists who act as though the the ID movement is a Protestant thing because it somehow involves the denial of secondary causality. If this were true, it is hard to explain why important Catholic philosophers like Ben Wiker or Catholic thinkers from CUA like Jay Richards would be involved with it. In fact, I know that this is not true because one of the very reasons that I converted from Protestantism to Catholicism in the wake of my graduate study at Wheaton was because I recognized the truth and profundity of secondary causality and how this accounted for the Catholic account of cooperation with grace. I seen nothing within ID that necessarily excludes this sort of causality even if it does not explicitly appeal to it. I have also seen a professed Thomist dialogue with Dr. Behe (a fellow Catholic and a biologist who wrote Darwin's Black Box) and even written about his work and it is obvious from the exchange that this person did not take the time to understand what Behe was saying.      This brings me back to my point above. I don't think it is fruitful to discourage the good that is done by ID (or is the suggestion that *no good* is done?) by criticizing it for not getting us all the way to Classical Theism or a link way the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. What it does do for many is get them away from a thorough going secular, materialist worldview. Dr. Behe has had many folks tell him that his work saved their faith in God. Now if scholastic demonstrations get them further, that need not cause us to criticize ID for also moving them away from materialism and atheism and toward theism. Although the critique in the post above is a critique of Meyer's work (or the suggestion made by the title of his work), I think the same principle is applicable.",relevant distinct sidenote noticed thomists occasionally treat id whipping boy without understanding think occurred seen thomists act though id movement protestant thing somehow involves denial secondary causality true hard explain important catholic philosopher like ben wiker catholic thinker cua like jay richards would involved fact know true one reason converted protestantism catholicism wake graduate study wheaton recognized truth profundity secondary causality accounted catholic account cooperation grace seen nothing within id necessarily excludes sort causality even explicitly appeal also seen professed thomist dialogue dr behe fellow catholic biologist wrote black box even written work obvious exchange person take time understand behe saying brings back point think fruitful discourage good done id suggestion good done criticizing getting u way classical theism link way god abraham isaac jacob many get away thorough going secular materialist worldview dr behe many folk tell work saved faith god scholastic demonstration get need cause u criticize id also moving away materialism atheism toward theism although critique post critique work suggestion made title work think principle applicable,feser,1972,0,1390

"@ Walter Van den Acker,      ""Obviously God only had to obey your logic.""      That is nothing like what I said.      ""I don't avoid challenge,, but real challenge requires real arguments, and I don't see any from you.""      You do avoid challenge and you avoid mine because you can't answer it.      You would first have to understand the consequences of the bitwise XOR operation between a bitwise random sequence and an intelligible sequence. I will start with finite sequences and we can think of them as displayed on a computer screen under some standard protocol that displays sequences of bits as words on a computer screen, or at least it does if the sequence of bits are not such that what is displayed is nonsense. Now I can get a random sequence with 50/50 bits by a physical process. It could actually display as something intelligible but it is not likely.      Let us call this random sequence A. Let us call B an actually intelligible sequence. It consists of meaningful words converted into a sequence of bits so that they will display as the meaningful words when displayed under the standard protocol being used.      It can easily be shown that when a third sequence, C, is created by doing the operation A XOR B -> C, that C is as random as A and is as unlikely as A to display as anything meaningful.      Now, the beginning of a system:      It can also easily be shown that A, B, and C, together, have the property such that any two of them produce the third sequence when the bitwise XOR operation is performed on the other two. Thus:      A XOR B -> C,   B XOR C -> A, and   C XOR A -> B.      As stated above as easily demonstrated, if A is random, then so is C. But we began with a random A and then chose B to be intelligible, so if we XOR the two random sequences (""disordered"" is a better word here than ""random"", but for now I stick with ""random""), we get the intelligible sequence that we purposely chose. Now here is the crux of the beginning of the system:      The random sequence A that we began with cannot, by itself, give us the chosen sequence B. A is random after all. It could have been any similarly random sequence, so if any random sequence could be decoded into the chosen sequence, how could it be decoded into a different chosen sequence had a different one been chosen? If there was some process dependent upon the chosen sequence by which any random sequence could be decoded into the particular chosen sequence, then the chosen sequence would already have to be known before the correct process that works could be used. So the random sequence A cannot have, intrinsic to itself, the information thatispecifies the chosen sequence. Furthermore, since the second random sequence was produced using the XOR operation with the chosen sequence and the chosen sequence could have been _any_ intelligible sequence, we have that a second random sequence C exists for any initial random A and chosen B. For random A there exists a random C that gives B, the intelligible sequence, no matter what intelligible sequence Biwas chosen.      By just guessing at what C happens to be, A XOR C is most likely nonsense, but if it results in an intelligible B, it is very unlikely to be the pre-chosen B. It is in fact as likely as correctly guessing the pre-chosen B from all possible intelligible sequences (this is slightly simplified for clarity).      This is the beginning of a system based on simplicity that will show that God does not have to be ruled by the logic that you, Walter, futilely use to try to impose your own ideas as limits on God.

"Walter,      ""The whole point of LFW is that the will is not determined. LFW does not mean you can have no will that determines your choice.   It doesn't matter where that will came from, it there is a will, then my argument goes through.   If you will vanilla ice (for whatever reason), then, unless something happens to prevent this choice you have vanilla ice and not chocolate ice.""      How on earth can I choose what to eat, then? The picture you described is literally my will - completely outside of my control - determining my choice to either get vanilla or chocolate depending on some property arising in it - and you suggest that the causal origin of that property is irrelevant for whether we are libertarian free or not! That it doesn't matter where it came from. So in your model I can - with no control over it, no choice over it - just get a ""will"" to have vanilla ice and this will make me get vanilla ice instead of chocolate (unless something happens to prevent it, again something over which I presumably have no control over since all my actions would just follow upon another will arising, and it wouldn't matter where that will came from, according to you).   In what world is that libertarian freedom? That is just people being determined by a will over which they have no control. I don't think any LFW proponent would agree with that model; certainly I think most LFW theorists would agree with me. And then you just refuse to elaborate on the potential regress of the origins of the ""will"" and how, in your model, it cannot arise by the choice of the agent (since you must refuse that A at t in S can cause either X or ~X).   I am surprised that you think this would count as LFW.      I take it as essential that in LFW *we* are the ones making our choices, in an indeterministic but non-stochastic way; that we cause our actions and do so in such a way that, when we're deliberating, we can really cause one or the other at that moment, and thus under the same set of intrinsic properties.      I say we can reach an agreement and a common conclusion here: you and I have radically different ideas of LFW. So if someone accepts your model, then indeed they will have a problem with God's choice in DS. If someone subscribes to your model of LFW, then that objection to DS is a serious one, and perhaps there is no way around it.      But if someone accepts my model of LFW (or, even more modestly, accepts my model as metaphysically possible) instead, then the problem disappears. Because in my model, the agent can cause either X or ~X without requiring a difference in intrinsic properties for choosing one or the other. It's not unique to God, it's the same for humans, too.      So if someone accepts your model of libertarian freedom (call it LFW1) then the objection is very much alive. Well done. But if someone prefers my model (call it LFW2) instead, the objection isn't really impressive.

God is not, in such cases, the cause of cardinals' sins in choosing a bad man. And in that sense, at least, God does not WANT them to sin by making such choices. God might even be interiorly _urging_ them to choose a good man, but they ignore or reject His urging. If God is urging a cardinal to vote for X, and the cardinal rejects that urging and votes for Y, it is (at best) only under a very constrained and qualified sense that ""God wants"" Y to be pope.

"Kerry:      I meant 0, not -1. Fixed. Thanks!      And by by ""increasing"" I meant ""non-strictly"". I.e., ""non-decreasing"".      Andrew:      The symmetry assumption is natural, but not inevitable. Here is one way to construct proper accuracy scoring rules. You are going to be given a choice between a number of different games, each of which has an outcome that depends on the proposition q. You choose the game with the highest expected outcome according to your probability you assigned to q. Your score then is the actual outcome of the game. (You can get different scoring rules for different tie- breaking procedures for equal expected outcomes.) This kind of a scoring rule tends not to satisfy the symmetry condition. For instance, suppose you have a choice between two games, one which pays $1 on q and $2 on ~q and one which pays $3 on q and $1 on ~q. Let p be your probability of q. Then you will choose game 1 if p is less than 1/3 and game 2 if p is more than 1/3. Then T(p)=1 if p<1/3 and T(p)=3 if p>1/3, while F(p)=2 if p<1/3 and F(p)=1 if p>1/3. (And what we have at 1/3 depends on the tie-breaking choice.) Then we don't have your symmetry condition.      Another family of cases of asymmetry is like this. If there is objective morality (or God or a lawlike universe, etc.), there is a lot of value in being nearly certain that there is objective morality (etc.) But if there is no objective morality (or no God or no lawlike universe, etc.), there is little value in being nearly certain of that.",kerry meant - fixed thanks increasing meant non-strictly ie non-decreasing andrew symmetry assumption natural inevitable one way construct proper accuracy scoring rule going given choice number different game outcome depends proposition q choose game highest expected outcome according probability assigned q score actual outcome game get different scoring rule different tie- breaking procedure equal expected outcome kind scoring rule tends satisfy symmetry condition instance suppose choice two game one pay q q one pay q q let p probability q choose game p le game p tp p tp p fp p fp p depends tie-breaking choice symmetry condition another family case asymmetry like objective morality god lawlike universe etc lot value nearly certain objective morality etc objective morality god lawlike universe etc little value nearly certain,pruss,1515,1,1418

"For these reasons, I prefer to use the more general and less potentially misleading term “error” when discussing the case of Honorius, as I did in the title of my previous post.

"It turns out that, just as the content of theoretical concepts outstrips what can be captured in an operational definition, so too, more generally, does it outstrip what is observable. The content of concepts is given instead by the axioms of the theory in which they are embedded. But the problem now, as Cartwright notes, is that such axioms are never sufficient to determine exactly what it is in the empirical world a theory is _about_. Consider, again, the equation _F_ = _ma_. Considered just by itself, it tells us nothing more than that one quantity is equal to the product of two others. And as Cartwright observes, this is true not only of the force, mass, and acceleration of a material object, but also of the area of a rectangle with respect to the length of its sides. There is nothing in the equation _itself_ that tells us which of these is its subject matter. Of course, we could add further items to our set of axioms, such as Newton’s law of universal gravitation. But no matter how many we add, there will always be alternative possible interpretations.",turn content theoretical concept outstrips captured operational definition generally outstrip observable content concept given instead axiom theory embedded problem cartwright note axiom never sufficient determine exactly empirical world theory consider equation f considered tell u nothing one quantity equal product two others cartwright observes true force mass acceleration material object also area rectangle respect length side nothing equation tell u subject matter course could add item set axiom law universal gravitation matter many add always alternative possible interpretation,feser,1073,0,1427

"It leads to a LOT of confusion. Many people think that classical theists are denying the personhood of God and are therefore positing that he is impersonal. Another problem is that personalism is itself a school of philosophy, Karol Wojtyla for instance was a defender of thomistic personalism.      And the main charges against divine simplicity aren't that it makes God ""insufficiently personal"", but that it makes God incoherent, a property, that it leads to problems with contingency, knowledge, and more.

"@Laudator Temporis Acti      That other fallible humans have a subjective certainty Y, that contradicts a subjective certainty X belonging to my own fallible self, is no proof that X could not be recognised by me as objectively valid. (As with the colour of Fluffy the cat in my previous post) it's only a problem if all I knew about X and Y were that they were beliefs belonging to this or that person.      If all the knowledge that we had access to was that 'I believe X, you believe Y', then since we are all fallible, there would be no grounds for preferring X over Y in regard to their objective certainty.      But the presupposition that all the knowledge to which we have access is of the form 'I believe X, you believe Y', is a type of philosophical idealism: 'All we can directly know is the fact that something is someone's belief - we cannot have direct knowledge of evidence for these beliefs in themselves, whereby we can discriminate which are true and which are false.'      But we do not grant this unproven idealist presupposition (which furthermore is contradicted by our very experience of having direct awareness of evidence); and so we are not led to the relativist conclusion.      In short, we are not reduced to saying, 'Fallible person A says X, fallible person B says Y - who knows?' Each fallible individual can turn to the actual evidence, by which valid objective certainties can be established in particular cases - even if in other particular cases, someone (myself or others) fails to properly examine the evidence, and so actualizes in those particular cases the abstract possibility of falling into error.      I agree that my background and life history makes it more likely for me to have ended up a Catholic than e.g. a Hindu. But that proves nothing. My background also makes it more likely that I will have a valid objective certainty of Pythagoras' Theorem, than if I had been born in 3000 BC. For every individual, particular contingent circumstances channel us into a position where we are more favourably placed than we otherwise would have been to discover objective evidence for this or that truth. That does not invalidate our objective certainty of those truths, once we have seen the evidence. Again the principle: we must examine the actual evidence regarding X (not matters about our background that are logically irrelevant to the truth or falsity of X).      And just on a couple of your other points:      I can agree for the sake of argument that Newman's example regarding the trustworthiness of John or Richard is for our purposes the least satisfactory of his examples, since the nature of the 'evidence' for their trustworthiness raises all sorts of other questions. (His example is nonetheless perhaps a useful corrective against modelling our understanding of certainty primarily on our experience of mathematical certainty, rather than on e.g. certainties that occur in interpersonal relationships.)      And the passive infallibility (according to Catholic teaching) of the whole Body of the Faithful guided by the Holy Spirit, has no bearing on the topic of an admittedly fallible individual, Catholic or not, coming to a valid objective certainty in a particular case, by rationally examining evidence.

"It seems to me that before Vatican I, the Church was well aware of the matter of teachings that were binding _in some strong sense_ even without a dogmatic decree by a Council. One of the indicators of this is, expressly, the Church's willingness to categorize someone as ""a heretic"" (and not just condemn their teaching) on the basis of not merely that their idea is erroneous, but that _they should have KNOWN better_ , and thus their holding such ideas is _morally_ faulty as well as intellectually faulty. Certainly, the fact that something had been already _taught universally by the Fathers_ was considered sufficient evidence of its bona fides, without either a council or a papal declaration, and indeed its unanimous affirmation by the Fathers _was USED by the Councils_ as the basis for their dogmatic definitions. But at the same time, there were many other teachings that were neither dogmatically defined, nor contested / disputed, that were simply _passed along_ from generation to generation as being ""what had been taught"" and everybody assented to them and nobody got worked up about whether they were held definitively and irreformably or just, you know, the ordinary teachings of the Church.

"(1) It is not the case that the two particles are in the correct bottom-up configuration from the start, and that our ignorance about this configuration is solely due to the fact that we have not yet performed the necessary measurements (this is the perspective of Newtonian deterministic physics). (2) In quantum mechanics, once produced, the two particles do not have an objectively defined ""actual"" configuration, but rather possess the objective ""potentiality"" to express one of the two possible configurations when measured. An apparent paradox arises only if we try to consider the two particles as being independent from each other after their production, because, in this case, once we measure the state of one of them, due to Einsteinian Relativity, there is no way that the result obtained by the measurement apparatus becomes instantly known by the other one which is now at a certain distance so that also this one can change its potential quantic state into a value which would be coherent with the one expressed by the particle measured first. (3) The apparent paradox comes from wanting to apply Newtonian categories, like determinism, to a Reality which, like in Aristotelian physics, does not need them in order to be fully operational. E.g., wanting to conceive the production of these particles as being the one of two actual particles is a gratuitous claim which comes from nowhere but is only supported by a too narrow Newtonian paradigm. (4) Instead of that, if you accept what is called non-locality and contextuality (exactly like we do accept it for the notion of potentiality in Aristotelian physics) then there is no paradox at all and entanglement becomes something ordinary we all experience everyday (I gave somewhere else the example of measuring the ""breakability"", which is a potentiality, of a bridge, ""breakability"" which is non-local and very much contextual and when that measurement happens, by breaking or not said bridge, this involves immediately the whole bridge independently from its length and the distance between its two opposite entrances)",case two particle correct bottom-up configuration start ignorance configuration solely due fact yet performed necessary measurement perspective newtonian deterministic physic quantum mechanic produced two particle objectively defined actual configuration rather posse objective potentiality express one two possible configuration measured apparent paradox arises try consider two particle independent production case measure state one due einsteinian relativity way result obtained measurement apparatus becomes instantly known one certain distance also one change potential quantic state value would coherent one expressed particle measured first apparent paradox come wanting apply newtonian category like determinism reality like aristotelian physic need order fully operational eg wanting conceive production particle one two actual particle gratuitous claim come nowhere supported narrow newtonian paradigm instead accept called non-locality contextuality exactly like accept notion potentiality aristotelian physic paradox entanglement becomes something ordinary experience everyday gave somewhere else example measuring breakability potentiality bridge breakability non-local much contextual measurement happens breaking said bridge involves immediately whole bridge independently length distance two opposite entrance,feser,2087,0,1457

"Dr. Feser, thank you for a solid post on suffering.      A few of the comments above have brought up the problem of ""animal pain."" While I understand the standard response to that to be something along the lines of ""necessity justified in view of the perfection of creation,"" I'm wondering if there is not a richer answer hidden in the back of our tradition. Specificly, I'm wondering about the role of angels in all this.      Think of something like Tolkien's cosmology - physical evil and disorder entered into creation when the principalities and powers of the world (The Valar and Maiar) entered into conflict with each other, one desiring to fullfill the creators plan to make a habitation for the ""children of illuvitar"" (rational life), and others, out to make a dominion for themselves. As proper ""sub-creators,"" God, in his secondary causality, had given spiritual beings the duties of care and creation in the physical world, and the flaws, imperfections, and downright violence of creation were due to the infidelity of some of the powers intrusted to their care. If we hold the standard line that fallen angels fell in the first instant of their creation, and, further, that they had been, nevertheless, been given dominion over certain parts or aspects of creation, then Johanine language about the ""lord of this world,"" and Pauline language about the ""princes of the powers of the air,"" makes a lot more sense, and can even be joined to an evolutionary cosmology.      The universe is an odd place, and the creation of the conditions for life, let alone rational life, in an odd, (physically fallen?) cosmos could be seen as the fruit of angelic conquest over malign forces. Furthermore, evolution itself might be seen as being helped along or guided by forces trying to bring about God's will in creation.

"@ Tadeo,      ""So, in fact, what they are saying is that we are just an aggregate! And that sounds odd.""      Yes, it does.      ""If they were in fact the 'individuals' (the cells or whatever), why come together to form an 'illusion' of one (human being)? That doesn't seem right.""      It doesn't.      I believe that our existence was purposely orchestrated by God and that science cannot prove or disprove it, because randomness is far simpler than anything science can attain to. Science tries to simplify and does simplify prima facie discrete data, but the simplification into statements is as far as it can go. A statement obviously has a specific order. It is not random and cannot be further compressed and retain intelligibility. A random process could have come up with the statement or, far more likely, gibberish.      This is not in any way anti-scientific.      To put it in terms, not of statements, but of the actual result in the physical environment, the theory based on random mutation and natural selection does not have in it a pointer to which of the almost unimaginably large number of results today that it could have led to.      Something with purpose chose the result by undetectably choosing the results of the ""dice rolls"", the choices hidden in what is only random to human intellect.      That something was God.

"As per the two examples, ""creating Western Orthodoxies"" refers to tendencies which aim to change ecclesiastical structure completely. I think these tendencies have nothing in common with the Opus Dei and the Saint Pius X Society, which have absolutely no wish to revolutionize the Church. Peter Kwasniewski, to broaden the example, evidently does not seem to think the Pope can reform the Roman Liturgy at all. This is to be seen in his articles opposing pre-Novus Ordo reforms going back to Leo XIII and beyond.      Several ""lights"" of traditionalism are of the opinion that the broad Church (where is this ideal Church now?) is a better guarantor of liturgical and doctrinal fidelity than Rome - even though the rite has always been whatever the Pope legislated. This goes against the Catholic spirit entirely and such views properly amount to ""Latin Rite Orthodoxy"", but one that wants to remain within the Church. Just like the German bishops!      This has nothing to do with not following liturgical reforms that have very harmful effects for the faith, or questioning certain texts of Vatican II as they have officially been interpreted thus far. Obviously the Novus Ordo is a departure from former norms and a plaything of liturgists imbued with notions from the '60s. It was resisted, with good reason, by Archbishop Lefebvre.

"In [a recent post](http://alexanderpruss.blogspot.com/2023/01/knowing-you- will-soon-have-enough.html), I noted that it is possible to cook up a Bayesian setup where you don’t meet some threshold, say for belief or knowledge, with respect to some proposition, but you do meet the same threshold with respect to the claim that after you examine a piece of evidence, then you _will_ meet the threshold. This is counterintuitive: it seems to imply that you can know that you will have enough evidence to know something even though you don’t yet. In a comment, Ian noted that one way out of this is to say that beliefs do not correspond to sharp credences. It then occurred to me that one could use the setup to probe the question of how sharp our credences are and what the thresholds for things like belief and knowledge are, perhaps complementarily to the considerations in [this paper](https://philarchive.org/rec/PRUBSA).",recent posthttpalexanderprussblogspotcomknowing-you- will-soon-have-enoughhtml noted possible cook bayesian setup meet threshold say belief knowledge respect proposition meet threshold respect claim examine piece evidence meet threshold counterintuitive seems imply know enough evidence know something even though yet comment ian noted one way say belief correspond sharp credence occurred one could use setup probe question sharp credence threshold thing like belief knowledge perhaps complementarily consideration paperhttpsphilarchiveorgrecprubsa,pruss,922,1,1496

"The closest Walford gets to a papal remark that might seem to support his case is Pope Innocent III’s statement that “the Lord clearly intimates that Peter’s successors will never at any time deviate from the Catholic faith.” But Walford himself immediately goes on to admit that it cannot literally be the case that popes “will _never at any time_ ” teach error, and cites the famous example of the medieval pope John XXII’s having taught error vis-à-vis the particular judgment. Walford emphasizes that John held these erroneous views in his capacity as a private theologian (though it is important to note that John did express them publicly in sermons). What matters for present purposes, though, is that by Walford’s own admission, Pope Innocent’s remark needs qualification.  Now, as already noted, the standard qualification would be that popes can err when neither speaking _ex cathedra_ nor, in their ordinary magisterium, merely reiterating teaching already independently known to be infallible. And Walford gives no argument for qualifying it in some other way.",closest walford get papal remark might seem support case pope innocent statement “ the lord clearly intimate successor never time deviate catholic faith ” walford immediately go admit can not literally case pope “ will never time ” teach error cite famous example medieval pope john taught error vis-à-vis particular judgment walford emphasizes john held erroneous view capacity private theologian though important note john express publicly sermon matter present purpose though admission pope remark need qualification already noted standard qualification would pope err neither speaking ex cathedra ordinary magisterium merely reiterating teaching already independently known infallible walford give argument qualifying way,feser,1072,0,1499
"I agree that these two positions are distinct and should be kept apart for the purpose of recognizing whether either one is contrary to _what the Church teaches_. Von Balthasar's position is much less easy to attack as contrary, or as clearly and explicitly contrary.      But whether salvation for all it is something that we can ""reasonably"" hope for is not the same as whether it is clearly and explicitly contrary to what the Church teaches. Some teachings make it imprudent, unwise, or temerarious (rash) to propose, without being definitely opposed to Church teaching, because the Church teaching strongly **leans** in a certain direction without (yet) being _definitive_ about it. For example, the Holy Office stated over 100 years ago that it MAY NOT safely be taught that Christ in his human intellect did not have the knowledge of those in Beatitude during his period on Earth, nor even that the position be held as debatable or uncertain.      In addition to the (many) biblical passages that _at least point toward_ the result that some are damned, there are some passages whose import are (and have been taken traditionally as saying) that some are _in fact_ damned, rather than that some may be damned. And whether they have been ""traditionally"" taught so, versus ""Traditionally"" taught so, i.e. whether the weight of the apostolic and Fathers teachings' comes down definitively on one side of that, I hesitate to say, but then again perhaps _so should everyone else_. It may be **rash** to say (and teach) that all may be saved is a reasonable hope.      Nevertheless, one may certainly PRAY for all, in the sense of (a) having good will toward all; and (b) asking God to offer his favor to all; so that (c) all who _might be saved_ will indeed be saved. While your benevolence applies to all in that **any one** might be saved, and thus of any one you hope he be saved, it need not encompass an active hope that _every_ single one be saved. This benevolence (and it's consequent form of prayer) is an appropriate expression of charity, being clearly assimilable to God's _antecedent_ will that all be saved.",agree two position distinct kept apart purpose recognizing whether either one contrary church teach von position much le easy attack contrary clearly explicitly contrary whether salvation something reasonably hope whether clearly explicitly contrary church teach teaching make imprudent unwise temerarious rash propose without definitely opposed church teaching church teaching strongly lean certain direction without yet definitive example holy office stated year ago may safely taught christ human intellect knowledge beatitude period earth even position held debatable uncertain addition many biblical passage least point toward result damned passage whose import taken traditionally saying fact damned rather may damned whether traditionally taught versus traditionally taught ie whether weight apostolic father come definitively one side hesitate say perhaps everyone else may rash say teach may saved reasonable hope nevertheless one may certainly pray sense good toward b asking god offer favor c might saved indeed saved benevolence applies one might saved thus one hope saved need encompass active hope every single one saved benevolence consequent form prayer appropriate expression charity clearly assimilable antecedent saved,feser,2123,0,1500
"""If the tree of life was necessary for Adam and Eve to live forever, one might reasonably ask, did animals have access to the tree of life? The answer seems to be no.      If the tree of life was unique, it might have been enough for Adam and Eve to eat from, but it would never have been enough for all of the animals of the world to eat from. This may be another sign that the animals were not understood to have the tree of life for their food. If so, then the text of Genesis itself would suggest that, while man was meant to be immortal, animals were not. That would support the idea, based on St. Paul’s statement, that it was human death that entered the world through the Fall, not animal death.      Furthermore, we should note that giving “every green plant” to animals as food does not mean that some of them weren’t also carnivores. It’s not as if, before original sin, lions ate dandelions and toadstools and only afterward did they begin picking on poor old wildebeest. This is something Thomas Aquinas wrote about in his Summa Theologica:      In the opinion of some, those animals which now are fierce and kill others, would, in that state, have been tame, not only in regard to man, but also in regard to other animals. But this is quite unreasonable. For the nature of animals was not changed by man’s sin, as if those whose nature now it is to devour the flesh of others, would then have lived on herbs, as the lion and falcon.      (We should add, lest anyone be tempted to think that this is a forced retreat in the face of modern evolutionary theory, that Thomas wrote these words nearly 550 years prior to the birth of Charles Darwin.)""",tree life necessary adam eve live forever one might reasonably ask animal access tree life answer seems tree life unique might enough adam eve eat would never enough animal world eat may another sign animal understood tree life food text genesis would suggest man meant immortal animal would support idea based st statement human death entered world fall animal death furthermore note giving “ every green plant ” animal food mean also carnivore original sin lion ate dandelion toadstool afterward begin picking poor old wildebeest something thomas aquinas wrote summa theologica opinion animal fierce kill others would state tame regard man also regard animal quite unreasonable nature animal changed sin whose nature devour flesh others would lived herb lion falcon add lest anyone tempted think forced retreat face modern evolutionary theory thomas wrote word nearly year prior birth charles darwin,feser,1659,0,1501

"Then there is the fact that the Third Council of Constantinople condemned Honorius. Here too Bellarmine suggests that one strategy to defend Honorius would be to propose that the relevant passages from the council proceedings were faked, and inserted by enemies of Rome. But the council proceedings elsewhere _praise_ Rome and other popes, so what sense would this have made? Alternatively, Bellarmine suggests, perhaps the council really did condemn Honorius, but did so under the mistaken assumption that he was a heretic. This is not a problem, Bellarmine says, because a council can be mistaken about a historical (as opposed to doctrinal) matter. But even if the council had been mistaken about Honorius, in condemning him it was teaching that popes can (when not speaking _ex cathedra_ ) be guilty of heresy, and _that is_ a doctrinal matter.

"@ Walter Van den Acker,      Original sin was the fall of creation and suffering was the consequence of this fall. We are all in this fallen creation. No one is being ""punished"", not even Adam and Eve. They just inevitably chose sin given free will and time. Human free will can also be modelled by an infinite unbiased random binary sequence so all choices exist in it somewhere (as simple a model as you are likely to find). Adam and Eve, in time, chose to leave temporal paradise and enter the fallen creation. Knowledge of good and evil meant a return to temporal paradise was gone without the intervention of God to bring them to the new creation, the eternal (outside of time) paradise with God.      This is where we are, all of us, people, babies, good people, bad people, dogs, ticks, mosquitos, and viruses. There is only one creation (simplicity again). We are all in it together. God did not cause multiple worlds for each to choose, and by the choice define right and wrong (for you are the one claiming to redefine things, not me). As a human with an infinite component to your mind, since you are free, you can always choose your own way to stay separate from God. In eternity (outside of time), when the new creation replaces this one, choosing will no longer be possible, so if you have elected to be separate from God, you will stay separate from God.      The world we live in is not so by necessity. It could have been anything (modelled by the random sequence). It could have been a world in which 1+ 1 is 3 and the rules of logic could have been anything. But the world we live in is the way it is because of love. Love, not necessity. Love is why after inevitably (given endless time) exiting temporal paradise, there is still Salvation if you freely choose it.

"It is well-known that the Catholic Church teaches that popes are infallible when they speak _ex cathedra_ or exercise their extraordinary magisterium. What that means is that if a pope formally presents some teaching in a manner intended to be definitive and absolutely binding, he is prevented by divine assistance from falling into error. The ordinary magisterium of the Church, and the pope when exercising it, are also infallible when they simply reiterate some doctrine that has been consistently taught for centuries.

"I think you are missing Feser’s point in completely the opposite direction. He is obviously not arguing that the fault in the atomist’s logic is not reducing fat enough, but rather their entire notion that everything is reducible to the colorless, tasteless, heatless objects is off from the start. And he has provided a myriad of arguments for this in other locations.      You are therefore missing Feser’s point again when you say that he is not reducing fat enough when he considers water more fundamental that it’s constituent elements. None of this entails a denial of science, chemistry, or physics by the way, and I think Feser would argue the opposite. The only way to make sense of the scientific process and discoveries of modern science is if our sense aren’t wrong. And the sense in which water is more fundamental has to do more with intentionality, and how these parts ultimately serve the purpose of the greater whole.      Lastly, to your point that quantum mechanics has problems, that doesn’t entail that quantum hylomorphism is right. Well, you are correct, but I think again missing part of the point. There could be alternative correct interpretations, but this book is what is making the argument for quantum hylomorphism in detail. Feser is just reviewing the book in a few paragraphs. Also, I think the more important takeaway is that the problems with quantum mechanics are in its interpretation, as opposed to us missing the exact value of mass of some subatomic particle. The fact that we have no satisfactory interpretation for a scientific process we know with certainty to be at least partially mathematically correct (measurement problem) is good reason to consider other kinds of philosophical viewpoints. And the point Feser is making is that, unsurprisingly, the Aristotelian view of matter seems to fit what we observe in the quantum realm. I can’t speak to exactly how much I agree with this, as I am neither a PhD physicist or thomist philosopher, but I don’t think it’s a good counter argument to merely say, you just haven’t reduced far enough, the senses are mere illusions.

"""I think that for true, positive compulsion one would indeed need to posit some lack because creating, logically, seems to be an actual condition of God's perfection, something it depends on""      Perhaps. But this is very vague to me. A being that is so perfectly good that heis just naturally (necessarily) making good things does not strike me as absurd, and the good things it makes would still be dependent upon him - and not he dependent upon them. The good things just follows as a necessary consequence from the perfectly good being, because that's what a perfectly good being is: it makes good things.      Again, it seems intelligible to me, and compatible with what Leibniz thought; Pseudo-Dionysius; the Neoplatonists; and so on. Personally I do not know that it should be rejected. What you said, again, strikes me as vague. The point remains that it's a controversial issue that requires a lot of argument, instead of just mentioning that God is pure actuality. Some classical theists have thought (and some continue to think) creation is necessary.      Also, if someone does not accept libertarian freedom in any way, they just can't avoid the fact that creation would be necessary (or perhaps random). Not my case, since I accept LFW; but it is conceivable that someone could both be a classical theist and reject LFW and as such be a necessitarian classical theist.",think true positive compulsion one would indeed need posit lack creating logically seems actual condition perfection something depends perhaps vague perfectly good heis naturally necessarily making good thing strike absurd good thing make would still dependent upon - dependent upon good thing follows necessary consequence perfectly good perfectly good make good thing seems intelligible compatible leibniz thought pseudo-dionysius neoplatonist personally know rejected said strike vague point remains controversial issue requires lot argument instead mentioning god pure actuality classical theist thought continue think creation necessary also someone accept libertarian freedom way avoid fact creation would necessary perhaps random case since accept lfw conceivable someone could classical theist reject lfw necessitarian classical theist,feser,1383,0,1525

"In Dr. Feser's twitter account there was a response to the original tweets that I think captures what seems to me a very obvious problem with this criticism of Meyer. Jonathan wrote: ""I don’t think the point of these arguments is to make God contingent, but to argue for his existence probabilistically. I don’t see an issue with arguing for a metaphysically necessary being with abduction."" To object to this is to say that a contingent argument necessarily entails that the being argued for is contingent. That seems to me quite obviously false. It is the argument that is being characterized as contingent and this does not tell us that the being argued for is either contingent or necessary.      Dr. Feser responded to this tweet saying: ""I know they don't intend to make God contingent. But if an argument leaves it even possible that the world might exist apart from X, then to establish X isn't to establish God (Note that that doesn't entail that X is not God, but only that the arg doesn't establish that X is God)"" My response to this is that their aim is not to ""establish"" God (i.e. the God of Classical Theism who is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob). ID folks are very explicit about this. Their goal is not a scholastic demonstration. After all their arguments are contingent and proceed by way of abduction following the work of Pierce. That this approach does not get us all the way to classical theism and the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob seems to me no grounds for criticizing it as though it accomplishes nothing.      This appears to me like an older brother who is an exceptional and developed artist criticizing his younger brother for making initial efforts at art because those efforts are not as precise and clear. What would be the point of such an attack? It would certainly seem to me unnecessarily discouraging to the younger brother especially when the two approaches are not mutually exclusive.      The point I am making is consistent with Wuellner's definition: ""a conditional or provisional explanation of observed facts or of their connection with each other"". This can be taken in two ways. It can either entail that the existence of the thing that explains the phenomena is contingent and that its relationship to the thing caused is contingent *OR* it could mean that the explanation qua explanation is contingent (i.e. a contingent argument). Is it not entirely consistent with classical theism to recognize the latter possibility with abduction? It is not obvious to me why not.      It seems that Dr. Feser's answer to this is that an abductive approach can only show causal links that are themselves contingent (""because the causal relationship between them, even if real, is going to be contingent."") It is not clear to me why Dr. Feser thinks it is the case that contingent arguments entail that the being argued for is itself contingent and this seems to me to get at the crux of the issue.",dr twitter account response original tweet think capture seems obvious problem criticism meyer jonathan wrote think point argument make god contingent argue existence probabilistically see issue arguing metaphysically necessary abduction object say contingent argument necessarily entail argued contingent seems quite obviously false argument characterized contingent tell u argued either contingent necessary dr feser responded tweet saying know intend make god contingent argument leaf even possible world might exist apart x establish x establish god note entail x god arg establish x god response aim establish god ie god classical theism god abraham isaac jacob id folk explicit goal scholastic demonstration argument contingent proceed way abduction following work pierce approach get u way classical theism god abraham isaac jacob seems ground criticizing though accomplishes nothing appears like older brother exceptional developed artist criticizing younger brother making initial effort art effort precise clear would point attack would certainly seem unnecessarily discouraging younger brother especially two approach mutually exclusive point making consistent definition conditional provisional explanation observed fact connection taken two way either entail existence thing explains phenomenon contingent relationship thing caused contingent could mean explanation qua explanation contingent ie contingent argument entirely consistent classical theism recognize latter possibility abduction obvious seems dr answer abductive approach show causal link contingent causal relationship even real going contingent clear dr feser think case contingent argument entail argued contingent seems get crux issue,feser,2945,0,1535

"@Simon      Good point there, we do accept suffering a lot. I just suppose that Walter would reply, that on these cases we would have the goods while not suffering anything, which is a acceptable view to the non-christian.      @Walter      I see what you are saying. Just a correction: on the view i'am defending God is beyond what we usually mean by good, for He has no essence separate from His essence that He must be a great exemplar of, but is THE good that we all recept a fraction, you could say. It is not a case of the voluntaristic view were God chooses things to be good for no reason so i dont see much circularity. The name ""good"" that we use to Him mean only that He has no lack, but it has little to do with our virtues.      Now, could this Being, beyond our good but also its cause, choose something that we would not choose? I would say that we just cant know much of this answer a priori. Since God has no nature that we can separate from Him and say ""His nature is to choose such and such"" them there is a sense were, while He can by no means be evil*, He is sure hard to predict.      Notice that the monotheistic-or-close pagans, that had no Bible, normally did not really treat God as much similar to us. This because pure reason cant really show much of how He thinks, only that He cant be bad(and what i mentioned below).

"Where the study of consciousness is concerned, recent philosophy of mind has followed David Chalmers in distinguishing between “easy problems” and the “hard problem.” Identifying the neural correlates of various kinds of conscious awareness would be examples of an easy problem. By characterizing such a problem as “easy,” Chalmers doesn’t mean that it is trivial, or even easy in every respect. He just means that it is the sort of problem the solution to which seems clearly attainable using existing methods and standard scientific and philosophical assumptions. The “hard problem” is explaining why any of the neural processes in question are associated with conscious awareness, given that it seems at least prima facie possible that they could do what neuroscience describes them as doing in the complete absence of consciousness. (This is alleged to be shown by arguments like Chalmers’ [“zombie argument,”](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2013/12/zombies- shoppers-guide.html) along with other influential arguments like Frank Jackson’s [“knowledge argument”](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2010/07/when-frank-jilted- mary.html) and [Thomas Nagel’s argument](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2012/04/reading-rosenberg- part-x.html) in his famous article “What is it Like to Be a Bat?”)",study consciousness concerned recent philosophy mind followed david chalmers distinguishing “ easy problem ” “ hard problem ” identifying neural correlate various kind conscious awareness would example easy problem characterizing problem “ easy ” chalmers mean trivial even easy every respect mean sort problem solution seems clearly attainable using existing method standard scientific philosophical assumption “ hard problem ” explaining neural process question associated conscious awareness given seems least prima facie possible could neuroscience describes complete absence consciousness alleged shown argument like “ zombie argument ” httpsedwardfeserblogspotcomzombies- shoppers-guidehtml along influential argument like frank “ knowledge argument ” httpsedwardfeserblogspotcomwhen-frank-jilted- maryhtml thomas argumenthttpsedwardfeserblogspotcomreading-rosenberg- part-xhtml famous article “ what like bat ”,feser,1296,0,1546

Michael Miller, _The Shepherd and the Rock: Origins, Development, and Mission of the Papacy_ , at p. 292). Now, to sin against the faith would be to teach error on some matter of faith or morals.

"Hi Ed,      I respectfully put it to you that the Thomistic doctrine of Divine simplicity you're defending here has passed its use-by date, for the following reasons:      1\. It isn't taught by the Church, which merely affirms that God has “one essence, substance, or nature absolutely simple” (Lateran IV, 1215). There's nothing here about whether God has contingent thoughts, plans or intentions in his capacity as Creator of the cosmos, in addition to possessing a nature which is necessary.      2\. It's totally unscriptural. The Bible depicts God as explicitly declaring, ""My thoughts [plural] are not your thoughts"" (Isaiah 55:8), in a verse affirming Divine transcendence (which is the last place where one would expect anthropomorphic language, so I can only assume it's literal). The Psalmist adds: ""How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How vast is the sum of them!"" (Psalm 139:17). Thomists, on the other hand, believe that God does not have multiple thoughts; instead, He has only one thought, viz., His thought of Himself, and He knows creatures by knowing Himself.      3\. It's grounded in a philosophically dubious ontology: creatures are said to be compounds of essence and existence, while God alone is an Act of Pure and Infinite Existence, which is incapable of possessing any modifications or attributes (such as thoughts and intentions). However, the arguments for a real distinction between essence and existence in creatures prove no such thing: all they prove is that matter and form are distinct (which is why I can know what a Thylacine [or Tasmanian tiger] is, without knowing whether it currently exists or not: I don't know for sure if its form is still instantiated anywhere on Earth). What's more, the notion of Pure Existence is utterly vague: it is indefinite rather than infinite. Better to say, rather, that God is the Ultimate Yardstick of existence. He defines what it means for us to exist, for ""in him we live, and move, and have our being"" (Acts 17:28).      4\. Thomists also contend that God, the Author of nature, could have made a different world, or no world at all, without having any different mental acts, such as intentions. That's like an author saying, “I could have written a totally different story, or even no story at all, without there being any difference in my intentions.”      5\. Why is there a world? The Thomist’s answer is: “Because God.” But if there were a different world, or no world at all, the Thomist's reply would be the same: ""Because God."" I respectfully submit that any explanation which is elastic enough to account for BOTH the world’s occurrence AND its non- occurrence is not doing the work of an explanation at all.

"¡¡¡Cavete!!!   What on earth is going on! Am I the only one to notice this?!   Under the cover of ""upstanding"" right wing politics, various authors are promoting occultism, while spouting edifying Christian vocab left right and centre.      Here's one example. Michael Warren Davis has done the rounds about Catholic places, having been published quite a bit - in First Things, Crisis Magazine, the Catholic Herald. He is out and about elsewhere too - in The Imaginative Conservative, where he declares he can only slightly disagree (on an issue of art and beauty) with the late Roger Scruton. He recommends Scruton's work ""On Hunting"" as ""an account of tradition from the living heart of that tradition"". The living heart of Idealism, more likely! This is the work that defines God as ""the subjectivity of the world""!      This is not what concerned me the most (I've mentioned it here before, but almost nobody seemed to think it of much interest - no doubt they were too busy reading the ST to notice).      Davis has authored a couple of articles at The American Conservative that are extremely dangerous to politicised Catholic conservatives. One of them ""When Witchcraft was Right-Wing"", depicts the witch Gerard Gardner and his followers as typically right wing. Davis doesn't defend devilry, but the article is bizarrely non-committal on this issue. Davis only gets a little emotional when pointing out how modern leftist witches are not true successors of Gardner!      His most recent article in TAC (""War Against the Modern World) definitely joined the dots. It is a shameless defence of ""Traditionalism"", well-known for occultism and virulent anti-Christianity in all its forms.. The only criticism he allows is that Evola is not so nice because Mussolini and Dugin like him, so Evola - bad. But Guenon - good! And looney tunes King Charles loves Guenon, so he's great too. Steve Bannon is somewhere between Guenon and Evola, so Davis says he ain't perfect.      These ""Traditionalists"" are now producing such volumes of material that those with doubts - real Thomists included, must feel it is useless to respond. It shouldn't be so difficult. After all, the dressing up of esoteric ideas with religious imagery is not new. Though Jonathan Pageau's defence of the Kabbala, and the occult, if only as a ""concept"" or aspect of ""Christianity"" was really going a bit far, even for one of ""them"".      The minds of well-meaning readers, including Catholics, need to be warned about Davis and authors like him.

In terms of power, it is non sense to ask why God did not make contingently good beings who are also necessarily good. Again, this is like asking why God did not make a square circle.

If they were, they would be God (which is another contradiction). That is, they would be uncreated created beings. You have baked absurdities into your account of God's power, human and angelic freedom, and God's justice. However, those absurdities do not touch upon thinkers like St. Thomas, but rather stem from your own imagination and misunderstandings.      Regarding justice, you have not even taken the trouble to define the term, but are just slapping the title ""unjust"" on particular examples without allowing yourself to be nailed down to a definition. This allows you to maneuver manipulatively around your elastic terms and accusations against the justice and power of God.

Remember that later pagans and ancient and medieval christians took effort to argue against the gnostic view that the material world is bad because of the inevitable corruption and decay its existence creates, which seems alive on today antinatalists, so the view i'am defending does argue that even beings that can and do suffer and die are good.

The converse is true with the writings of those who haven't the slightest grip on reality (including Buddhists). One of Kant's friends had to stop reading his work because he felt he was going crazy. If the philosophy makes a person less sane, this is a good cue that it is neither good nor true. I hope to say more about this when there is time.

THToD:      Like you and Alston, I am inclined to agree that ""belief"" is at best an awkward way to describe God's cognition. However, I think a major part of the reason why God doesn't fundamentally have beliefs is that there is no room for a gap in God between cognition and reality. Whether an open theist can have the ""no gap"" view of God depends on the variety of open theism. If the open theist is an open futurist, who thinks there are no facts in reality about future contingents, then they can have the ""no gap"" view. But an open theist like Swinburne or van Inwagen who thinks there are facts about future contingents and God doesn't know them thinks there is a gap between God's knowledge and reality, and now God is sounding very much like us -- there is stuff that God is uncertain about.",ian somewhat inclined say high credence belief thtod like alston inclined agree belief best awkward way describe cognition however think major part reason god fundamentally belief room gap god cognition reality whether open theist gap view god depends variety open theism open theist open futurist think fact reality future contingent gap view open theist like swinburne van inwagen think fact future contingent god know think gap knowledge reality god sounding much like u -- stuff god uncertain,pruss,894,1,1594

"@Alex I think an important nuance here is that in this specific view of participation, goodness-by-participation isn't actually **true or intrinsic** goodness. But this is problematic because we do have other verses affirming the true goodness of creatures, such as Genesis 1 explicitly affirms this, as does 1 Timothy 4 (first four verses on marriage & food) and Matthew 10 (sparrows).      The main problem would be that this view of participationism _wouldn't just make it impossible_ to take pride or ""brag"" about something we did (which I can concede is wrong), but that it also makes it impossible to actually say we are good or have value as well. In the **same manner & for the same reasons** we can't take pride in or brag about our actions, we also can't affirm we are **good,** or have being, and this seems to be a big problem with that specific account.      And it's also important to point out that Scripture often uses **hyperbolic negation** or hyperbolic merism - God for example in Jeremiah 7:22 apparently denies He ever commanded the Hebrews to do sacrifice, yet that's not a literal negation but a hyperbolic one to point out that loving God is more important - rhetorically DENYING one thing to point out the greater importance of another, without intending to truly deny the importance of the secondary. Same thing with loving Christ & hating one's parents - intentionally hyperbolic contrasts that actually convey a hierarchy of love, but not pure exclusivity.      So basing a very specific view of participationism (because not all models of participationism would agree that we aren't actually truly good) on a phrase that is likely using intentional rhetorical hyperbole is more speculative than solid.",alex think important nuance specific view participation goodness-by-participation actually true intrinsic goodness problematic verse affirming true goodness creature genesis explicitly affirms timothy first four verse marriage food matthew sparrow main problem would view participationism make impossible take pride brag something concede wrong also make impossible actually say good value well manner reason take pride brag action also affirm good seems big problem specific account also important point scripture often us hyperbolic negation hyperbolic merism - god example jeremiah apparently denies ever commanded hebrew sacrifice yet literal negation hyperbolic one point loving god important - rhetorically denying one thing point greater importance another without intending truly deny importance secondary thing loving christ hating parent - intentionally hyperbolic contrast actually convey hierarchy love pure exclusivity basing specific view participationism model participationism would agree actually truly good phrase likely using intentional rhetorical hyperbole speculative solid,pruss,1731,1,1599

"I've been reading through the complete works of C. S. Lewis for the past 7-8 months. (Reading through his works by genre). When I got to his non-fiction ""popular works"" (such as Mere Christianity, Miracles, etc.), I was surprised that his descriptions of God sound similar to the Classical Theist understanding of God. (At least in some cases). Below are a few quotes from Lewis's books (possibly) showing this.      For each quote, the name of the book (and chapter) comes first.      In this first quote when Lewis uses the word ""Dualism"" he means ""Cosmic Dualism"" (the belief in 2 equal opposite powers that control the universe, one good and the other evil), not ""Substance Dualism"". In this article he's responding to C. E. M. Joad, a British philosopher who was arguing in favor of Cosmic Dualism. (Lewis wrote this essay while WWII was happening).      (God in the Dock, Part 1, Chapter 1 ""Evil and God"")   (Quote)   ""We are left then to choose between monotheism and dualism—between a single, good, almighty source of being, and two equal, uncreated, antagonistic Powers, one good and the other bad. Dr. Joad suggests that the latter view stands to gain from the ‘new urgency’ of the fact of evil. But what new urgency? Evil may seem more urgent to us than it did to the Victorian philosophers—favoured members of the happiest class in the happiest country in the world at the world’s happiest period. But it is no more urgent for us than for the great majority of monotheists all down the ages. The classic expositions of the doctrine that the world’s miseries are compatible with its creation and guidance by a wholly good Being come from Boethius waiting in prison to be beaten to death and from St Augustine meditating on the sack of Rome. The present state of the world is normal; it was the last century that was the abnormality.   This drives us to ask why so many generations rejected Dualism. Not, assuredly, because they were unfamiliar with suffering; and not because its obvious prima facie plausibility escaped them. It is more likely that they saw its two fatal difficulties, the one metaphysical, and the other moral.   The metaphysical difficulty is this. The two Powers, the good and the evil, do not explain each other. Neither Ormuzd nor Ahriman can claim to be the Ultimate. More ultimate than either of them is the inexplicable fact of their being there together. Neither of them chose this tête-à-tête. Each of them, therefore, is conditioned—finds himself willy-nilly in a situation; and either that situation itself, or some unknown force which produced that situation, is the real Ultimate. Dualism has not yet reached the ground of being. You cannot accept two conditioned and mutually independent beings as the self-grounded, self-comprehending Absolute. On the level of picture-thinking this difficulty is symbolised by our inability to think of Ormuzd and Ahriman without smuggling in the idea of a common space in which they can be together and thus confessing that we are not yet dealing with the source of the universe but only with two members contained in it.

"How is it possible to be an consecrated a bishop and then teach but not teach under the auspices of your being a bishop, i.e. ""teacher""? If you are made a teacher, and you teach, you are exercising your ""teacher"" role.      But the _bindingness_ of bishops' teachings varies in degree, according to the manner in which they propose them to us ""to be held"". Some they assert with great force and definitude, with explicit reference to this being something taught by the Church from time immemorial. Others they teach less definitely, but still ""with authority"". Others again they teach very mildly, but still as something they want us to accept. These are all _teachings_ and therefore they must be received by us, _in accord with the MANNER in which they were proposed to be received._ There are infinitely many degrees in which their teachings require assent from us, as is the infinitely many degrees of the teachings being taught with an expectation of being received.      It is when a bishop, either by venue, by context, or by clear mention, indicates that he is merely speculating or indulging in pious but uncertain considerations, that he is not asking for our assent as such. When he says things like ""well, _it seems to me_ "", or ""in my personal opinion,"" or ""I feel that X, but others may feel differently"" he is indicating room for dissent by others.      But note also that the venue is not WHOLLY determinative: in an encyclical, a pope might state a new idea that is his own personal view but is still uncertain, and also re-state a time-honored and universally approved teaching. The fact that the venue is _capable_ of teaching high and _strongly_ authoritative statements (and is the normal venue for doing so) does not mean every word in the encyclical bears that degree.

"Under Benedict, the International Theological Commission issued a _statement_ , not a definitive statement, on the status of children who die without sacramental baptism. In it, they stated unequivocally that the theory of Limbo is, as before, an available theological teaching. They also identified ambiguities in the possible meaning of ""Limbo"". They tried to give, to the best they could, a reason to _deny_ the idea of Limbo by laying out ""the case"" for such children being saved and going to heaven. Unfortunately for their effort, (so far as I can see), the entire argument they give, in order to defeat the position of there being a Limbo (of some sort) would be _**equally**_ an argument that ALL men must go to heaven, regardless how many sins in they are guilty of a few moments before death.

And the latter has always been part of the basis for the position that the magisterial office is protected from error, though not protected _in every sense._ It is pretty odd to think of Christ conveying (to bishops) an authority to teach _in his name,_ but NOT do anything about protecting said teachings of those teachers, just the teachings of the pope. And when the bishops, in their **ordinary** teachings, teach a truth that is also universally taught by the other bishops, **that** teaching is not only protected _somewhat_ (i.e. like the kind of protection over those teachings to which we owe religious submission), those teachings are infallible and we owe them unreserved assent. So, the bishops in exercising their _ordinary_ teaching office can at least touch on the higher protection, which _suggests_ that they also can touch on the lower protection afforded those teachings to which we owe religious assent - also in their ordinary exercise of their teaching office. That is, both acts are acts of their ordinary teaching office, the difference in the kind of submission we owe being EXTERNAL to the teaching act itself: it is implausible that we would come to owe UNRESERVED assent to a teaching of our bishop once we realize that it has universal agreement of the other bishops, but that _before_ we completed that discovery that we owed it not even the smallest smidgen of religious submission even when we have discovered wide agreement of many bishops (but have not yet established a universal agreement).",well know convince authority teach always connected hears hears latter always part basis position magisterial office protected error though protected every sense pretty odd think christ conveying bishop authority teach name anything protecting said teaching teacher teaching pope bishop ordinary teaching teach truth also universally taught bishop teaching protected somewhat ie like kind protection teaching owe religious submission teaching infallible owe unreserved assent bishop exercising ordinary teaching office least touch higher protection suggests also touch lower protection afforded teaching owe religious assent - also ordinary exercise teaching office act act ordinary teaching office difference kind submission owe external teaching act implausible would come owe unreserved assent teaching bishop realize universal agreement bishop completed discovery owed even smallest smidgen religious submission even discovered wide agreement many bishop yet established universal agreement,feser,1669,0,1637

"But, like the passages cited by Walford, this one simply does not show what O’Regan thinks it does. What the _Catholic Encyclopedia_ says is that the Church cannot err when “ _defining_ ” a truth of revelation. What this means is that it is protected from error when it puts forward some teaching in a _solemn and definitive_ manner (as it does in the decrees of an ecumenical council, or through an _ex cathedra_ papal definition). The claim is _not_ that absolutely every magisterial statement, including those of a less solemn and definitive nature, will be free of error. Nor does the doctrine of the Church’s indefectibility imply that. Certainly O’Regan does nothing to show otherwise (as opposed to merely _asserting_ otherwise).",like passage cited walford one simply show regan think catholic encyclopedia say church can not err “ defining ” truth revelation mean protected error put forward teaching solemn definitive manner decree ecumenical council ex cathedra papal definition claim absolutely every magisterial statement including le solemn definitive nature free error doctrine indefectibility imply certainly regan nothing show otherwise opposed merely asserting otherwise,feser,736,0,1653
"One might object that it's Christianity in the ""Mere Christianity"" sense but I think one ought to be very skeptical of those notions. I think that Catholic alliance with Protestants has to be very specific and limited to the shared doctrinal positions. The alliance with regards to shared positions maybe useful at the academic level in order to defend some shared positions, at the public level it may help to convince people of those shared positions since two factions who otherwise disagree with each other atleast agree on those positions but that's as far as it goes, at the missionary level in terms of actual conversions it's hard to form any proper alliance which also doesn't give the impression that ""it doesn't matter what denomination you are as long as you are Christian"", from a strictly Catholic perspective anyone outside the catholic faith including protestants are objectively speaking in a mortally grave situation, one might say in less of a grave situation as compared to other faiths but still mortally grave. (Once you are in the realm of mortal graveness, the gravities don't matter as much). So it doesn't make sense to have any strong national movement with Christianity in general as a theme. Either it will distort doctrine or fizzle into something like ""Catholic Nationalism"" or ""Protestant Nationalism"" with the parent movement being nothing more then an Unholy Alliances (Not the best foundation for a lasting and successful movement)      One might then object by saying that the nation was founded on distinctively Christian values except for the fact that it wasn't, A Jew might object and say the values are Jewish, the values are often referred to as ""Judaeo"" - Christian after all, For Christians, Christianity is the fulfillment of Judaism but for practicing Jews, Christianity is not some kind of fulfilment but merely some aberration. So jews could claim those values without really having to relate it to Christianity. Out of recognition of the jewish heritage we generally say Judaeo-Christian but then it seems to me we have effectively left behind ""Christian"" Nationalism for a Judaeo Christian one , if you factor in that some founding fathers were Deist, it complicates thing further.

"Let us see what say, Oderberg has to say about virtual existence. In pg. 71 of ""Real Essentialism"":      ""Supposing there to be elementary particles (a proposal I deny), and supposing these to be quarks, it does not follow from the fact that every material substance is made of quarks that every substantial form is the form of a bundle of quarks, because in the existing substance the quarks have no substantial identity of their own, their behaviour having been fully yoked to the function and operations of the substance in which they exist. The substantial forms of the particles exist virtually in the substances they constitute. In other words, the quark is ontologically dependent on the whole of which it is a part, but its causal powers persist, albeit in a way radically limited by the whole. The substantial form is what determines the permissible and impermissible behaviour of the quarks in the body, which is why some chemical reactions typically occur, others rarely, and others not at all. Nor is there any particular bundle of quarks of which the form could even be the form, given the familiar fact that every body loses and gains quarks all the time. Again, it is the form that determines the when, how, and how much of the loss and gain may occur, with external circumstances merely operating upon predetermined possibilities.""      From this characterization, what we should expect is that the behavior of a free electron (or whatever elementary particle) is radically different from an electron in an hydrogen atom (in a molecule, in a protein, in a cell, all the way up the levels of substantial organization), which is precisely what happens and any half-decent physicist will confirm. Or simply open a quantum mechanics textbook and see the radically different solutions of the Schroedinger equation for a free particle or a particle in a potential well or in a Coulomb potential, etc.      ""However, Albert the Great and Duns Scotus held a different view: namely, that the human body contains forms at multiple levels, which means that the particles comprising it are still particles.""      This is a related, but different issue (and indeed one hotly debated in medieval times), the unicity of substantial form.      ""By contrast, with quantum indeterminacy, when some property of a particle (say, its spin) is not defined (say, ""up-or-down"", or ""F-or-G""), we cannot say it is not actually F (""up""); all we can say is that it is not (actually) up- and-not-down (F-and-not-G) or down-and not-up (G-and-not-F).""

"I don't think people most people actually understand the accusation if pantheism they're making. An identification of God with Existence or, to use more platonic language, The One (The Good), cannot in principle be a pantheistic conception, since the world is obviously a complex and changing object. Panentheism may fit better, but even here outside of emanating from a singular object, due to the absolute simplicity of the absolute, it's impossible for the world to be a part of it, it lacks the parts with which anything outside of it could ever truly be related to it. Arguably, the platonist conception of the absolute is even simpler than Aristotle's unmoved mover, for the reason that Plotinus argues against Aristotle's idea of it being Thinking thinking about thoughts. Whether it's correct or not, Plotinus argues that every kind of knowledge involves minimal composition. In that sense, the One cannot be an intellect, which doesn't mean though that it's wholly unmental.      It may be easier for me than for others here since, even though I'd call myself Christian, I have zero emotional investment in the religion and would be indifferent to dropping it, but the accusation that a lofty conception of God removes any kind of personal relation, for me, just shows that we too heavily rely on a, frankly, infantile conception of the supreme being, instead of following the intellectual route of letting ourselves be led into complete apophaticism, in the footsteps of Plotinus and Pseudo-Dionysius. What would knowledge be if it doesn't change? Well, not the knowledge of truths we know it, but acts that *produce* these truths. The convergence with existence and the ultimate dependency of everything on it entails that at the grass roots of knowledge, power or morality, these concepts are entailed by existence/goodness. This is just the logical consequence, something O'Conner hinted at in his book on the contingency argument. Furthermore in regards to knowledge I'd once again reference Barry Miller who quotes Patrick Grim, the idea of omniscience as propositional knowledge (P is true, God knows that P), is not a conception that can be applied to God, this just leads to contradictions. But it also means that his mode of knowledge would be as much comparable to ours as Aquinas' pure esse would be to Frege's existential quantifier",think people people actually understand accusation pantheism making identification god existence use platonic language one good can not principle pantheistic conception since world obviously complex changing object panentheism may fit better even outside emanating singular object due absolute simplicity absolute impossible world part lack part anything outside could ever truly related arguably platonist conception absolute even simpler unmoved mover reason plotinus argues idea thinking thinking thought whether correct plotinus argues every kind knowledge involves minimal composition sense one can not intellect mean though wholly unmental may easier others since even though call christian zero emotional investment religion would indifferent dropping accusation lofty conception god remove kind personal relation show heavily rely frankly infantile conception supreme instead following intellectual route letting led complete apophaticism footstep plotinus pseudo-dionysius would knowledge change well knowledge truth know act produce truth convergence existence ultimate dependency everything entail grass root knowledge power morality concept entailed existencegoodness logical consequence something conner hinted book contingency argument furthermore regard knowledge reference barry miller quote patrick grim idea omniscience propositional knowledge p true god know p conception applied god lead contradiction also mean mode knowledge would much comparable pure esse would existential quantifier,feser,2354,0,1659

"Hi Miguel,      You refer to ""the total lack of any official Church pronouncement in Biblical texts, Councils, or the Barque itself, to the effect that the Church believed in a corporeal God - even for five minutes, never mind centuries.""      I never claimed that the Church made an official pronouncement stating that God is corporeal. Official pronouncements are not the only guide to Church belief, however; one can also appeal to what has been ""believed always, everywhere, and by all,"" as St. Vincent of Lerins put it. The witness of the early Church Fathers prior to c.300 A.D. is divided: Clement of Alexandria, Tatian the Syrian, Irenaeus and Origen (and possibly Athenagoras) affirm an incorporeal God, while Melito of Sardis, Tertullian and Lactantius affirm the contrary. Moreover, Origen admits that the Church's teaching on the subject was unsettled in his day: ""How God himself is to be understood, - whether as corporeal and formed according to some shape or of a different nature from bodies"" is ""a point which is not clearly indicated in our teachings."" (De Principiis, Preface, para. 9)      Finally, there is overwhelming evidence (presented by Francesca Stavrakopoulou in her book, ""God: An Anatomy"") that the Biblical authors did not envisage God in classical theistic terms, but as a corporeal being. For instance, regarding the goddess Asherah, Stavrakopoulou writes that ""scholars are now widely agreed that she functioned traditionally as Yahweh's consort"" (p. 149). God originally had a wife. It was only after the return from the Babylonian Exile (in the late sixth century B.C.) that ""Yahweh lost his wife, while other members of his divine council were downgraded from deities to minor divine beings, heavenly messengers, or cosmic abstractions"" (p. 152). Thomas Römer comes to the same conclusion in his book, ""The Invention of God"" (Harvard University Press, 2015) - see https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674504974 .      Finally, there is no good evidence of widespread Jewish or Christian belief in an incorporeal God in the first century A.D., and there is plenty of evidence to the contrary.      Tim,      I wasn't appealing to the Hellenization thesis in my argument. In any case, even among the Greeks, the common folk doubtless believed in corporeal deities. And there's no evidence that the Jews ever believed in an immortal and immaterial soul, or for that matter, an incorporeal God, prior to their encounter with Greek philosophy in the third century B.C. Aristobulus of Alexandria (150 B.C.) was the first Jew to propound such a view, and it took centuries to become a widespread one within Judaism. Cheers.

"The definition you gave at the end is right though it's only intended to be general. More correctly, it would read, ""Rites consist of the diverse etc."" - not diverse syllogisms. The logic is juridical, not metaphysical. Rites are quite easy to categorize now. Thanks to Roman government, they also correspond to recognizable structural differences between rites, and official status as such. Arcane discussions are not very relevant to this discernment. For instance, whether the Mozarabic rite really belongs to the Jacobite liturgical family is supremely irrelevant to a Syrian Christian who happens to stumble into the Rite of Toledo today. Binding and loosing is very appropriate when its comes to the Church's law regarding official worship. This is the province of its government, by definition. And being Roman, it always settles down to what is most sensible and practical, eventually.      I leave you to worry about whether the Church might declare the Novus Ordo to be another rite that is not the Roman rite.

"@Infinite Growth (continued)      The area that we have to be most careful in is in judging particular intentions associated with a particular act. It is here that judgements are most unsure. Now, we also have to be careful not to completely de-link intentions from the exterior act. (This is a problem that occurred in 20th century Catholic theology. On this point, see Matthew Levering's recent book The Abuse of Conscience). The act is intended by the person and if the act is bad then the intention is bad in some way. However, the person again may be acting from ignorance or confusion or trying to achieve some real good and yet be going about it in the wrong way. In this instance, you can again explain moral principles and why a particular act is not good and this should help to guide their intentions in the future as they realize, for example, that a good end does not justify a bad means. etc.      However some people are in fact habitually bad. That is, they have bad character. In this instance another work of mercy is called for: Rebuking the sinner.      Regarding your suggestion that our only enemy is the principalities, this also is based on a partial reading of St. Paul. St. Paul also identifies the flesh as our enemy in Galatians 5:19ff, ""Now the deeds of the flesh (Greek: sarx) are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, etc..."" He warns that those who practice these things will not inherit the kingdom of God. Flesh is used in multiple and analogous ways in the NT and can be used to simply refer to the body, but here it refers to sinful desires, intentions and acts. So the flesh, in this sense, is also an enemy of the Christian according to Paul.      If we take a broader focus on the New Testament, we also find that ""the world"" (Greek: kosmos) is also an enemy of the Christian and this is reflected in the writings of St. John. Kosmos is also used in multiple senses in the NT so this does not entail that each use refers to something bad. However, a worldly spirit that says ""Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die"" (i.e. ""this world is all there is""; hence worldliness) is contrary to authentic faith and is another enemy of the Christian.      It is for this reason that the council of Trent identified three enemies of the Catholic viator: Satan, the world, and the flesh. So, the suggestion that we have only one enemy is based on a partial consideration of the New Testament at the exclusion of other parts.",infinite growth continued area careful judging particular intention associated particular act judgement unsure also careful completely de-link intention exterior act problem occurred th century catholic theology point see matthew recent book abuse conscience act intended person act bad intention bad way however person may acting ignorance confusion trying achieve real good yet going wrong way instance explain moral principle particular act good help guide intention future realize example good end justify bad mean etc however people fact habitually bad bad character instance another work mercy called rebuking sinner regarding suggestion enemy principality also based partial reading st paul st paul also identifies flesh enemy galatian ff deed flesh greek sarx evident immorality impurity sensuality idolatry sorcery enmity strife jealousy etc warns practice thing inherit kingdom god flesh used multiple analogous way nt used simply refer body refers sinful desire intention act flesh sense also enemy christian according paul take broader focus new testament also find world greek kosmos also enemy christian reflected writing st john kosmos also used multiple sens nt entail use refers something bad however worldly spirit say eat drink merry tomorrow die ie world hence worldliness contrary authentic faith another enemy christian reason council trent identified three enemy catholic viator satan world flesh suggestion one enemy based partial consideration new testament exclusion part,feser,2520,0,1702

Has no basis on reality and is mere play with definitions(which smart empiricists do defend).      2\. Come from something else.      The prussian argued that at least mathematics is a sort of necessary knowledge that is not created by language, so 2 won. His answer was that we can know some truths about how we happen to organize sense data by analysing the necessary conditions to our experience to it to be how it is. For instance, every experience we have is in time, it has a sucession and all that, so we can derive several truths about that(inded, mathematics would have his origin on the forms of time and space).      And so, by knowing this structure we could show that every possible experience we could have need to obey a certain structure and so gather several truths about how things appear to us.

Definitions can change over time according to ideological and cultural whims.      I don't believe in ""forms"" in the platonic (or A-T) sense.

They do not bring any more intelligibility into an argument than fate does. They cannot sneak in objectivity.      Nominalism is not the antithesis of knowledge. It's an awareness that though categories are a human way of organizing and talking about the world, there is no reason to think the categories exist independently of us. It's reasonable to claim those whitish things in the sky look similar and behave similarly so we will call them ""clouds"" for reference, but we still recognize each ""cloud"" is unique.

"Hi ccmnxc and The Deuce,      For the record, I broke with the ID movement back in 2016, after concluding that its scientific claims didn't add up and that its mathematical arguments were invalid.      The Thomistic version of hylomorphism espoused by Koons (and by Ed) is quite radical. What it says is that a proton which is part of a human body isn't a proton: the constituent particles of ordinary objects are ""only potentially rather than actually entities in their own right,"" as Ed succinctly puts it in his review. The claim being made here is not just that they're only potentially independent; rather, what Thomists claim is that they're only potentially entities. However, Albert the Great and Duns Scotus held a different view: namely, that the human body contains forms at multiple levels, which means that the particles comprising it are still particles.      A physicist will tell you that the protons in a human body are indistinguishable from free-floating protons, and that their properties undergo no change when that body dies. This indicates that they do not cease to be entities, when they're incorporated into a human body.      I might add that there is a fundamental dis-analogy between quantum indeterminacy and the Aristotelian notion of potency. According to Aristotle, while an object is only potentially F, it is not actually F. By contrast, with quantum indeterminacy, when some property of a particle (say, its spin) is not defined (say, ""up-or-down"", or ""F-or-G""), we cannot say it is not actually F (""up""); all we can say is that it is not (actually) up-and-not-down (F-and- not-G) or down-and not-up (G-and-not-F).      The discovery of indefinite properties at the micro-level has no bearing on the question of whether we need to invoke the concept of potency to account for accidental or substantial change at the macro-level.      Finally, while I agree with Ed that radical atomism and radical holism pose a threat to Christianity, I would suggest that the antidote is not radical hylomorphism, but a more nuanced view, which recognizes that ordinary-level may be viewed as fundamental from one perspective, as aggregates from another perspective, and as modifications of a larger whole from yet another perspective.

"Anonymous January 23, 2023 at 9:39 AM,   I think careful answers to your questions depend highly upon the precise definitions applied to terms you have employed.      What does it mean to exist? No trivial question. Does running exist? Does running have mass, or any other static measurable property? Does running somehow exist Platonically? Or is it simply gibberish to even suggest running has an independent existence? I would say that material in the arrangement we identify as an animal exists and running is an identifiable process of such material. Material exists and form is a property of material that has no independent existence.      Can we say for certain that such things as mereological simples do in fact exist? Certainly, modern physics is highly incomplete and such simples have yet to be identified and precisely described.      Down thread Tom pointed out that in a molecule, say of water, what we call the constituent atoms are not precisely the same as they were as individual atoms, and indeed, forming of bonds is exothermic, so Tom is correct in that respect. Further, the orbitals of the electrons are of a different shape once the molecule is formed, so in that sense the water molecule is a different thing than simply the three free atoms were.      So, do we know that a vaunted mereological simple retains its precise identity as such when joined with other asserted simples, or does the process of joining entail at least some small change in the constituents such that the former simples lose their precise identities as such in the process of joining, in a manner somewhat analogous to the changes hydrogen and oxygen undergo to form water?      As for purpose, I did not precisely claim purpose in no sense ever arises at any level. That would seem to be a self defeating claim, similar to claiming that I do not exist in any sense or in any form.      I said that purpose is a human projection, and I meant that with respect to inanimate objects, say, a rock. Is the purpose of the rock to provide a shelter for bugs, or to be filler in my gravel driveway, or to be a hammerstone to make a tool, or to be a weapon to bash your enemy with? The rock is just the rock, it has no intrinsic or ultimate or universal or absolute purpose. Any notion of purpose for the rock is a matter of human projection.      Purpose is a human emotion, like the sense of ought, a personal feeling each of us may experience. Like running, purpose has no independent existence, rather, purpose is an identifiable process of material, the workings of the human brain.

"@RunDec      Given that, as I understand it, to qualify as a classical theist, a thinker has to, principally, adhere to divine simplicity, I readily concede that this is compatible with a necessitarian view, and that of many thinkers classified as such. This compatibility, however, obviously does not entail its truth. Fr. Davies seems to concern himself with rebutting the claim that divine simplicity entails it, and to achieve this he doesn’t need to positively prove the account he happens to think is the true classical theist account, namely, presumably that of St. Thomas. After all, it’s not like classical theism is a concrete comprehensive philosophical doctrine or “system” as opposed to a (contingently useful) classification abstracting from the all-important theoretical peculiarities.      Now, in light of your reference to pure act, I assumed that it is this account that you had in mind, and I submit that, I find, the way the pure act argument works is straightforward, really: agents act for an end, and where there is no necessary relation between the means and an end, there is no necessity. Because, on the one hand, God is pure act, something per se perfect, and is the only possible end for His acts, and creatures fail to contribute anything to His perfection, on the other, God cannot be said to will the creatures necessarily.

"I have never heard of any **authoritative** assertion that an abused wife _should_ stay with the husband, and especially not say it as if it represented a rule. Adrian Fonseca is just a news & commentary purveyor, has no authority to hold forth on ""a teaching"". So, absent any new datum, it's ""just some guy bloviating"". Like me, here.      The Chrisitan doctrine on suffering is multi-layered, and should not be reduced to a simple sentence. That said, 4 points are at the heart: (1) not all suffering can be avoided while staying on the right side of the line of good action. (2) When suffering _can_ be avoided by a morally licit choice, it is often prudent (i.e. good, right action) to so. (3) In spite of (2), there are ALSO many situations where some part of suffering can be avoided, but willingly taking on and accepting the suffering (taking the suffering yourself, not subjecting another to the suffering) can be spiritually valuable, and **in general** a good Christian should expect to accept AT LEAST SOME avoidable suffering along his life. (4) Accepting avoidable suffering is _never_ done for its own sake, and therefore it can generally be accounted as being accepted for some other thing, a good that (will) more than offset the evil suffered. This is not intrinsically different from doing (troublesome) exercise to make the body (and soul) stronger - and there is little debate about that kind of ""accepting suffering"".

"Right: it is Good's delight to spread good, not solely when and because it is ""owed"", but even where good is not owed. Thus, God's act of creation is spreading good where no good is owed - no thing _deserves_ to be granted existence, so for every thing, its existence is a gift to it.      And just as a good person can give goods to others where they are not owed, out of kindness, generosity, or mercy: so also a person can _relieve debt_ as a kind of gift to the person who owes. To show this more easily: if John owes me $100, and Bill kindly pays John's debt to me, I am paid off, and John no longer owes me. If Bill does this as a gift, nobody is HURT and my debt is satisfied.      Similarly, if I decide to ""pay off"" John's debt to me by considering it paid, I make a gift to John like Bill does above. Gifts are not **contrary** to justice, they are BESIDE it. It's just that I am both the giver and the one whose receivable is ""paid off"" by my gift.      For moral wrongs, we cannot forgive the part of the wrong that lies in the _sin against God_ , because that is a debt owed toward God, not us. But we can forgive the part that is owed to us.      Broadly speaking, it may be either prudent or imprudent to easily forgive some debts against us: too easily forgiving money debts could cause some people to become spendthrifts and wastrels. Similarly, too readily forgiving _offenses_ against us might have a similar result. But aside from that measure of prudence, Christ tells us to be willing to forgive any and all offenses against ourselves, and indeed the examples of both Christ and the saints shows them forgiving persecutors right in the midst of those acts of persecution - where clearly no remorse exists.      Perhaps someone can clarify distinctions about granting forgiveness of the _offense_ (qua guilt) while not relieving the debt of some kind of restitution? That, it seems, is part of what Oktavian is raising.",right delight spread good solely owed even good owed thus act creation spreading good good owed - thing deserves granted existence every thing existence gift good person give good others owed kindness generosity mercy also person relieve debt kind gift person owes show easily john owes bill kindly pay debt paid john longer owes bill gift nobody hurt debt satisfied similarly decide pay debt considering paid make gift john like bill gift contrary justice beside giver one whose receivable paid gift moral wrong can not forgive part wrong lie sin god debt owed toward god u forgive part owed u broadly speaking may either prudent imprudent easily forgive debt u easily forgiving money debt could cause people become spendthrift wastrel similarly readily forgiving offense u might similar result aside measure prudence christ tell u willing forgive offense indeed example christ saint show forgiving persecutor right midst act persecution - clearly remorse exists perhaps someone clarify distinction granting forgiveness offense qua guilt relieving debt kind restitution seems part oktavian raising,feser,1940,0,1747

"Great lecture, Ed. But I find it difficult, or at least not at all obvious, in which of the two tendencies you identify within socialism we should place traditional Marxist socialism (communism).      On one side, communism is internationalist (as opposed to the tribalism of national socialism) and the ideal state it aspires to reach after the dictatorship of the proletariat is pursued as good in great part because it would allow the fullest self-realisation and happiness of each individual.      But on the other hand, communism is and has always been very collectivist, inasmuch as it understands each individual as an integral part of one of two antagonistic social classes, where one of them oppresses the other. In this sense, the individual attributes of each person take a back seat and the only thing that really matters is whether he or she belongs to the oppressor or the oppressed class. By the way, we also see this today in modern egalitarian socialism when it divides people into male vs. female, white vs. non-white, straight vs. queer, etc.; and provides confession of guilt, ‘deconstruction’ and full adherence to the woke agenda as only means for redemption if you belong to the privileged group.      Moreover, traditional communism has also historically had no problem eliminating individuals and even entire collectives for the sake of the community in its struggle for utopia.      To be clear, I strongly oppose both socialism and liberal individualism, but I have doubts with the idea that national socialism and alike movements are (broadly speaking) the only forms of socialism that reject this individualism or even that modern forms of socialism fully adhere to it.",great lecture ed find difficult least obvious two tendency identify within socialism place traditional marxist socialism communism one side communism internationalist opposed tribalism national socialism ideal state aspires reach dictatorship proletariat pursued good great part would allow fullest self-realisation happiness individual hand communism always collectivist inasmuch understands individual integral part one two antagonistic social class one oppresses sense individual attribute person take back seat thing really matter whether belongs oppressor oppressed class way also see today modern egalitarian socialism divide people male v female white v non-white straight v queer etc provides confession guilt ‘ deconstruction full adherence woke agenda mean redemption belong privileged group moreover traditional communism also historically problem eliminating individual even entire collective sake community struggle utopia clear strongly oppose socialism liberal individualism doubt idea national socialism alike movement broadly speaking form socialism reject individualism even modern form socialism fully adhere,feser,1698,0,1751

"@Ed Feser      So why believe Chapman over Bellarmine?      Seems the problem is the term ""heresy"" has undergone a development over the past 2000 years. The Greek term literally means to break off from the whole. In it's early use simply not following the discipline of the Church made you a heretic (where as in later times we would call you a mere schismatic). Thought in later times it is narrowly defined to refer to professing a false & formally condemned doctrinal proposition.      Allowing heresy to be taught or failing to condemn it can get you labelled a ""heretic"" even if you do not hold to any formal doctrinal or moral errors.      Also I think condemning anybody as a heretic is an act of discipline not faith and morals. I don't think the Catholic Church has the power to infallibly say Nestorius was a heretic. But she can infallibly say Nestorianism (the false view Christ is two persons, one divine and one human attributed to Nestorius) is heresy.      Which is why you can in theory rehabilitate a heretic. You don't know their subjective intent with any certainty. But you can know a given doctrinal proposition is false when the Church has clearly condemned it.

These are horrendous sufferings which serve no ""greater good,"" and which can destroy even a good individual's faith, as the following account of the 17th century ""torture in the pit"" illustrates:      https://sspx.org/en/news-events/news/real-life-silences-character      There were priests, many of them good men, who apostasized. What good was served?      You also cite Augustine to support the following claim: ""We cannot achieve happiness in the world to come if we become too attached to the world that is, and suffering is a means of preventing the latter.""      This might explain some of the suffering that befalls adults, but it fails to explain the death and suffering of a child, who has no worldly attachments.      Finally, original sin (or the fall of Adam) is said to be the ultimate explanation for why humans are permitted to suffer and die, rather than enjoying immortality and bliss. I am not persuaded that a dumb choice by a distant ancestor makes it fair for us to be allowed to suffer soul-breaking evils of the sort described above, but let that pass. What original sin cannot explain is the fact that people (e.g. political prisoners, psychiatric patients) have been beaten or tortured to death, while screaming for Divine deliverance or at least some Divine consolation (i.e. a sense of ""I am with you"") at the moment of death, and in many cases, it never arrives: they die in agony and desolation. Spiritual abandonment at the hour of death is the most difficult evil of all to make sense of, and if you can make any sense of it, Ed, you're a better man than I.      For my part, I think it's best to honestly acknowledge that some evil in this world is indeed gratuitous and senseless, and that there are some dark recesses of the human psyche which God Himself cannot reach: He can console us while we're in pain, but not while we're in agony, as that severs the communication channels.

"Moreover, Dreyfus points out, this computationalist model is an inheritance from the post-Cartesian approach to scientific explanation, according to which explaining a physical event involves identifying the laws by which it follows of necessity from antecedent events, in a manner that might be modeled by a machine. But this mechanistic model only works when we abstract out of it anything that smacks of the psychological – consciousness, intentionality, and so on. (This is precisely why Descartes had to relocate consciousness out of the material world and in a separate _res cogitans_ , as Chomsky himself emphasizes later in the discussion with Goff and Frankish.) Hence an approach that appeals to computational rules, given its essentially mechanistic character, precisely _leaves out_ what is distinctive of the mental, and thus cannot coherently claim to _account for_ the mental.",moreover dreyfus point computationalist model inheritance post-cartesian approach scientific explanation according explaining physical event involves identifying law follows necessity antecedent event manner might modeled machine mechanistic model work abstract anything smack psychological – consciousness intentionality precisely descartes relocate consciousness material world separate re cogitans chomsky emphasizes later discussion goff frankish hence approach appeal computational rule given essentially mechanistic character precisely leaf distinctive mental thus can not coherently claim account mental,feser,891,0,1791

AnonymousJanuary 2, 2023 at 7:54 PM, I appreciate the long and thoughtful reply.      ""the point Feser is making is that, unsurprisingly, the Aristotelian view of matter seems to fit what we observe in the quantum realm.""   Indeed, that is a core error of Dr. Feser.      Aristotle made a fundamental mistake in his view that all sublunary motion is in an impeding medium such that a moving object, absent a mover for it, will slow and stop, and it's motion will be lost.      That notion, that fundamental Aristotelian error, is nowhere supported in modern physics.      That core error of Aristotle led to the already scientifically falsified First Way by Aquinas. If that incorrect notion of Aristotle were correct then the First Way would actually be a very good argument for an unmoved mover. (here is one good source if you are interested in the 5 Ways, iteadthomam.blogspot.com/2011/01/first-way-in-syllogistic-form)      Aristotle actually had the concept of Newtonian perpetual motion in his grasp, in Aristotle's book 4 of his physics, where Aristotle describes motion as continuing ad infinitum in the void.      Bertrand Russel wrote some 100 years ago describing at length the errors of Aristotle, and described how tedious it was to read the ancient Aristotelian philosophers because nearly everything they said about physics was wrong.      ""I don’t think it’s a good counter argument to merely say, you just haven’t reduced far enough""   Ok, you can think that, fine, but actually, yes, it is the case that in the example of hydrogen, oxygen, and water Feser projects notions that seem somehow vaguely reasonable but quickly break down when one considers further reductionist models. Hydrogen, oxygen, and water are all large scale structures relative to the underlying reality, which is just much smaller scale material whizzing about interreacting as they do with whatever happens to be in the vicinity, utterly oblivious to any larger scale structures and devoid of purpose or any potential to be a building block of purpose.      Modern physics is devoid of purpose at any scale, so the assertion that modern physics in any way vindicates Aristotelian notions of purpose, or motion, or change...well, such assertions are just plain wrong.",oh ooops posted anonymous well thanks folk welcomed back posting interface changed slightly default anonymous neglected change anonymousjanuary pm appreciate long thoughtful reply point feser making unsurprisingly aristotelian view matter seems fit observe quantum realm indeed core error dr feser aristotle made fundamental mistake view sublunary motion impeding medium moving object absent mover slow stop motion lost notion fundamental aristotelian error nowhere supported modern physic core error aristotle led already scientifically falsified first way aquinas incorrect notion aristotle correct first way would actually good argument unmoved mover one good source interested way iteadthomamblogspotcomfirst-way-in-syllogistic-form aristotle actually concept newtonian perpetual motion grasp book physic aristotle describes motion continuing ad infinitum void bertrand russel wrote year ago describing length error aristotle described tedious read ancient aristotelian philosopher nearly everything said physic wrong think good counter argument merely say reduced far enough ok think fine actually yes case example hydrogen oxygen water feser project notion seem somehow vaguely reasonable quickly break one considers reductionist model hydrogen oxygen water large scale structure relative underlying reality much smaller scale material whizzing interreacting whatever happens vicinity utterly oblivious larger scale structure devoid purpose potential building block purpose modern physic devoid purpose scale assertion modern physic way vindicates aristotelian notion purpose motion changewell assertion plain wrong,feser,2458,0,1794

"My concern is not to assess Francis' personal responsibility or guilt (which we would best leave to God), or even to decide where he would stand in a ranking of popes from best to worst.      Rather, I think our aim should be to defend magisterial statements (albeit non-infallible) from charges of error or inconsistency as far as possible.      Quite a number of Francis' difficult statements are non-magisterial, so for these purposes it suffices to point that out in the particular instances.      With magisterial statements, I realise there is the last resort of withholding assent from non-infallible teachings, by someone who is sufficiently qualified and who has sufficient justifiying reasons. But once someone takes that step in one case, it does seem to easily become a habit, and a bottomless pit of doubt and dissent.      The typical Catholic trying to be faithful, and trying to learn more about their faith from Church documents, isn't in a good position to make these assessments, and they would end up with diminished confidence in a vast range of teachings if they became too easily habituated to having to exercise 'private judgment' upon each one.      So to me it's worthwhile, for the sake of both myself and others, to try to find another way if possible.      In this specific matter of whether we should try to 'convert others' - if we too easily take the most 'anti-evangelizing' interpretation of Francis' words, there will be those who will feel obliged to 'obediently accept' his teaching thus interpreted, with detriment to their own evangelizing efforts.

" _Everybody has the right to criticize everything._      This may represent a _legal_ standard, i.e. nobody is to be punished under civil law for criticizing anything he wants to criticize. But it certainly _does not_ represent the Catholic position on behavior by Catholics. To be specific: criticizing officially declared Church dogma _in a manner repudiating even its basic truth_ (rather than, say, criticizing incompleteness or confused phrasing) is expressly NOT ok for just everyone to do. In fact, it is not OK even for a pope with immense prestige. And Catholics should not _think or feel_ that they are free to criticize just anything: to the extent that they DO feel that way, to that extent they fail to have a Catholic faith.      _Whether a criticism is to be taken seriously has nothing to do with the prestige of the author,_      It is fair to point out that a claim by an author should be evaluated _primarily_ on its own merits rather than on the merits of the author as a person. A good man can make a mistake, and a bad man can say something true.      However, all the same, all of us must make choices as to what claims to _even pay attention to_ enough to go through the effort of evaluating them. Nobody can give ALL claims of all commenters equal weight and evaluate ALL of them independently of who said them. Every person must subject what they hear to a filter that weeds out things that are _not worth their time and attention_. For that purpose, the prestige (insofar as recognized by the hearer) of the person who makes the assertions _is a proper element_ of that filter: a person ought to give some individuals more of their attention, and give others less of their attention, in deciding what to submit to evaluation.      Furthermore, the prestige of the speaker or author also ought to be an element of the evaluation, at least in this manner: a speaker / author who is _known_ to be precise in limiting what _facts_ he claims to have substantiation for ought to be given more credit   in regards to a statement that (so far) has not been substantiated, than a speaker who is known to be sloppy and given to exaggeration regarding claims of facts.

To make clear what I meant by recent politics, take, for example, Act H.R.1226 and Senate Act S.447 through which certain organizations, with the aid of the US government, are trying to extract massive sums of money from the Polish state for so-called heirless property that once belonged to Jews. According to both Polish law and the general legal principle followed virtually everywhere, property without a legal heir reverts to the state after the death of its owner. If a legal heir exists, he is free to pursue restitution like everyone else through the Polish courts. The absurd position of certain groups is that the Polish government should treat these cases in a extraordinary way and offer broad restitution anyway, not to any heirs, because of course they don't exist, but to organizations and people who are not legal heirs. And recall that this was property held by Polish citizens as Polish Jews were Polish citizens. By reinforcing the notion that Poles, as a corporate body, are guilty of collaborating in the criminal program of the Nazis, it becomes easier to make claims on the Polish state. Heirless property, combined with a sprinkle of customary special pleading, misrepresentation, and the thought- diffusing VIP pass that is the word ""Holocaust"", provides a convenient opportunity for unscrupulous organizations to illegitimately extract billions of dollars from the Polish state by exploiting the emotional force of a historical tragedy. Perhaps such organizations should instead direct their claims to Berlin as the German state is responsible for handling the restitution of Jewish property lost through actions of the Nazi regime.

"WCB, I've emailed with Seventh-day Adventists who believe that a soul is a complete human person with a material body. So they quote Genesis in the KJV because it says Adam became a living soul when God breathed into Adam's nose.      But other Protestant Bibles say ""living being"" instead. That alternative phrase suggests that God's breath represents Adam's soul. If it does, it's easy to see that interpretation of the passage supports the Catholic doctrine that a new human person begins when a human sperm fertilizes a human ovum. It also explains why the Catholic Church teaches that deliberate abortion is always murder.      The Adventist idea that a human soul is a complete human person makes it hard to know why Our Lord says, ""My soul is sorrowful, even unto death.""

"To illustrate this general point, he offers as an example the interrogative sentence “Why do things happen?” There is, he says, no possible answer to this, and so it is not a genuine question. Now, I don’t think this is actually a good example, because it seems to me that there is a plausible interpretation of this interrogative sentence on which it amounts to a real question susceptible of an answer. For example, it might be interpreted as asking why the world is such that _change_ occurs in it, rather than being static in the way Parmenides and Zeno took it to be.

"Don Jindra:      1\. _How does immateriality make anything better understood?_      Because matter is divisible and the subject of change. Immateriality is stability and wholeness. If we need wholes capable of understanding and able to apprehend things, matter, per its own definition, can not fit the bill. A scientist that is a ""bag of chemicals"" is constantly in motion, in a Heraclitean flux. So if a scientist sets up an experiment, he/she will not be the same when the experiment gets started and when the experiment finishes. If the scientist is not the same, he won't be able to understand what he was doing. Also, the materials he was employing won't be the same. So science becomes futile. The world becomes unintelligible. You need some anchor, and the substantial form fits the bill. Greeks had this discussion 2500+ years ago.      2\. I'd like you to explain how I need to believe in a phantom ""substance"" to make cause and effect intelligible.      Because if forms exist, natures exist. The world is ordered, and things act according to their ends. Causation is the study of those relations. In your imaginative philosophy, causation is IMPOSED by our neuronal tissue upon the world. If it were not because lots of academics take this absurdity seriously, I would think it's a bad joke.      3\. _I doubt abandoning substantial form forces me into any model._      Then you have not studied enough philosophy of mind :)      4\. _But what is so distasteful about a representationalist theory of mind? It certainly does not prevent me from claiming some knowledge about reality._      Of course it does prevent you. A representation is NOT reality (the name is very explicit). It's an screen of perception. ALL incoming information is filtered through it. Including the sense data of you having a physical body with a brain. And no human can escape this filter. Representationalism is born from physicalist theories (Parmenides and Empedocles). Aristotle corrected that mistake. And St. Thomas perfected Aristotle's theory.      And, ironically, materialism when properly understood collapses into **subjective idealism.**   https://strangenotions.com/naturalisms-epistemological-nightmare/      A ""material mind"" is non-sense. Materialism is not a serious philosophy. It's popular, but horribly flawed.      5\. _You cannot directly perceive immateriality. You have no direct access to forms._      Directly, not. But indirectly, through the accidents of individuals, we can. _Intentiones non-sensate._ And that's because we are properly disposed towards forms. Abandon this disposition and we enter Cartesian, Lockean and Humean skepticism. Aristotle and St. Thomas were NOT skeptics, but externalists and realists. Reality was their turf (although they knew that perception can err and that illusions exist. But for the most part, we apprehend reality and damn well we do). With the ""moderns"", the world becomes a psychiatric ward. Not a good move.      6\. _They are probably the only practical way a brain could cope with the infinite particulars in reality._      Forms and natures solve the problem. Particulars are contained inside the ""boxes"" of natural kinds (universals). We do not need an infinite classificatorial scheme. That would be unachievable. Universals are the models embedded in the fabric of Nature. And we are good at apprehending them. That's why we are scientists and philosophers. And that's why the rest of species are not.      7\. _The gracious Mr. Feser makes this admission when he talks about triangles._      The gracious Mr. Feser knows that point 6 is true.

"From an epistemological point of view, discussing science would be less controversial if we simply acknowledged and agreed that:      (1) Certainty (i.e., the judgement of ""truth"" when comparing what we know with our experiences) is limited to our own personal experiences and cannot be shared with others by definition.      (2) Objectivity (i.e., putting ourselves in the place of the object or pretending to represent its perspective) is an extrapolation that cannot be verified.      (3) Objectivity as impartiality is a matter of consensus among certainties communicated through language and agreement on a narrative.      (4) Mathematics is a human invention in the sense that its rules do not exist a priori in a realm of ideas. It is incorrect to imagine the object of mathematics as something to explore like an unknown land, but it is more akin to something we build like a Lego game. It is also a narrative, where formulas and diagrams are similar to Chinese ideograms in that they can be read and understood within their own cultural frames.      (5) Physics is a narrative, and the evaluation of its quality does not rely on its ability to predict, but on its ability to function as a useful and operational story, depending on the culture in which it is developed. There is no pretension of certainty or objectivity, only impartiality.      (6) Metaphysics is the only narrative that claims to develop a narrative that examines certainty and objectivity as defined above.      (7) What is common to all these narratives, what underlies them all, is logic, and for obvious reasons, the logic that is supported by our own certain experiences, as declined by Aristotle.

"Even if we look at Eric Perl's treatment of Plotinus's so-called 'necessary emmanation' we see that there is an aspect of necessity involved in it. Perl says on pg. 50 of Theophany, ""The necessity of procession, therefore, is in no sense a limitation on the One, but rather an expression of his absolute freedom from any limiting condition whatsoever."" He's clearly denying that the One is constrained by any 'condition,' but that is something the Thomist would also accept. The 'necessity' refers not to the any external condition, but his pure productivity itself. As Perl says, ""For if the One might not produce being, then his productive activity would be distinct from himself and he would be condition by a relation to his product.""      Why is this relevant? Well, one of the arguments of Perl's book is a situating of Pseudo-Dionysius within a Plotinian and Procline metaphysics. So, Perl goes on to state that ""For Dionysius, as for Plotinus, God is nothing but the making of all things, so that the possibility of not making does not arise.... As in Plotinus, to produce all things is not a ""choice"" on God's part... That God cannot not create is a consequence, not a limitation, of his absolute transcendence, his unrelatedness to that which proceeds from him."" Pg. 52      I mean this is the absolute best I can do to make sense of Hart's position - interpret it through the Dionysian idea of diffusive goodness and love. And Hart's supporters frequently point out that he's operating within this 'Neoplatonic and Dionysian tradition,' so my move appears to be justified.      But, an appeal to Denys or the Neoplatonic tradition isn't any argument or textual exegesis, and it seems to me that Dionysius is still subject to the same criticisms raised in Ed's post. Of course, one could deny Perl's reading of the Dionysian metaphysics...

To understand the buddhist position I make an extreme amount of effort (due to how I felt every time I came in contact with it and due to the fact that I'm just a normal guy) and based myself on some works but most specifically: Jay L. Garfield ""engaging buddhism: why it matters to philosophy"" and Mark Siderits ""how things are: an introduction to buddhist metaphysics""      Things to notice about buddhism, in general, is the thesis that they subscribe to mereological nihilism, momentariness (nothing exists more than an instant), nominalism (or conceptualism depending on the 'school'), and what they call ""anti-substancehood"".      If someone is a philosopher (a true philosopher, not a continental one) I do recommend reading the Mark Siderits one since it is a defense of buddhist metaphysics positions in all its aspects (the book cover even says that it is ''buddhist philosophy for philosophers"", so let's commit the fallacy of authority here). So a literate philosopher (not some random guy like me) could see the full picture i.e how far can the arguments go in a necessary way and if they were to be coherent at all at the end of the day. Btw, Ed, I hope that you're reading this.      So, the major differences between their position and ours are that:      1 - they collapse the distinction of act and potency (e.g for something to exist is for it to ""keep producing"" its effects in some way continuously, they use the example of a sprout saying that if the sprout is permanent and not momentary it should keep producing its effect continuously).      2 - they take universals to be ""abstract"" and ""causally ineffective"". Their idea of causality resembles a lot a proto-humean one (like its some kind of idea of the mind conjoining things together).      3 - they do not even address the Aristotelian sense of substance at all and collapse its position with bare substrata. Since this is a ""serious charge"" I will quote a footnote from the Siderits book: ""I am here using “substance” in the Lockean sense of the “something know not what” that underlies and supports an object’s properties. This usage is common to both Aristotle and Nyāya."" (footnote 16, page 65 of the book I've mentioned above).

"@ StardustyPsyche,      ""You may observe that an object comes to a rest, but what you are failing to realize is that other objects increase in their velocity by an amount equal to the observed loss.""      Actually, the Newtonian formulation is _not_ that velocity is conserved. It is that _momentum_ is conserved, _if_ it is measured in _inertial_ coordinates. Furthermore, Newton could not define inertial coordinates, as he well knew. Rest, with respect to the stars, which are in accelerated motion, doesn't work. Still, you ought to get straight the difference between momentum and velocity before you ""explain"" your prejudice to me.      ""No, all motion is in space. You are in space. The medium does not impede motion, rather, neighbors within the medium impede motion of one object by gaining motion for themselves. No net motion is lost""      This is just garbage. If two blobs of putty collide and stick, motion is lost in any inertial reference frame.      ""According to special relativity the mass of an object increases as the speed of the accelerated object approaches c. Energy is not lost, it is gained by the object being accelerated , or gained by any other object the accelerated object loses energy to. E=mc^2 is an expression of the conservation of material.""      You cut off my argument, and substituted something irrelevant to what I said, I guess because you didn't understand it although I put it in pretty simple terms. If an object moves from one place to another with 0 time elapsed on its clock, it is moving at infinite speed. If it changes in a short distance it can't be moving at infinite speed. Populations of neutrinos, which interact so minutely with matter that they can travel tens of thousands of light years through lead without interacting were found to be changing between types in a distance as short as the Earth's diameter. This meant that they had rest mass, and that meant that they couldn't be ""seeing"" time intervals of 0 in their forward direction because if they could they would have to have infinite energy according to special relativity (don't interrupt me again). However, if a constant force were applied in the same direction, its velocity would indeed approach infinity because it would see the time interval over long distances approaching 0 and it would be 0 in the infinite limit. Another way of seeing this is that the space interval in the direction of motion would approach 0 for the forever accelerated object and this would make the distance crossed 0 and it would ""cross the universe"" in 0 time, although unaccelerated observers would see it as a great distance crossed in great time.      So if Aristotle was worried that a mover operating forever would make the speed infinite, he was right even though his concept of motion did not come from modern science but from a different direction that did not contradict science at all.      Since you confuse velocity, momentum, energy, relative motion and absolute motion and change over time with change in the present, and the very meaning of change, I don't think you are doing anything but bootstrapping radical prejudice which blinds you from seeing that your assumptions grossly mislead you and anyone else who takes you seriously.      Also, I doubt that Professor Feser is anywhere as close in agreement with you as you seem to think.

"Now to top things off, there is a common and sinful calumny that comes from the recent disciples of VB that those who believe that hell is and will be occupied want people to be in hell. They are like greedy misers counting coins, but instead they are counting the number of souls in hell and delighting in every enumeration of an additional soul. Those who make these calumnious accusations will answer to the judge of the living and the dead whether or not they believe in the final judgement. Uncharitable habits such as these occur again in the writings of David Hart. The convenient thing about being a universalist is that you can ignore Christ’s commandment to love your neighbor in charitable discourse and can look upon everyone who disagrees with you as an idiot. The inconvenient part about being a universalist is that you will answer to the judge of the living and the dead for the damnable consequences of such a lack of charity. In my estimation, the inconvenient part heavily outweighs the convenient part.      So now to address this calumny. The reason that I care about this issue is the same reason that the popes who condemned positions like what I noted above cared about them. I care about the issue because I care about souls and it is extremely dangerous for people to believe that no one will (or may) ultimately be in hell. It makes Christ's warnings vacuous. I makes the two ways noted in the Didache and the warning abouts life and death in Deuteronomy vacuous. A child that knows his dad will never spank him even though the dad threatens a spanking will at least be tempted to despise his father knowing that he will never make good on his threats. Viewing God as an indulgent of our sins such that He makes threats that will never be realized in any instance is completely absurd. it is for this reason that the position of VB is absurd.

I'm not a philosopher, just a normal guy. And I want to confess something: even though I do not think that something like that (buddhism) is plausible at all, I am afraid of the possibility that it could be because I am ignorant and my OCD does not let me go through this. It was a lot hard to write all these comments - since I am struggling with myself to even conclude a thought. There were a lot more - and a lot more detailed criticism - that I want to write but I simply can't (especially a topic at 4.5 that's the most important part of all it but I don't have the necessary strength and a point that I tried to make à-la Aristotelian retortion in the sense that they must presuppose permanence and can't get rid of it in making their arguments in the same way that Alex Rosenberg can't get rid of intentionality when trying to 'naturalize intentionality').      And for those of you who think: ""why buddhism bothers you that much?"" The answer should be self-evident by now (and for reasons that make simple materialism looks like a weekend at the beach): look at the consequences of all that. There would be no persons, no things, and in some way just suffering. Life would be just horrible. There would be illusions all around us. All persons would be substances per accident - and that's just awful and I can't believe that there are people who find this idea pleasing. And the other reason is OCD. Looks like nothing that I could present by myself is ever sufficient to disprove them. Looks like my arguments are never enough - and since I'm just illiterate in philosophy there is a wall I could never cross.      Unfortunately, I came across buddhism by chance when I was fixated on the experiment of Benjamin Libet on free will (at least his sense of ""free will"") and stumbled across the work of Sam Harris arguing that since there was no free will there is the illusion of the self. Since I have OCD things don't 'go out' of my head that easily (like in the case of normal people). Since the idea per se is insane I tried to understand why people think that it's plausible in the first place. And by their paradoxical 'reductio' way of arguing and the abuse of science that they always propose (bearing in mind that I didn't know that there is such a thing as A-T Meta at the time) that stuck in my head and only got worse through the years.      So, I appreciate it if someone could help me with it. Even though it's not apparent, I tried to put a lot of effort into solving it.

"Hi Son of Ya'Kov,      The article, ""Part II: Early Christian Belief in an Embodied God,"" by David L. Paulsen which I linked to contained no less than 207 footnotes. Did you actually read it, or did you stop when you saw that it was published in BYU Studies Quarterly? Did you also notice that the other article by Paulsen which I cited was published in Harvard Theological Review? That should tell you that the guy's no dummy.      How do you spell ad hominem?      You write that Platonic ideas in Judeo Christianity go back to at least Philo who would have been contemporary with the early Christian Church, suggesting implicitly that the Church may have absorbed his Platonic views. That's extremely unlikely. Consider the following evidence, from Paulsen's article in BYU Studies Quarterly (pp. 45-47, 53).      (1) In his recently published study, Alon Goshen Gottstein claims: ""In all of rabbinic literature [covering both the tannaitic (70-200 AD) and amoraic (220-500 AD) periods] there is not a single statement that categorically denies that God has body or form."" (""The Body as Image of God in Rabbinic Literature,"" Harvard Theological Review 87 (1994): 172.)      (2) Scholar James Drummond admits that even as the Jews advanced theologically to a higher conception of God, ""we can hardly doubt that the mass of the people would be satisfied with [the scriptures'] literal meaning and that their idea of God was the purest anthropomorphism."" (Philo Judaeus; or, The Jewish-Alexandrian Philosophy in Its Development and Completion, 2 vols. London: Williams and Norgate, 1888, 1:135.)      (3) Regarding Philo, Paulsen writes (p. 45): ""Philo's views were not generally accepted by his mainstream Jewish contemporaries. However, Albinus, a second- century non-Christian and middle-Platonist, did follow Philo's lead and in turn greatly influenced Origen and later Christian thinkers."" For further information, he refers the curious reader to Grace Jantzen, ""Theological Tradition and Divine Incorporeality,"" God's World, God's Body, (London: Darton, Longman, and Todd, 1984) 21-35.

"Tom,   ""You seem to think that logic is some absolute supporting your prejudice""   Logic is a human convention, to which Aristotle was an early and major contributor.   Aquinas clearly valued logic and put a great deal of effort into an attempt at using logic to make a positive case for the necessity of a first mover, and therefore god.      Dr. Feser clearly values logic, so much so that some of his posts are deep dives into very finely specified nuances of logical minutia, which I greatly appreciate. He and I agree on little, but if we can both agree on a common language of logical communication then at least we have a common basis for constructive engagement.      If you do not value logic then there is no logical argument I can make that will even potentially form a basis for mutual understanding between us.      ""All bodies in temporal motion radiate energy as multi polar radiators and lose orbital motion, thus energy, and come to a natural state of rest.""   That is a version of Aristotelian misunderstanding, that when an object loses energy to an impeding medium and comes to a rest its motion is lost, and therefore, it is erroneously considered, given the fact that we observe motion generally, there must be a prime mover to keep it all moving.      The error Aristotle, Aquinas, Feser, you, and most of the good posters here make is that the energy lost from the slowing and stopping object is not lost in total, rather, the energy of motion is is conserved and is merely transferred.      For every object that slows and stops there is an equal energy of motion gained by other objects due to the conservation of energy. You may observe that an object comes to a rest, but what you are failing to realize is that other objects increase in their velocity by an amount equal to the observed loss.      This forms a system of universal perpetual motion, making a first mover unnecessary.      ""Nothing you say demonstrates that, should an orbit be sustained, it could not be by a prime mover. There is no inconsistency.""   The Fist Way is not an argument for consistency.      I can speculate that little angles nudge every particle in the universe along and they are all continuously battling little demons trying to slow them down, but the little angles typically win, and that is consistent with what we observe.      The First Way is an attempt to prove the necessity of a first mover, and in that attempt the First Way fails.      ""It _is_ in an impeding medium.""   No, all motion is in space. You are in space. The medium does not impede motion, rather, neighbors within the medium impede motion of one object by gaining motion for themselves. No net motion is lost.      ""Absent the impeding medium which removes energy from objects in motion, a continuing force would cause the speed to go to infinity. According to special relativity,""   According to special relativity the mass of an object increases as the speed of the accelerated object approaches c. Energy is not lost, it is gained by the object being accelerated , or gained by any other object the accelerated object loses energy to. E=mc^2 is an expression of the conservation of material.

"Allow me to try again, as evidently, I have not been clear enough or too fast in my considerations. The main point of the Bell inequality experiments is about non-commuting variables. You can measure the vertical spin of an electron, and you can measure the horizontal spin, but you cannot measure both at the same time (just as you cannot measure a particle's momentum and position simultaneously). The correlation is not about saying that if particle 1's spin is ""up"" in the vertical direction, then particle 2's spin must be ""down"" in the same direction. The correlation is about saying that once the spin of particle 1 has been measured in the vertical direction, it becomes impossible to measure the horizontal spin of particle 2, as if the two particles were one, even though they are spatially separated. As you know, the probability for the first particle to be ""up"" could be, for example, 50%, and choosing to measure it randomly in any direction should satisfy Bell's inequalities if the two particles were independent of each other. If Bell's inequalities are falsified, it would mean that particle 1 has ""informed"" particle 2 instantaneously that it has been measured vertically, so that the latter cannot be measured horizontally. Experiments conducted by Nobel prize winners in 2022, such as A. Aspect, have shown that this is exactly what happens. In other words, the two particles are actually the expression of the same quantum state and the spin property of that quantum state is non-local, and it is incorrect to assume that these two particles can be considered as two independent (quantum) states that need to transfer information to each other.",allow try evidently clear enough fast consideration main point bell inequality experiment non-commuting variable measure vertical spin electron measure horizontal spin can not measure time can not measure momentum position simultaneously correlation saying particle spin vertical direction particle spin must direction correlation saying spin particle measured vertical direction becomes impossible measure horizontal spin particle two particle one even though spatially separated know probability first particle could example choosing measure randomly direction satisfy inequality two particle independent inequality falsified would mean particle informed particle instantaneously measured vertically latter can not measured horizontally experiment conducted nobel prize winner aspect shown exactly happens word two particle actually expression quantum state spin property quantum state non-local incorrect assume two particle considered two independent quantum state need transfer information,feser,1666,0,1903

"There were, as this indicated, serious minds in the Church who affirmed the continuing validity of the premodern philosophical and theological worldview I was then questioning.

"Now, one point that some readers have made is that the word “heresy” was used in a more expansive way earlier in Church history than it is today. That is correct and important, and it is something [I have elsewhere emphasized myself](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2019/05/popes-heresy-and-papal- heresy.html). In modern canon law, heresy is “the obstinate denial or obstinate doubt after the reception of baptism of some truth which is to be believed by divine and Catholic faith.” Pope Honorius was definitely _not_ a heretic in that sense, both because there is no evidence of obstinacy on his part, and because a charitable reading of his problematic statements supports the judgment that he did not intend to undermine traditional teaching (even if his words inadvertently had that effect). There are also the related points that one could be a heretic in the _material_ sense of affirming something doctrinally erroneous, while not being a _formal_ heretic in the sense of persisting in the error even after being warned by ecclesiastical authority; and that whether some doctrine has actually been defined by the Church is relevant to whether it is “to be believed by divine and Catholic faith.”",one point reader made word “ heresy ” used expansive way earlier church history today correct important something elsewhere emphasized myselfhttpsedwardfeserblogspotcompopes-heresy-and-papal- heresyhtml modern canon law heresy “ the obstinate denial obstinate doubt reception baptism truth believed divine catholic faith ” pope honorius definitely heretic sense evidence obstinacy part charitable reading problematic statement support judgment intend undermine traditional teaching even word inadvertently effect also related point one could heretic material sense affirming something doctrinally erroneous formal heretic sense persisting error even warned ecclesiastical authority whether doctrine actually defined church relevant whether “ to believed divine catholic faith ”,feser,1204,0,1930

But in order for us to be able to understand it also as an efficient cause, it was fitting that it not occur too late in human history – that we be able to observe its effects in the foundation of the Church and spreading of the Gospel in the centuries after the time of Christ.

"Hi Tom Cohoe and grodrigues,      We seem to be talking at cross-purposes. What I'm talking about are the intrinsic properties of elementary particles (such as quarks and electrons). These do not change when particles are bound in a structure - be it a living human body or an inanimate chemical lattice. What changes, as you rightly point out, are the interactions between the particles and their surrounding environment - interactions which can be described by the Schroedinger wave equation that governs their wavefunctions. (Yes, I have studied the Schroedinger wave equation, although it was over 40 years ago.) The fact that elementary particles behave differently when in the neighborhood of other particles no more proves that they cease to be elementary particles and that their identity is subsumed within that of the body they comprise than the fact that cars in a traffic jam behave differently than cars on the open road proves that they thereby cease to be cars and that their identity is taken over by that of the traffic jam they comprise.      So when David Oderberg (who is a philosopher) writes that ""[t]he substantial forms of the particles exist virtually in the substances they constitute. In other words, the quark is ontologically dependent on the whole of which it is a part, but its causal powers persist, albeit in a way radically limited by the whole,"" I have to respectfully disagree. A bound quark is still a quark, and its causal powers, which derive from its intrinsic properties, are still intact. Putting it another way: we don't need to do biology in order to understand quarks, be they quarks inside a human body or outside.      Of course, as I mentioned earlier, particles themselves can be viewed as excitations of underlying fields, but that's another matter altogether, and one that's irrelevant to hylomorphism.      Re quantum indeterminacy: pardon my somewhat clumsy formulation, but I was alluding to the fact that the propositional distributive law, p and (q or r) = (p and q) or (p and r), doesn't appear to hold in the quantum realm. To be fair, this claim is contested - see this paper here, which appeals to Bohmian mechanics (which is itself a highly contentious interpretation of QM, as it posits hidden variables): https://www.mdpi.com/2624-960X/2/4/42/htm      My point was that whatever Aristotelian potency means, it certainly doesn't mean quantum fuzziness.

"1- I don't care about what is taught by the Church, so I'll ignore that;      2- I also don't care about what Scripture teaches;      3- Aren't you getting Essence and Existence confused with Form and Matter? Knowing whether a Tasmanian tiger exists or not is a matter of knowing whether it has Existence or not, not what its Matter is. Sure, the existence of an animal might require its material exemplification, but this is not the case with immaterial beings (such as souls, angels, God, or any other candidates). What you are pointing to is precisely the difference between Essence and Existence - that you can know what-a-thing-is without knowing that-a-thing-is. It's not the same as what form a thing has versus its material cause (which also could or could not exist). I don't know what you mean by ""Pure Existence"" being vague or not infinite but Aquinas has some pretty good arguments for why Pure Existence is infinite, divine, etc.      More importantly, why are you ignoring the entire rationale for Divine Simplicity? It seems to be a recurring thing among critics. You point apparent problems but then ignore the arguments given for simplicity.      I speak as a person who has no ulterior motives; I simply am convinced that the First Cause of all things must be absolutely simple. If it had parts, then it would be dependent upon those parts for its existence, and thus would not be perfectly independent. Yet cosmological arguments require a foundation that is entirely independent of anything, which just is necessary existence, unconditioned. A composite is always conditioned by its parts, its existence is always ""iffy"" and dependent on the parts. So if ""God"" had parts, the parts would be the First Principles, not the composite. And if you follow that along, you'll reach some really bad problems.   And if God had an accident distinct of himself (his essence), where would this accident come from? It can't come from the essence lest you accept the precedence of a perfectly simple Essence which is the source of all things, which is what you're trying to avoid. But there is nowhere for the accident to come from, then, and being an accident, it cannot exist ""by its own (non- substantial, hence conditioned and dependent) nature"". You know classical authors reflected a lot on these matters and didn't just adopt Divine Simplicity because of church teaching, right?      4- And yet the same happens with libertarian freedom for us as well. Before you make your choice, there is a point in which there is no difference in your properties between world 1 (where you go on to choose X) and world 2 (where you go on to not choose X). So do you reject libertarian free will for humans too? Since I accept LFW, I already cannot accept that objection.      If I had to accept it, though, I would rather embrace necessitarian emanationism or optimism etc. than reject Simplicity, speaking for myself.      5- This objection wouldn't just cut against Divine Simplicity; it would also cut against creation being the result of a free choice, given what I said in 4. And you seem to be presupposing that an explanans must determine the explanandum, which is very doubtful (especially if it would cost us standard free will explanations);      6- Again, don't care about what Scripture says in philosophical matters (philosophy and rational argument always comes first to me) but Divine Simplicity isn't incompatible with God being personal. God *is* personal, and literally so, since he is the ultimate source of personhood. He's just eminently personal by virtue of a greater perfection (a single one) which includes the actualities of all others in a unified way.",- care taught church ignore - also care scripture teach - getting essence existence confused form matter knowing whether tasmanian tiger exists matter knowing whether existence matter sure existence animal might require material exemplification case immaterial being soul angel god candidate pointing precisely difference essence existence - know what-a-thing-is without knowing that-a-thing-is form thing versus material cause also could could exist know mean pure existence vague infinite aquinas pretty good argument pure existence infinite divine etc importantly ignoring entire rationale divine simplicity seems recurring thing among critic point apparent problem ignore argument given simplicity speak person ulterior motif simply convinced first cause thing must absolutely simple part would dependent upon part existence thus would perfectly independent yet cosmological argument require foundation entirely independent anything necessary existence unconditioned composite always conditioned part existence always iffy dependent part god part part would first principle composite follow along reach really bad problem god accident distinct essence would accident come come essence lest accept precedence perfectly simple essence source thing trying avoid nowhere accident come accident can not exist non- substantial hence conditioned dependent nature know classical author reflected lot matter adopt divine simplicity church teaching right - yet happens libertarian freedom u well make choice point difference property world go choose x world go choose x reject libertarian free human since accept lfw already can not accept objection accept though would rather embrace necessitarian emanationism optimism etc reject simplicity speaking - objection cut divine simplicity would also cut creation result free choice given said seem presupposing explanans must determine explanandum doubtful especially would cost u standard free explanation - care scripture say philosophical matter philosophy rational argument always come first divine simplicity incompatible god personal god personal literally since ultimate source personhood eminently personal virtue greater perfection single one includes actuality others unified way,feser,3680,0,1947

"@bmiller: “ Are you saying the physical properties of a particle just are ""the particle""? Or both are either are an image (particle detectors take pictures?) of a process (aren't processes actions that things undergo?).”      The physical properties we associate with the particle are only ever seen as part of an observation or measurement, There is no reason to think that photons are little balls flying through space. It’s only when the wave interacts with an electron in an atom (whether a detector or the absorbing material in the photoelectric effect) that the ‘discrete particle’ properties appear. The electron itself is of course a wave, in this case constrained by it’s position in the atom (and by mass) . There are no local, physical properties of a photon except in these interactions. The wave function is always spread out across space, with certain constraints that determine the probability it will interact at any particular opportunity.      It may help (or not!) to consider that from the perspective of the photon, there is no space or time. Light does however have entanglements in space and time, and the only time these entanglements result in any physical signs is a specific type of entanglement that we call a measurement, or what is sometimes called the ‘collapse of the wave function’. In some ways you could say that it’s mass and time and space that are the really weird things, but of course we tend to start from the position that these are the obvious things we take for granted.      “Regarding Elvis. Some people have the impression that QM implies that Elvis does not exist until someone takes his picture.”      Yes and this is the natural conclusion if your ontology is that physical properties are the foundation of reality, aka materialism. If you only have the ontological horizontal, then the foundations of local reality tend to fall apart with QM.

When a moving object, say, a billiard ball, slows and stops it's motion is not lost, as Aristotle supposed, rather, it's kinetic energy of motion is transferred to kinetic energy of the surrounding environment, some of which goes to heating up the surrounding air. That effect is too small and too diffuse to be easily detected without instruments, so Aristotle did not realize this fact.      Using Aristotelian terminology and concepts for heat is hopeless, he got it wrong.

"As long as I have been following the issue of papal fallibility regarding non- ex-cathedra statements, and the allied question of how to understand the obligation of ""religious submission"" to the non-infallible teachings of the magisterium, I have been hearing of that side-bar comment about the Holy Spirit protecting the pope from teaching _error which is destructive to souls._      And as long as I have heard it, I have wondered at its validity, or even its _meaning_ in the Catholic context. First of all, we ONLY talking about papal teaching on _faith and morals_ , and not on science, the weather, sports teams, and the best cologne. And once you have limited it to matters of faith and morals, **on what basis could you EVER prove a matter is NOT a matter that could, (if error were thought true) lead to destruction of souls**? The whole point of what God revealed to us through the Bible and Tradition is that _this is what we need for salvation_. God did not reveal everything, and in some parts more or less expressly said ""I'm not telling you that, you don't need to know"". But ""need to know"" includes, if anything, what we need for salvation. So, if it's something that the Church CAN testify to as being revealed through Scripture and Tradition, then (arguably), it is or may be needed for salvation, and it's covered by protection from ""error which is destructive to souls.""      I am not at all sure the qualifier does, or is even meant to, narrow the sense of papal teachings that receive protection from error to some lesser subset than ""on faith and morals"" so that popes might (in theory) err on some matter but that's OK but an error in that matter is ""not destructive of souls"".

"Second, as noted by John Chapman (whose book on Honorius I discussed in my previous post), the Church has long held that “an error which is not resisted is approved; a truth which is not defended is suppressed” (in the words of Honorius’s predecessor Pope Felix III). It is possible to be guilty of teaching doctrinal error by implication, when the context demands that a certain truth needs to be explicitly affirmed and instead one not only fails to do so but speaks in an ambiguous way that gives the appearance of approving the error. And that is exactly what Honorius did. The Monothelite error was being put forward, and he not only did not clearly condemn it but _seemed_ to be saying that it could be accepted. The suggestion that his words can be given a more charitable reading (as I agree they can) is relevant to his personal culpability, but it is not relevant to the question of the doctrinal soundness of the words themselves, and as Chapman emphasizes, in a context like this it is the words that matter.",second noted john chapman whose book honorius discussed previous post church long held “ an error resisted approved truth defended suppressed ” word predecessor pope felix iii possible guilty teaching doctrinal error implication context demand certain truth need explicitly affirmed instead one fails speaks ambiguous way give appearance approving error exactly honorius monothelite error put forward clearly condemn seemed saying could accepted suggestion word given charitable reading agree relevant personal culpability relevant question doctrinal soundness word chapman emphasizes context like word matter,feser,1020,0,1964

"This is a new idea that I had not heard of. And I admit that there's room for more understanding, but I would hazard this:      By ""living uterus donation"" do you mean Jane, who is healthy, giving over her uterus to Sally, whose uterus is damaged and cannot be healed, so that Sally can conceive a and bear a child?      If we assume that Jane is not offering her uterus _in order to avoid conceiving_ , the contraceptive aspect of the perverted faculty argument is not applicable. If, for example, Jane is single and expects to stay that way, and stably has not been engaging in sexual relations, she can be presumed not to enter into this for contraceptive reasons. She is not perverting her faculty of reproduction.      Nor is Sally perverting her faculty of reproduction: her faculty is being impeded by a damaged organ, which (apparently) can be worked around by medical means. So far as ""faculty"" arguments go, this is morally licit.      The real weight of the moral difficulty is in Jane effectively maiming herself: it is not _generally_ reasonable to take away a functioning major body part. However, the ""generally"" I added there does imply reservations on how far that applies: it is (by most ethicists) considered moral for a person to donate one of his 2 kidneys to another whose kidneys have failed. This is even laudable: the donor can (for the most part) ""get by"" on one kidney - though they will live a life of increased risk, because they no longer have a ""back-up"" kidney to take over if one is not functioning.      Arguably, Jane can use the same approach to justify donating her uterus to a woman whose own uterus is damaged: if Jane isn't going to ""use it"", she can offer its use to another. However, I see potential quagmires here, and I don't think it's that simple. On the one hand, if Jane is single, on what basis is she _certain_ she will not marry? If she is married, on what basis is she able to definitively decide she won't be ""needing"" that uterus any more? (On the other hand, what if Jane has taken permanent vows of celibacy in a monastic order, and knows she will not be using her reproductive faculties for reproduction?)      Secondly, the reproductive organs are highly inter-related, and it is absolutely _not_ a given that ""because Jane won't be using the organs for reproduction"" doesn't altogether imply the organs have no health function in the body. This is manifestly true of the ovaries, and hormonal activity that regulates tons of other body functions than JUST reproduction. I don't have any knowledge of whether the uterus, like the ovaries, is involved in other activities for health. I suspect that (a) the medical system claims those health risks are minimal, and (b) that they _may_ be oversimplifying the case in saying so, but I don't actually know.      As to being involved in ""the system"": since there seems (to me, indicated above) that there is a plausible argument that the underlying donative action is morally licit _in some cases_ , it comes down to a prudential judgment whether the overall activity is _nearly always_ a donation precisely because Jane wants to avoid the possibility of pregnancy, i.e. whether working for it is supporting something that almost always is being done immorally, or not. If it is nearly always being done immorally with a contraceptive intent, it might be imprudent to _support_ the medical practice by aiding the research. If _not_ , i.e. if there seem to be plenty of cases (even if still in the minority) that are not donations for contraceptive intentions, then I think you can use a _general presumption_ of moral licitness of the individual cases, and this would seem to permit being involved in ""the system"" of medical support / research in the activity. But that's just my opinion.",new idea heard admit room understanding would hazard living uterus donation mean jane healthy giving uterus sally whose uterus damaged can not healed sally conceive bear child assume jane offering uterus order avoid conceiving contraceptive aspect perverted faculty argument applicable example jane single expects stay way stably engaging sexual relation presumed enter contraceptive reason perverting faculty reproduction sally perverting faculty reproduction faculty impeded damaged organ apparently worked around medical mean far faculty argument go morally licit real weight moral difficulty jane effectively maiming generally reasonable take away functioning major body part however generally added imply reservation far applies ethicist considered moral person donate one kidney another whose kidney failed even laudable donor part get one kidney - though live life increased risk longer back-up kidney take one functioning arguably jane use approach justify donating uterus woman whose uterus damaged jane going use offer use another however see potential quagmire think simple one hand jane single basis certain marry married basis able definitively decide needing uterus hand jane taken permanent vow celibacy monastic order know using reproductive faculty reproduction secondly reproductive organ highly inter-related absolutely given jane using organ reproduction altogether imply organ health function body manifestly true ovary hormonal activity regulates ton body function reproduction knowledge whether uterus like ovary involved activity health suspect medical system claim health risk minimal b may oversimplifying case saying actually know involved system since seems indicated plausible argument underlying donative action morally licit case come prudential judgment whether overall activity nearly always donation precisely jane want avoid possibility pregnancy ie whether working supporting something almost always done immorally nearly always done immorally contraceptive intent might imprudent support medical practice aiding research ie seem plenty case even still minority donation contraceptive intention think use general presumption moral licitness individual case would seem permit involved system medical support research activity opinion,feser,3791,0,1966

Maybe this is all not reasonably ""worth"" the financial costs to the system of two such heavily invasive procedures with ongoing risks (e.g. immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection), but that's also probably not a hill to die on: if Sally has the money for whatever reason, spending it to produce a child ""by natural means"" (so to speak) is not, _per se_ , a wrongful use of wealth.

"Perhaps. But whatever it is, I take it as absurd to suggest one could have epistemic certainty about a religion. That can't work.      And I do think a lot of talk about faith is confused. The only definition that seems to make more sense to me is something like ""trust in what one cannot see"" or more broadly trust in what one doesn't know by himself - a knowledge by trust, such as when I know something about physics because some expert physicists have assured me even though I never demonstrated it for myself or did any experiments about it.

"I haven't worked through all of this, but it seems to me that the PoE defense, that God has no moral duties and owes us nothing, is a red herring. If God is omnibenevolent, then wouldn't God act, not out of duty, but simply out of the overflow of His benevolence? Wouldn't God succour the afflicted, not out of some obligation to creatures, but simply because it's His nature? Someone who loves, say, a child or spouse in need, ideally doesn't say, Well, I guess I am obligated to help out right now. Doesn't that person act out of benevolence alone-- if that person exemplifies the ideal? And God is the supreme beyond every series.      So I am thinking the Brian Davies approach conceives of a rather Scrooge-like God. I should think that perfect love goes beyond what is owed.      The force of the evidential PoE, then, doesn't come from a claim that God owes moral duties. It comes from looking around at the s--t that happens and asking, would a benevolent AND omnipotent agent allow this, even if not obligated to stop it, simply because a benevolent nature issues in benevolent, willing acts?",worked seems poe defense god moral duty owes u nothing red herring god omnibenevolent god act duty simply overflow benevolence god succour afflicted obligation creature simply nature someone love say child spouse need ideally say well guess obligated help right person act benevolence alone -- person exemplifies ideal god supreme beyond every series thinking brian davy approach conceives rather scrooge-like god think perfect love go beyond owed force evidential poe come claim god owes moral duty come looking around s -- t happens asking would benevolent omnipotent agent allow even obligated stop simply benevolent nature issue benevolent willing act,feser,1101,0,1989

"@Walter, you write:       _""Necessary"" means ""existing in every possible world"". ""Contingent"" means ""existing in at least one but not all possible worlds"".   If this particular universe exists in every possible world, as you seem to believe, then this universe is necessary, even if it is dependent on God's creation. You should not confuse ""contingent"" with ""dependent""._      Then my assumption was correct. You are collapsing modes into necessity, but you are again failing to take into account the different senses of necessity. This is something that Aquinas foresaw and addressed. Creation is necessary because God wills it, but its necessity is _always_ a conditional one because its cause is extrinsic. And since it can never be anything other than a hypothetical necessity, it can never collapse into absolute necessity. God is necessary in Himself whereas creation is necessary in God. That is true in this world and in any other world. So long as God is the creator, whatever He creates is always conditioned on His efficient cause. Thus, modal collapse is impossible.       _I acknowledge that God can still be free in some way because some people define freedom as the ability to do what is in your nature. If there is only one thing in my nature, then , by that definition, I am still free if I do that thing.   Likewise, if God can, because of his essentially loving nature, only create one universe, then God is free in the sense that he has the 'power' to create another one but, due to His nature will never use that power._      I am glad to see that we agree, at least in a sense, that God is free. I will only repeat what I stated above that since God is perfect, His willing cannot be less than perfect. It is therefore incoherent to assert God’s willing something other than what His perfect will has decreed. One might as well ask whether God can make a rock too heavy for Him to lift—which is to ask whether God can cease being God in order to prove that He is God. So, if the universe is the result of God’s decree, then its existence is in accordance with His perfect will. There is thus no possible world where anything less than God’s perfect will can obtain.",walter write necessary mean existing every possible world contingent mean existing least one possible world particular universe exists every possible world seem believe universe necessary even dependent creation confuse contingent dependent assumption correct collapsing mode necessity failing take account different sens necessity something aquinas foresaw addressed creation necessary god will necessity always conditional one cause extrinsic since never anything hypothetical necessity never collapse absolute necessity god necessary whereas creation necessary god true world world long god creator whatever creates always conditioned efficient cause thus modal collapse impossible acknowledge god still free way people define freedom ability nature one thing nature definition still free thing likewise god essentially loving nature create one universe god free sense power create another one due nature never use power glad see agree least sense god free repeat stated since god perfect willing can not le perfect therefore incoherent assert willing something perfect decreed one might well ask whether god make rock heavy lift—which ask whether god cease god order prove god universe result decree existence accordance perfect thus possible world anything le perfect obtain,feser,2188,0,1992

"@Stardusty,      Some years ago Dennis Bonnette on Strange Notions put up a post that argued to a first mover from a body's change of location. If I capture Bonnette's meaning right, he argued so:   body B in linear locomotion at velocity V exists/is at location L in relation to bodies C and D at time T, and B exists/is at V at L1 in relation to C and D at T1.   Therefore B existed at L1 potentially at T but exists at L1 actually at T1.   Therefore B underwent a transition from potentiality to actuality under the category of location although not under the category that comprises its velocity.   But transition from potentiality to actuality under ANY category is motion.   But a substance existing potentially under some category does not have the power to give itself actual existence/being under the given category, by the principle of proportionate causality - i.e. something cannot give what it does not have. In this example, B doesn't have existence at L1 at T, so it can't be the cause of its own existence at L1 at T1.   Therefore something else, which has the power to confer location at L1, must bring B from potential existence at L1 to actual existence at L1 - since B can't effect that change/motion itself.      Therefore even cases of change of location by a body moving at constant velocity are cases of ""motion,"" and require a prior mover. Therefore attacks on Aristotelian/Thomistic explanations of locomotion fail to undermine the First Way. ANY change requires a changer that is already actual (or that is so virtually; God is not undergoing locomotion but has the power/virtue to effect locomotion).      IOW change of position is a ""new existence;"" B is not as it was before.      https://strangenotions.com/how-new-existence-implies-god/      Do you have views about this argument?

"I would emphasize a further point. It is commonly assumed that scientific theory gives us a richer and more accurate representation of the world than common sense does, and indeed ought to replace the commonsense description of phenomena. But as Cartwright’s argument indicates, this is the reverse of the truth. For one thing, scientific theory in fact cannot even be given a determinate interpretation without some connection to the ordinary linguistic usage from which its concepts ultimately derive, and the concrete applications to which theory is put. For another thing, what theory describes are really only abstract features of the world of common experience rather than that world in all its rich complexity. That doesn’t necessarily entail that scientific theory should be given an instrumentalist rather than realist interpretation. But it does support the epistemic structural realist view that, while what theory describes is really there in nature, it is very far from capturing everything that is there in nature. (See _Aristotle’s Revenge_ for detailed exposition and defense of this view.)",would emphasize point commonly assumed scientific theory give u richer accurate representation world common sense indeed ought replace commonsense description phenomenon argument indicates reverse truth one thing scientific theory fact can not even given determinate interpretation without connection ordinary linguistic usage concept ultimately derive concrete application theory put another thing theory describes really abstract feature world common experience rather world rich complexity necessarily entail scientific theory given instrumentalist rather realist interpretation support epistemic structural realist view theory describes really nature far capturing everything nature see revenge detailed exposition defense view,feser,1106,0,2000

"@bmiller:      BTW we exchanged views years ago over on the classical theism forum, and I hadn't seen you ""around"" online until recently. I may have missed many of your posts since then.

I'm talking about a property of the proposition, such that there are no rational grounds on which P can be falsified. For example, we know with certitude that A = A, because that proposition is analytic. There are no rational grounds for proving it false. Whether you or I believe that A = A, or whether one of us believes it more strongly than the other, has to do with our individual intellectual biographies and not to do with the epistemic property of objective certitude that attaches to the belief and not to the believer.      Does this make sense?

"@Infinite Growth, there's that ignorant and vicious trope again. I'll bite, though this is a digression as my point was to show that even much more tangible claims toward restitution remain unaddressed if we wish to talk restitution.      Were there Poles who committed crimes during WWII, who went along with Nazi, or Soviet, crimes? Obviously. I feel silly even having to state the obvious because this is something that follows not from empirical fact, but from the general proposition that the moral status of the actions of individuals during wartime does not conform strictly to the divide of the front line. There were righteous Germans and righteous Russians and wicked Poles. So what? Judas betrayed Christ, but the Apostles on the whole or as a corporate body were not agents of the Sanhedrin. We can say the same about Jews who betrayed both their fellow Jews and committed crimes against gentile Poles, but we rarely talk about those, so why the special pleading here?      As a matter of empirical fact, we must remember things like:      1\. The Polish state never collaborated with the Nazis. Compare that with other European governments. This refusal to collaborate, and the formation of Europe's largest resistance, happened at enormous cost. This, in addition to Nazi crimes against the populace.   2\. Even the number of only those Poles recognized by Yad Vashem outstrips the combined number of people recognized from all other nations combined. Proportion and scale matter.   3\. The penalties for aiding Jews were uniquely and incomparably severe in Poland (involving the execution of the person aiding, his family, maybe neighbors, etc). And yet, point (2).   4\. Poland was home to something like 80% of world Jewry at the time of the war and the majority of the world's Jews for centuries. Any occurrence of antipathy (and don't forget Jewish bigotry, which did exist) at the time of the war was driven by economic, but also cultural, political, social, and historical factors, not racial hatred. That is, there was no impulse to exterminate any group and any crimes committed were isolated incidents of criminal opportunism taken during the chaos of wartime, not systematic programs of liquidation or some broad expression of national hatred. There were also incidents where Poles were forced under threat of death to participate in Nazi operations, incidents that some Jewish authors have grotesquely misrepresented either maliciously or through incompetence (e.g., Jan Gross).

And if Almighty God exists, man can't prevent Him from working, whether he works through miscarriages or abortions, if He wants an unborn baby to die, it dies. But that's all there is to it.

"@ Tadeo,      I cannot speak for Ed, but I was not arguing for or against natural selection per se. I disentangle truth and natural selection, as science, through my idea that, since a random sequence is a valid image of God, and since we know through quantum mechanics that there is such a thing as a random sequence, a random sequence, being without rules, is a very simple image of God, who also is without rules.      But God is greater than this or any other image, and is in no way limited by this image. So questions about consciousness do not restrict this image. What it is useful for, to we humans, is to show that we cannot calculate, with our mathematical science, what God's acts will be or are, since we cannot calculate a number (a sequence) whose digits are without a rule (are random), and, since God is truth, this separates truth from natural selection. In short, it is beyond our understanding (at least for me) to know whether natural selection is actual science, although as a theory of science, as Ed said in the video, (""natural selection favors fitness"") it explains adaption to the environment of survivors.      I can't see how your question can give a different answer without assumption, so I can't see it as a real question because the answer is either beyond our understanding, or follows from the arbitrary assumptions in its formulation. I suppose this is a parallel to Chomsky's claim that some questions are not real questions (but I am no fan of Chomsky).      My answer follows from my belief in God as truth.

"ficino4ml,      Of course the Catholic Church declares that there are certain things that can be known with certitude but I as I recall those things are by revelation, not necessarily by reason. Reason only gets one so far, but it cannot conflict with revelation.      Now of course if you don't believe in revelation you won't believe what Catholicism has to say anyway.

" _Socialism is not a theory of governmental ownership. It is a theory of workers' ownership. That is why there are Catholic socialists._      I don't think that's actually true. Socialism per se implies that the means of production are owned not by individuals but by larger entities, and this is enforced by the state. Thus the state may not _directly claim_ to be ""the owner"", but it is always choosing who governs the use of the tools of production. And choosing who manages / directs the stuff is one of the major aspects of ownership.      There is nothing inherent in ""workers' ownership"" that implies that it cannot take place in various kinds of systems, including capitalism: workers can own the corporation they work at by owning shares in it. There are worker-owned corporations now, in our system. (And naturally, nearly a great many sole proprietorships are owned by the initial worker, when it first gets going.) And if workers' ownership is compatible with capitalism, then necessarily that's not the **distinguishing characteristic** of socialism.",socialism theory governmental ownership theory ownership catholic socialist think actually true socialism per se implies mean production owned individual larger entity enforced state thus state may directly claim owner always choosing governs use tool production choosing manages directs stuff one major aspect ownership nothing inherent worker ownership implies can not take place various kind system including capitalism worker corporation work owning share worker-owned corporation system naturally nearly great many sole proprietorship owned initial worker first get going ownership compatible capitalism necessarily distinguishing characteristic socialism,feser,1063,0,2021

"@ StardustyPsyche,      In Summa Theologiae, Part 1, Question 2, Aquinas ends his ""first way"" with the words ""and this everyone understands to be God."" He argues that everything is moved by something else. That is true, Gravity and other forces cause the motion of things. Things in motion radiate their energy, either to infinity or to other objects, so you can say that space is a resistive medium. You take a position that amounts to ""nothing is lost"" which is, effectively, that ""everything is one thing"", an absurdity. Two apples forced apart by a hand that takes them from a basket and throws one away will return to the other apple by gravity, even though a light beam initiated on the same trajectory as the tossed apple will not return. The medium, through gravity, resists the motion of the apple and its energy, measured from the point of view of the apple in the basket, is radiated into space which is how space is a resistive medium. Of course, the apple is likely to collide with something else before it can return to the basket, in which case energy will be radiated into space from the collision, as extensively discussed previously.      You may not wish space to be a resistive medium, but that does not make it so.      You claimed that Aristotle thought that a force applied to an object forever would cause it to move infinitely fast, but this is correct. You have repeatedly ignored this consequence of relativity, so your claim about Aristotle was false.      I cannot take your ""teaching"" seriously at all.

I'm sorry if the topic/questions that I put on the table were repetitive or lame. Here in Brazil none of my friends really like to talk about that and don't care that much and I can say the same thing about our philosophers - they're a bunch of commies and half-baked intellectuals when it comes to anything that detours from politics that they ''know a lot''. In short, I don't have anyone to talk about that kind of thing. There are a lot of other questions that I can't even find materials to work with (all I have is some of Ed's books and the articles that David Oderberg gives for free on his website, and still there are a lot of things that I just can't understand right because it's hard to grasp). So I just want to say that I appreciate a lot of you guys time and effort - that means a lot to me.      The topic of natural selection and evolution generally opens up a lot of other questions - questions that mere biologists, say, can't answer in principle. The examples that I brought up about counting cells as individuals it's something that was really puzzling me. Of course, as I said I think that's insane. If cells we're conjoined to survive in the first place why do a lot of them have to die every day for the sake of others if the 'plan' was just for the single cell to survive in the first place? Why do we have apoptosis and the like? Or worse, like I said some comments ago replying to Tom, why do the 'true individuals' (the cells) come to form up 'the illusion' of a single individual? It means that the dog we see every day that 'seems' to rely on and works in unity with his own parts as a single thing to chase down the bikers across the street is just an aggregate of individual cells. That's not just disturbing I think that it's evil to think something like that.      As you guys can see I'm not a pro in biology. That's why I rely so much on the ''armchair'' philosophy. I can see that it is problematic to say that cells are individuals but I don't have a 'biological argument' (whatever that means) to affirm that. But the point is what is the motivation behind that 'science guys' to affirm something bizarre as that? That's something we should repeal because a lot of people just buy these ideas without even thinking about it.",hey uncommon hope trip went well endosymbiosis opinion powerful argument favor a-thomism mechanistic evolution like point well elaborated worked really well concept prime matter potentiality hidden btw want thank attention far tom sorry topicquestions put table repetitive lame brazil none friend really like talk care much say thing philosopher - bunch commie half-baked intellectual come anything detour politics know short anyone talk kind thing lot question even find material work book article david oderberg give free website still lot thing understand right hard grasp want say appreciate lot guy time effort - mean lot topic natural selection evolution generally open lot question - question mere biologist say answer principle example brought counting cell individual something really puzzling course said think insane cell conjoined survive first place lot die every day sake others plan single cell survive first place apoptosis like worse like said comment ago replying tom true cell come form single individual mean dog see every day seems rely work unity part single thing chase bikers across street aggregate individual cell disturbing think evil think something like guy see pro biology rely much armchair philosophy see problematic say cell individual biological whatever mean affirm point motivation behind science affirm something bizarre something repeal lot people buy idea without even thinking,feser,2653,0,2034

Gensler finds Aquinas' ""Five Ways"" and other classical theist arguments wanting, although he doesn't elaborate much on why.

" **We Catholics reject Calvinism. I am thinking maybe you are channeling that and not Thomism?**      From what I studied, Thomism and Calvinism differ only on these three points:      1\.

Calvinists would say G-d caused both.      2\. Whether G-d only named the names of the elect when He was dying on the cross. Calvinists regard it as blasphemous to say that a creature's free will can overpower Christ's sacrifice and thereby nullify it, so they see his dying as being limited in scope, and that for the reprobate it is as if Christ is an abstract Heavenly being (kind of like ""The Angel of the L-rd"" of the Hebrew Bible) who never became man (but will appear as the judge of the reprobate on the Great White Throne Judgment).      3\. Whether man is capable of doing any good by his own power. Thomists say yes, but natural goodness doesn't merit any kind of Heavenly reward.

"Hi Norm,   Much respect to you, and while I agree that you could take Dr. Feser's ending in that way, before I read your post I took it as meaning that the Church's apostolic and papal offices would continue to be guided by the Holy Spirit, both in teaching truth and in refuting heretics, be they popes or no.   Additionally, I disagree that it is not healthy to desire other's punishment. Obviously, bloodthirstiness (of a physical or spiritual nature) is incorrect, the desire to have punishment where perhaps a lighter sentence would do, but that is merely one end of the bookends of virtue. Justice may require such harsh punishments, but it may not necessarily. C.S. Lewis wrote on this in his book ""Mere Christianity,"" with the example of a man who cheats and lies his way through life without any consideration for others' welfare, and he challenges the reader not to have a desire that the flag should be planted in that rebellious soul, which is just a healthy manifestation of justice. I'm not trying to equate Honorius to that, only to show that a desire for justice and retributive punishment isn't in itself a wrong, even if the judgment is harsh, and I think that you would agree that misleading souls from salvation is a particularly heinous crime.

"@ Walter Van den Acker,      ""it is possible to inevitably choose something?""      Yes Walter. In the temporal paradise nothing would end it except a voluntary exit (freely choosing to turn away from the presence of God). So an infinitude of time was available, unmarred by fear, aging, or death.      Now let us look at the simple model of human free will in time (in the temporal paradise) - an infinite sequence of unbiased bits, in which lies all possible intelligible choices encoded one way or other (you, Walter, can choose any encoding method subject to finite computation).      To be unbiased, the infinite sequence would have to contain, as a subsequence, the choice to turn away from God (exit paradise). If the infinite sequence did not contain the choice as a subsequence, the infinite sequence would not be an unbiased random sequence and it would not be simple but would be complex.      So the free choice to turn from God, given endless time, is inevitable.      ""I suppose that makes sense to someone who treats logic (and God) as contingent.""

"Thank you for this much needed and helpful post.      @Infinite Growth:      St. Paul did not forbid all judgement. If he did, he would not have written in 1 Corinthians 5:3, ""For I, on my part, thought absent in body but present in spirit have already judged him who has so so committed this, as though I were present.""      St. Paul is referred to a man who is sleeping with his father's wife whom the Corinthians have not rebuked out of a disordered tolerance that is so well described in Feser's post above.      Some of the distinctions in the post that are also found in St. Thomas are helpful to determine in what conditions a judgement can be made without being rash. One important distinction is between an exterior act (someone's actions which we can see) and an interior act (an inward intention which only God can see). You can judge an act and recognize that it is wrong without attributing to the person malice. The person may be acting wrongly out of ignorance and this is significantly less culpable than malice. In that instance, you could approach someone calmly and explain to them why the exterior act was not moral. This would be an act of mercy that the Church calls ""Instructing the ignorant."" Again you can do this without assuming that the person is either malicious or an imbecile. In fact, to instruct someone actually presumes goodwill. It presumes that they care about the truth and that if you take the time to explain the truth, that they will be inclined to follow it.      So, we have to make distinctions about what being judged and this can help us from making assumptions about intentions which we cannot be sure of without knowing someone's character and habits. This does not prevent us from judging the exterior acts of anyone even if we don't know them. Nor does it prevent us from assessing their assertions even if we don't know them.      It is also important to highlight that we can get to know someone's character and can make judgement's on that.

"Walter      ""Of course there is a difference in my intrinsic properties between w1 and w2. Otherwise there is no reason why I choose X over ~X.   The cause of my choosing X in w1 is me with my intention to choose X, which is an intrinsic property.   You are describing a random process instead of a choice.""      No, Walter, there is no intrinsic difference if LFW is true, and this is precisely how there can be a libertarian free choice. Otherwise the presence of you + the intention would determine the resulting action and we would no longer have libertarian freedom. If the cause were you and the intention, then in order to preserve libertarian freedom you would have to cause your intention. But then to cause your intention you would end up in an infinite regress, unless you accept that you at t in state S can cause Intention (what it does in w1) or not cause it (what it does in w2). In other words: there is no difference in intrinsic properties in the agent in worlds 1 and 2, and yet the agent can cause X or ~X. See? That's my point.      There is literally no difference between humans and God when it comes to this weird aspect of libertarian freedom. For determinism to be avoided, it must be the case that someone at t in state S can cause both X or ~X. For our libertarian choice of X, there is a time t which is the earliest time with the property that after t it is no longer causally possible for us to choose ~X instead. How else do you think libertarian freedom could work, without determinism? If the choice follows a difference in intrinsic properties, then the choice would be determined by such a difference and thus would no longer be libertarian, lest we cause the difference in properties (the intention, say), but then the same problem would reappear.      You say that this is ""random"". That is a common accusation by those who *reject* libertarian freedom. I do not accept that it is random; I believe libertarian choice is a sui generis category that is neither random nor deterministic, but that is beside the point. My response was that the ""problem"" Vincent was pointing out doesn't just affect Divine Simplicity, but also libertarian freedom for humans. It is THE SAME THING for us. The issue there doesn't lie with classical theism, but LFW; LFW by itself requires that an agent can be able to (non-randomly) bring about different effects without there being any change in the intrinsic properties of the agent when it is choosing.      So if you have a problem with God choosing to cause different things without requiring any difference in intrinsic properties as a condition for that, you should also have a problem with libertarian freedom for humans. Which you probably do (you probably do not accept LFW). Vincent however does presumably accept LFW, so he has to choose between rejecting LFW altogether or dropping that objection.      The only difference between us and God in this case is you could argue that our intrinsic properties change *after* we have CHOSEN (not when we are choosING). But so what? It is not even clear to me that we must change intrinsically after we have chosen; why insist that this must happen universally, even with God? It would still be the case that for a libertarian free choice to be made, the cause need not incur in change, since the cause can indeed, under the same exact intrinsic properties, bring about different effects. So the objection against God's choosing is worthless.      One could go on to complain about God's contingent knowledge of what he in fact chose (again, a matter of what could change AFTER a choice), but that is a different objection - the one that pertains to God's contingent knowledge.

"Hey, Tom!      Thanks for answering me!      ""Even if you want to suggest that evolution is a good explanation for why we have such a feature, that itself is a pretty bad explanation for the feature itself.""      I don't want to suggest that evolution is a good explanation for the phenomena, I just asked what can we say in response to that - on a philosophical level. Because these guys I quoted use some energy trying to explain features, functions, etc. based on evolution and I wish to know how to prove on philosophical grounds why appealing to that is wrong.      In what follows, I will try to give some background.      ""In other words, how do you know that natural selection is blind, other than by assuming it, in which case there is nothing that you can say? But there is a lot of randomness in the environment in which natural selection operates.""      I'm not advocating that it's blind or not. I was quoting Ed - if I get him right anyway - on his answer to Ben Shapiro in this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FvYwpyFbIQ). You can see the specific question that Ben is formulating at 39:57 and Ed's response in the following minutes (but I would suggest that you watch the whole video).      Now, back to Ed's response - again, if I get him correctly - he's not arguing against Natural Selection blindness, he's saying Natural Selection could not explain why the human mind is directed at truth (it is really important to note that he's talking about TRUTH directness, not just any other feature in the present case) and I agree with him (because just like he said, natural selection explains fitness and passing genes). And it's important to note too the fact that he was presupposing that it was true when he formulated the argument - not because he may agree with it or not - but because its trueness or not had nothing to do to the point that he was making (again, he said that natural selection explains fitness, etc. and that's not related with the mind directedness for truth per see).      So, now that I made this background to avoid any misunderstandings what I'm trying to ask is: could we make a similar answer disentangling body unity and evolution or natural selection claims?      I do not have any problem with evolution at all. I was just trying to say that someone could conflate two problems (evolution on one side and unity and substantial form on the other).      For example: if someone says that our unity is caused by ""an evolutionary process that co-opted our cells to do what they do now'' someone, plausibly, may think that our unity is just an accidental one.      Personally, I don't think that's true - I think that's insane - but some people believe this. But I can't just say that that's insane - that would beg the question. Instead, I would have to argue philosophically to show that. And that's what I'm trying to say: these two problems i.e the unity substance's (or we can think of its organs functions related to each other as one indivisible unity) and natural selection or evolution could have nothing to do with it each other - but they might seem at least to be related and someone might argue something like the example I presented. That's why I'm asking Ed if we could (or how to) disentangle the two (like in the same way when he was explaining why truth per se has nothing to do with natural selection).",hey tom thanks answering even want suggest evolution good explanation feature pretty bad explanation feature want suggest evolution good explanation phenomenon asked say response - philosophical level guy quoted use energy trying explain feature function etc based evolution wish know prove philosophical ground appealing wrong follows try give background word know natural selection blind assuming case nothing say lot randomness environment natural selection operates advocating blind quoting ed - get right anyway - answer ben shapiro video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfvywpyfbiq see specific question ben formulating response following minute would suggest watch whole video back response - get correctly - arguing natural selection blindness saying natural selection could explain human mind directed truth really important note talking truth directness feature present case agree like said natural selection explains fitness passing gene important note fact presupposing true formulated argument - may agree - trueness nothing point making said natural selection explains fitness etc related mind directedness truth per see made background avoid misunderstanding trying ask could make similar answer disentangling body unity evolution natural selection claim problem evolution trying say someone could conflate two problem evolution one side unity substantial form example someone say unity caused evolutionary process co-opted cell someone plausibly may think unity accidental one personally think true - think insane - people believe say insane - would beg question instead would argue philosophically show trying say two problem ie unity think organ function related one indivisible unity natural selection evolution could nothing - might seem least related someone might argue something like example presented asking ed could disentangle two like way explaining truth per se nothing natural selection,feser,3372,0,2056

" _In the American context, how about totally free education (books, tuition, room and board, everything) at every level for historically oppressed minorities, paid for by the super-rich, and continued until such time as the wealth gap between whites and minorities was erased._      Amazing how so many plans to erase a racial divide (which must always be illicit and evil, not at all natural) inevitably turns into a not-so-subtle payday for people.

And it's not going to be the super-rich paying either.      If the concern is to provide education as cheaply and freely as possible, maybe we should consider price caps on tuition. The fact is, with the modern internet, we are capable of providing a massive amount of education for dirt cheap compared to what traditional, outdated institutions currently offer. In fact, we already do so: see Coursera, or all kinds of other online options.      But this solution, while clearly viable and even superior to the traditional alternative, would not enrich the bloated, inefficient education system. And, for all the cries of racism and inequality, circumventing that kind of payout is not a price the loudest antiracists are willing to pay.

"Tom (cont.),   ""As for ""Carrasquillo"", I don't much care what he says.""   Feser provides a link to his work on the right side column of resources on this site, Ite ad Thomam. If you were to study his syllogistic interpretation of the First Way you would likely gain knowledge into the structure of the logical arguments Aquinas employed.      ""I am sorry, but you do not seem to understand what their results say.""   Aside from the defects I have previously demonstrated the First Way is also logically invalid as an argument for the necessity of the first mover in that it employs the logical fallacy of false dichotomy, namely that a thing must either move itself or inactively be moved by another. Aquinas crucially failed to account for the case where two objects, each incapable of moving themselves, have the ability to actively move each other. This mutual repulsion or mutual attraction is in fact how motion occurs at the most fundamental level. Macro examples abound, such as a rocket, which moves itself through space using the principle popularized as ""for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction"".      Thus, a gross error of Aquinas, one he certainly had access to in his time and glaringly failed to realize, is in this statement ""It is therefore impossible that in the same respect and in the same way a thing should be both mover and moved, i.e. that it should move itself.""      You move yourself even when you hold your breath. An underwater mammal is a clear example of an object that moves itself. Aquinas failed to realize this obvious fact.      Other examples of objects that move themselves abound, such as the aforementioned rocket, also a submarine boat, timed reactive device, battery operated clock, self drive electric vehicle, the sun and every other star, and on and on, making this error of Aquinas rather egregious.      At the base of these cases of objects that are in fact both mover and moved, that do in fact move themselves, is the mechanism of mutual motion of objects that otherwise cannot move themselves, say, two electrons, or an electron and a proton, each of which cannot move itself if alone in space, but can mutually move each other via the electrostatic force.

"@Tanner   Your second DBH quote is bunk. Turn to the first option he attacks, and ask what it means for a potential to be “beyond” the divine nature. I think his second prong suggests he is using “beyond” to mean “distinct from”. For, to reach his conclusion, this internal, unrealized potency must mean something that truly is part of God, thus undermining several essential attributes.   If I’m interpreting him correctly, I can’t help but wonder, what’s the problem? It shouldn’t be that God is realizing what could be called an objective potency. I see three possibilities for how that might threaten God’s claims to divinity:   1\. It undermines his aseity   2\. It threatens his immutability   3\. It does away with his simplicity   But it’s far from clear that realizing an objective potency does any of those things. There’s no reason to suppose that making a choice involves any kind of change on the choosing agent’s part, for example.   And we can already see why divine aseity goes on unscathed. An “objective potency”, as I’ve dubbed it here, takes it for granted that the possible thing doesn’t actually exist. It’s merely a possibility, for something that isn’t self-existing. Or are we supposed to think that because God is the ultimate ground for modality, that every objective potency is just one of God’s passive potencies? Is there any reason to believe that? I won’t take it just because you want me to.",tanner second dbh quote bunk turn first option attack ask mean potential “ beyond ” divine nature think second prong suggests using “ beyond ” mean “ distinct from ” reach conclusion internal unrealized potency must mean something truly part god thus undermining several essential attribute interpreting correctly help wonder problem god realizing could called objective potency see three possibility might threaten claim divinity \ undermines aseity \ threatens immutability \ away simplicity far clear realizing objective potency thing reason suppose making choice involves kind change choosing part example already see divine aseity go unscathed “ objective potency ” dubbed take granted possible thing actually exist merely possibility something self-existing supposed think god ultimate ground modality every objective potency one passive potency reason believe take want,feser,1424,0,2076

"A pope is said to speak _ex cathedra_ or “from the chair” when he solemnly puts forward some teaching in a manner intended to be definitive and absolutely binding. This is also known as an exercise of the pope’s _extraordinary magisterium_ , and its point is to settle once and for all disputed matters concerning faith or morals. The First Vatican Council taught that such _ex cathedra_ doctrinal definitions are infallible and thus irreformable.

"""For God, there is no real past, present, or future, to God all is Now. God can directly experience every part of that Big Now. Difficuly one is if there is no real past, there can be no before, now, afterwards.""      The first sentence is not how a classical Theist would make the sort of assertion you are trying to make. If you are going to engage in dialogue where anyone at all takes you seriously, you are going to have to make more effort understanding the positions you appear hell bent on rejecting. Perhaps if you at least understand them correctly, that spark within you that cares about understanding rather than pretending might be fanned into a flame.      To say is correctly, you would say that God is not bound by time. That is a correct way to state the initial premise in an argument that you are set on criticizing. Now this requires an understanding of time and time's relation to matter, if you are going to actually understand a classical theist on this point.      In your third sentence quoted above you move from talking about God being outside time to simply making the assertion that this entails that there is not past, present, or future. Here you move from the assertion that since God is outside time, everyone and everything must be outside time. Well once it is framed that way (and this is an accurate way to frame the issue based on St. Augustine and St. Thomas' understanding of the relationship between time and matter--again more below--and God's relationship to time and matter), it becomes clear that what you are saying is sheer nonsense. So if you are going to frame a critique of classical theism, you are going to have to offer something beyond a sophmoric and blundering misinterpretation and misrepresentation of the premises of the classical theists argument.      Regarding the relationship between time and matter, Philo and St. Augustine held that these are interdependent and this is confirmed by modern physics (See Barr's Modern Physics and Ancient Faith). We are subject to the limits associated with time because we are corporeal beings and there is interrelationship between time and matter. After all, we measure time with respect to the movement of matter (e.g. the rotation of the earth around the sun). So the argument requires a deeper understanding and exposition of their understanding of time in order to get their argument right in the first place.      You have not taken the time to understand all of this which is why there is no one here that is impressed with what you have to say on this matter. If you wish to have your arguments taken seriously, why don't you first make a serious effort to consider the arguments of figures like St. Augustine and St. Thomas? This of course requires that you actually make a good faith effort to understand them on their terms. Now this would also require a smidge of humility in recognizing that they have something to teach you and that it is, to put it gently, relatively unlikely that you have created a fool proof argument against God's existence that no one else has ever considered. Humility and a firm grasp on reality always walk together hand in hand.",god real past present future god god directly experience every part big difficuly one real past afterwards first sentence classical theist would make sort assertion trying make going engage dialogue anyone take seriously going make effort understanding position appear hell bent rejecting perhaps least understand correctly spark within care understanding rather pretending might fanned flame say correctly would say god bound time correct way state initial premise argument set criticizing requires understanding time relation matter going actually understand classical theist point third sentence quoted move talking god outside time simply making assertion entail past present future move assertion since god outside time everyone everything must outside time well framed way accurate way frame issue based st augustine st understanding relationship time matter -- again below -- and relationship time matter becomes clear saying sheer nonsense going frame critique classical theism going offer something beyond sophmoric blundering misinterpretation misrepresentation premise classical theist argument regarding relationship time matter philo st augustine held interdependent confirmed modern physic see modern physic ancient faith subject limit associated time corporeal being interrelationship time matter measure time respect movement matter eg rotation earth around sun argument requires deeper understanding exposition understanding time order get argument right first place taken time understand one impressed say matter wish argument taken seriously first make serious effort consider argument figure like st augustine st thomas course requires actually make good faith effort understand term would also require smidge humility recognizing something teach put gently relatively unlikely created fool proof argument existence one else ever considered humility firm grasp reality always walk together hand hand,feser,3169,0,2080

"I'd like to discuss the Scholastic distinction between potency and act. It is often alleged that without this distinction, it is impossible to make sense of change. I'm not so sure about that.      Surely we can account for change simply by positing different levels of actuality. Thus an actual piece of gold (a substance) may acquire the higher- level (accidental) actualizations of roundness and flatness, when hammered by a goldsmith. There's no need for talk of mysterious potencies here - just different levels of actuality.      Consider also the fact that every potency, whether passive or active, is grounded in some actuality. A boxer, for instance, has the passive power to be bruised because his body is actually covered with flesh, and he has the active power to hit and knock out his opponent because his body actually contains bone and muscle, enabling him to punch hard.      Readers might ask, ""What's the difference between the account you're proposing and the Aristotelian account? And couldn't simply we define 'potency' as a lower level of actuality?"" The practical difference between the two accounts is that if every potency is grounded in some actuality, then the existence of prime matter, or pure passive potency, becomes a metaphysical impossibility. It's actuality all the way down, until we finally get to some ultimate physical forms (quantum fields, perhaps?) underlying the everyday objects we see.

"Finally, experimentation too, Cartwright argues, is a much more complex affair than is implied by the common notion that “science = theory + experiment.” Experiment is often treated as if its only point is to test theory. But that is not the case. Sometimes experimentation is carried out even in the absence of any well-worked out theory, in an _exploratory_ way that aims simply to see what will happen under various circumstances. Sometimes experimentation _creates_ new phenomena that would otherwise not be observed – where, precisely because they have not otherwise been observed, no theory yet exists to account for them. Sometimes experimentation _reconstitutes_ phenomena in the sense of deeply altering our understanding of them, even in the absence of theoretical considerations. And in all these cases, experimentation, like theory, depends on fixing the content of concepts, on models, and so on.",finally experimentation cartwright argues much complex affair implied common notion “ science theory experiment ” experiment often treated point test theory case sometimes experimentation carried even absence well-worked theory exploratory way aim simply see happen various circumstance sometimes experimentation creates new phenomenon would otherwise observed – precisely otherwise observed theory yet exists account sometimes experimentation reconstitutes phenomenon sense deeply altering understanding even absence theoretical consideration case experimentation like theory depends fixing content concept model,feser,909,0,2085

"There are many horrendous evils that a loving father God should prevent/stop, and should be able to. For example, many cases of horrendous suffering caused by some diseases; sexual abuse and torture; etc. The list could go on and on. And Christians do believe that God does, in fact, sometimes prevent or stop said evils through (for example) miracles or providence. So it is a problem why there are still so many of these evils going on and our loving Father does nothing about it - not even when people desperately or earnestly pray and beg him for help.      ""And how could God prevent the evils in the world without also preventing the wonderful goods that accidentally give rise to them or to which by Divine mercy they lead?""      I do not know with certainty that God could do that. But it does seem like there are many cases of seemingly gratuitous, horrible evil - which God should therefore prevent or stop. And again, Christians do believe that God does that in some cases, too (either through miracle or providence). So the problem seems pressing to me.      I believe in God, so in the end I do think that there is some greater good that is achieved with God not-intervening, or allowing this universe to just be full of suffering and horror for some time, etc. I hope there is a morally sufficient reason for it all and that the Form of the Good (God) is not so distant from our love, hopes and needs. But this is a serious epistemic cost - because when I look at the world, it does seem like there are purely gratuitous horrendous evils, or that God should be doing better, and so on. It's a bad epistemic cost, one that I wish I could avoid, and it makes me think that some people truly are reasonable in their position of atheism. I personally just happen to find theism to be harder to deny, rationally speaking, so I think it offsets the problem of evil in the end.

"Dear @Rafa      It's been three years since I first met Ed's work and blog (in October of 2023, it will be 4!). I found his work (by chance) in the first place, but I must say that I am very, very grateful for this man's work. And it's not an overstatement to say that he saved and changed my life. I admire him so much - and I can affirm to you without hesitation that you will find his work very helpful throughout your life and philosophical inquiries.      Before going into recommending books and authors I must warn you to not get philosophical ideas over your head. Do not overthink them too much. That's friendly advice. I have OCD and I must say that's a nightmare. Just to give you a comparison, back when I was 15 to 16 years old and I learned more about nazism, and socialism (e.g the great purge, the massacres against the Jews; started reading about Solzhenitsyn and Alexander Bezmenov, for example) I thought that nothing could be worse than all of that but - for my unfortunate surprise - there are philosophical ideas that can be very harmful too (for example, eliminativism, reductionism, anti-realism about persons) and they are simply difficult, at least for me, to get it out of my head - not because they are soo much convincing but because they are bizarre with even bizarre consequences and if you got to them off-guard and have OCD or the like, you will suffer with this. So, please, be very careful about it (even if you do not have any kind of psychological disease).      There are a lot of things that I learned through all these years but you must note that I am NOT, in any important sense, an authority or expert in the matter (and my OCD blurs a lot of what I learned). First, to understand all of this right, I really think that Ed's work will be the best grounding for all of it. I do recommend you to read his book Aquinas (which I forgot to mention, but it's simply a very good book for beginners too!). You should also read his post's regarding Aristotelian-Thomistic Metaphysics to grasp everything better.      But there are, of course, works and philosophers that I do recommend you read - starting with the *easiest ones*: Mortimer J. Adler (Aristotle's for everyone, for example, and the collab book Thomistic Psychology ); William Norris Clarke (The one and the many); Richard Percival Philips (Modern Thomistic manual); Reginald Garigou-Lagrange (Reality: a synthesis); Desiré- Joseph Mercier (Manual of modern scholastic philosophy vol.1); Steve J. Jensen (The human person. A beginner's Thomistic psychology); and last - but not least - the amazing book written by Tomás Alvira, Luís Clavell, and Tomás Mellendo Granado (Metaphysics, but I do recommend you to read the English version of it for the very same reasons you should read the TLS in English).      The ones listed above are the *easiest* - or at least the most noob-friendly IMHO (that may be controversial and I am aware of that). There are, of course, other books that treat the matters more deeply but they are way, way harder to understand and I urge you to not dive into them - at least for now. Some examples are David Oderberg's (Real Essentialism) and Edward Jonathan Lowe (the possibility of metaphysics, for example). If you ever try to dive into them, I do recommend, of course, starting with Ed's work (especially Scholastic's Meta and Aristotle's Revenge - even though it's a book with difficult matters Ed makes a lot of it intelligible for laypeople) and Michael J. Loux (Metaphysics: a contemporary introduction) because they are very good books for beginners.

"Moreover, as I have argued, if you do accept these background views, then to be consistent you’d have to draw other conclusions that most New Atheist types would not want to draw. Again, if you accept a Humean critique of natural theology, then to be consistent you should also be skeptical about the claims of natural science and ethics to tell us anything about objective reality. And if you accept a Kantian critique of natural theology, then while you can consistently take natural science and ethics to have a rational basis, you cannot consistently treat theology with the contempt that Dawkins and Co. typically do.

"""I think it would be closer to say that you completely misunderstand, since almost all of what you say is tangential, not contradictory, to what I said""      Well, it seemed to me that you had reduced relevant moral norms to customs and a ""framework of human practices and institutions"", and I strongly disagree with that. That human suffering is (ceteris paribus, to avoid soul-building considerations) something lamentable is a necessary truth, for example.      ""But you are evidently fatally deceived as to the meaning of that term, since you believe (apparently?!) that creatures ""come to possess"" these same eminent perfections when they are perfected""      They do not come to possess the same exact thing univocally (which in God would only be one perfection), but whatever they actuality come to possess must be pre-contained within God in at least the same degree or in a greater way. As such, every actuality in our ""moral agency"" must be present in God, and *not* in an inferior way. Every actuality, not every limitation. If God possessed our perfection of Intellect in a way that made him unable to know things, that would be absurd. It would be inferior. If God possessed our perfection of moral agency in such a way that he could not know moral truths (""rape is wrong"", ""human suffering is ceteris paribus bad and to be avoided"", etc) and could not act in accordance with moral truths or practical judgment, then it would be an inferior actuality. Which would be absurd.      So you are turning the discussion into something else - I never said anything that was incompatible with analogy, for instance; I was even quite explicit in saying that God's formal possession of our perfections (again, see Garrigou- Lagrange for example) does not deny analogy. And you are missing the point that if moral agency is a pure perfection (like wisdom is), then it is also proper to say God is a moral agent. Except if you wanna reject that God is wise, perhaps.      But if God did not know you existed or that you and I were having this conversation, this would certainly be a problem and he would not be ""God"" in the way that believers take him to be. And not in the sense that believers might have mistaken views of God (thinking he has real parts for instance, or is changing or whatever), but in a sense that would make most of them conclude that God would (absurdly) be seriously defective, and not worthy of worship at all.      It's not that hard, actually. If God is indifferent to (e.g.) a child being tortured to the point where he could simply not bother to do anything to stop or prevent it, when it is in his power to do so, then God would be seriously defective, unimpressive and unworthy of love and worship.      In which case he would not be God, as God is supposed to be.      But then God cannot be indifferent to that kind of stuff, i.e. prima facie, if God exists, he should be stopping or preventing these evils, unless he has morally sufficient reasons for not doing so (and then we're back to standard theodicy, skeptical theism, etc. Which us theists cannot avoid.)",think would closer say completely misunderstand since almost say tangential contradictory said well seemed reduced relevant moral norm custom framework human practice institution strongly disagree human suffering ceteris paribus avoid soul-building consideration something lamentable necessary truth example evidently fatally deceived meaning term since believe apparently creature come posse eminent perfection perfected come posse exact thing univocally god would one perfection whatever actuality come posse must pre-contained within god least degree greater way every actuality moral agency must present god inferior way every actuality every limitation god possessed perfection intellect way made unable know thing would absurd would inferior god possessed perfection moral agency way could know moral truth rape wrong human suffering ceteris paribus bad avoided etc could act accordance moral truth practical judgment would inferior actuality would absurd turning discussion something else - never said anything incompatible analogy instance even quite explicit saying formal possession perfection see garrigou- lagrange example deny analogy missing point moral agency pure perfection like wisdom also proper say god moral agent except wan na reject god wise perhaps god know existed conversation would certainly problem would god way believer take sense believer might mistaken view god thinking real part instance changing whatever sense would make conclude god would absurdly seriously defective worthy worship hard actually god indifferent eg child tortured point could simply bother anything stop prevent power god would seriously defective unimpressive unworthy love worship case would god god supposed god can not indifferent kind stuff ie prima facie god exists stopping preventing evil unless morally sufficient reason back standard theodicy skeptical theism etc u theist can not avoid,feser,3096,0,2099

"Hey @Rafa,      I'm Brazilian too so I think I can help you with this. First, I must say that Aristotelian-Thomistic metaphysics (A-T for short now on) is well-developed and could be hard to understand at first (and indeed, it could take a long time to get a lot of it right) but Ed's turn makes all of that intelligible and very readable for lay people like us. Second, if you grow up like me (I'm from around Sampa, btw) and had that *amazing* educational system regarding philosophy and related matters, I friendly suggest that you get rid of all of these crap notions that you could have learned about the soul, religion and etc. because this will effectively hinder your knowledge - and you will be reading into A-T metaphysics something that's not true of it!      For a start, I do recommend the famous The Last Superstition (TLS, for short), but I urge you to not buy the Portuguese version (even though the cover art is awesome), but instead, you should buy the yellow cape OG version. I know it may sound paradoxical, but you will understand the English version much better than the Portuguese one because our Portuguese version looks like the people who translated it have a superficial understanding of the doctrine and even less knew Ed's amazing style of writing a book (i.e the Portuguese version is a pedantic, hard to read and misleading just like the great majority of continental philosophy books that we are familiar with). I don't know if you share that opinion about our philosophical school (continental) but I can say without thinking twice that I only could grasp things truly when I read the original version. So keep that in mind.      I do recommend though that you read the book calmly, and carefully and not read your own understanding into the book itself. And when you get a better familiarity with A-T (through the monumental, careful, and well-detailed blog posts that Ed wrote throughout all these years and the TLS itself) I do recommend, with some cautions, Scholastic Metaphysics: A contemporary introduction. The caution part is because, even though Ed's incomparable ability to make it readable through and through you gonna face some things - to say the truth a lot of it - that we are unfamiliar with because of our traditional philosophical school (e.g causal powers, dispositions, modality, essence and existence, identity over time in some sense, and others).      If you want to know more about Our Father, I do recommend you to read the wonderful Five Proofs for the existence of God. In this book, Ed goes through five philosophical arguments given for the existence of God. In special, it would be nice if you already have some familiarity with the Act/Potency distinction - even though Ed goes through to explain it in the book - because if you grasp that distinction, you will see why the Aristotelian Proof further developed by Saint Thomas must necessarily follow from the philosophical premises of the argument. You don't need faith to know that God does exist, but after knowing that His existence sure follows and that for some reason does not change your faith... I dare to say that you don't understand the argument right.      And, of course, there are A LOT of good-willed fellows out here in the blog (e.g Michael Copas, grodriges, Mister Geocon, UncommonDescent, and my homeboy Talmid just to say a few ones that I remember).

Suppose that Alice and Bob are not fully utilitarian, but they incorporate into their ethics (which they follow perfectly) an anti-conventionalist element (and that's also a part of their shared knowledge). Thus, they think that the fact that one has promised p is a fairly weak reason, of degree epsilon, against performing p. Then, if epsilon>0, then it seems that by their lights Alice and Bob should lift their left hands rather than their right, if they promised to lift their right, since their behavioral bias is anti-promissory, and each knows the other to have such a bias. Very well. Now take the limit as epsilon (the strength of the reason they think favors breaking promises) to zero. For every epsilon>0, they should lift their left hands rather than their right. It seems to be a reasonable continuity conclusion that for epsilon=0, they should either be neutral between lifting their left hands rather than their right or should still prefer the left, but definitely should not prefer their right.

How in this world could this be just for God to allow this?

Sometimes the suffering of one person can be for the good of another person. This occurs in war and in the case of anyone who makes a sacrifice for someone else. The difference between the suffering of an adult in war is that such suffering is generally voluntary and the suffering of an innocent child is not. Yet this only poses a problem if we hold the premise that the child must understand the reason for his suffering for the suffering to have a reason.

It's not hard to find these guys arguing that there are ""stone- wise arranged atoms"" or that natural selection somehow vindicates the idea of impermanence (Garfield appeals a lot more for these kinds of things, that's why I'm not using his work that much). But that does not seem right, because that turns your metaphysics hostage to the scientific findings - the same findings that may overthrow your own view.      But if we come to focus on other points like their appeal to nominalism, they suffer from the same problems that Ed emphasized in TLS and Scholastics meta. The points like how they can even communicate with themselves if there are no universals - or even worse if there are just ""momentary beings"". But I think that their denial of universals has some relation with their momentariness thesis. And that's what I can't even understand in the first place. How can someone think that something analogous to the Heraclitean position is right in the first place? It's illogical. And someone might even say that, correctly, that the ""buddhist logic"" is very different from ""Aristotelian logic"". Fair enough. But that doesn't explain why someone might think that something so absurd as ""impermanent beings"" (let alone mereological nihilism, nominalism) is plausible in the first place. To affirm that ""there are no pots that last longer than a moment"" and that ""there is just a series of ephemeral pots one after another"" is not to disprove permanence, but to evade the problem altogether.

"@papalinton      As far as I have read what is banned in schools is only the teaching of nonsensical notions of whiteness or micro aggressions, it does not ban the teaching of facts that there are racists or white supremacists. But it does bar making white students apologise to black students for transgressions of the past or teaching that the white people of today have innate racism of which they don't know about. This is literally what is being taught in schools, muti national corporations etc. And it's not just white people, any group that has a had any measure of success in the system namely Asians, has been accused of pandering to the so called White Supremacists. If people are banning CRT at the college level is wrong but at the school level, there is really no need to teach children that America's social and economic structures are supposedly inherently designed to prevent the success of minorities. There may be particular people in the system who are acting in a racist way, that's not s failure of the system, rather it's a failure of the people to abide by the system. People are flawed and every once in a while you can encounter a racist jerk but it's inevitable, there's a limit to which you can fine tune recruitment so as to get the ideal employee. And if a liberal like Bill Maher has a problem with what happens in schools regarding white students being told that they owe something to black students then you know that there is a problem.

"Asock   ""What I should have said was,""did you *finish* the article?""""   Fair enough, I mean, just because one reads a part of the article does not mean one finished it, but yes, I finished it.      If Feser holds that at base matter is without form and is indeterminate then that would violate the PSR, since an indeterminate process requires an effect without a reason. That is what intrinsic randomness would be, events happening for no reason, much less a sufficient reason.      So, how does purpose emerge from purposelessness? Divine intervention? Aquinas argues for just that in his Fifth Way ""Now whatever lacks intelligence cannot move towards an end, unless it be directed by some being endowed with knowledge and intelligence; as the arrow is shot to its mark by the archer. Therefore some intelligent being exists by whom all natural things are directed to their end; and this being we call God.""      There is nothing in modern physics that references a divine being to infuse purposeless fundamental material with purpose at some intermediate level, hence, modern physics does not align with Aristotelian physics in this regard.      Now, if you wish, you can cherry pick a few areas of agreement, for example, in modern physics material moves, and Aristotle observed that material moves, so there you go.      Here is one source for the physics of Aristotle. Aside from such trivial and superficial associations there is virtually no prediction of modern physics by Aristotle, and Aristotle got the core of physics wrong, which is why the argument for the first mover is unsound.   archive.org/stream/aristotle-physics-book-III-and-IV-clarendon/aristotle- physics-book-III-and-IV-clarendon_djvu.txt   IV. 8 TRANSLATION 214 b   (4)   214 b PHYSICS IV.8   (4) ( a 19—22)",asock said wasdid finish article fair enough mean one read part article mean one finished yes finished feser hold base matter without form indeterminate would violate psr since indeterminate process requires effect without reason intrinsic randomness would event happening reason much le sufficient reason purpose emerge purposelessness divine intervention aquinas argues fifth way whatever lack intelligence can not move towards end unless directed endowed knowledge intelligence arrow shot mark archer therefore intelligent exists natural thing directed end call god nothing modern physic reference divine infuse purposeless fundamental material purpose intermediate level hence modern physic align aristotelian physic regard wish cherry pick area agreement example modern physic material move aristotle observed material move go one source physic aristotle aside trivial superficial association virtually prediction modern physic aristotle aristotle got core physic wrong argument first mover unsound archiveorgstreamaristotle-physics-book-iii-and-iv-clarendonaristotle- physics-book-iii-and-iv-clarendondjvutxt iv translation b b physic iv —,feser,1783,0,2141

" _but I think it's prudent to pursue this end only in a way that invokes a generic sort of theism on a governmental level._      And you think this...why?      I respect that your feelings and intuitions are not necessarily easy to ground in readily stated principles, and this doesn't make them _wrong_. But others have equally strong feelings and intuitions in other directions, so it is necessary to at least attempt to get at principles that should (or could) be held in common.      _I think the only plausible or effective way for a state to affirm theism is only if at the grass roots level a religious upbringing is pursued such that the majority of the people are religious and traditional which in turn forces the politicians to pay due regard to that reality._      Most liberals expressly deny that a wide grass-roots Christianity is a valid basis for the state to ""pay due regard to that reality"" and make laws even _slightly_ favorable to Christianity. (I don't deny it.) You will end up having to enunciate some principle that they might agree with that would justify your conclusion, to get them to even listen - even if your slight favoring doesn't amount to outright persecution of non-Christians.      _I also am skeptical of any claims to the effect of constraining speech on the account of its violating the truth._      I was not suggesting constraining speech on account of its violating truth; rather, the _potential_ for legal constraints when speech violates the VIRTUES associated with truth. For example, yelling ""fire"" in a crowded theater (when there is no fire), can get you locked up in prison: but it's not because the assertion ""fire"" was wrong, it's because the yelling will cause injuries and damage, without due cause. Fraud can land you in prison. So can telling secrets that are TRUE but are not yours to divulge, (e.g. national security secrets, or commercial secrets you signed a contract to keep secret). Likewise, ""fighting words"" are potentially actionable, whether true or not.      The examples I gave regarded people (formerly-Catholic heretics) **taking advantage** of simple or uneducated folks in making claims like ""the Catholic Church teaches X"" when it isn't true. It's not, solely, that the assertion wasn't true, it was also that they were using the assertion in an unjust manner to hoodwink people who were unable to backcheck the claims in an easily available source, that made such actions unjust in a way that could be (sometimes, in certain cases) potentially actionable for civil authorities. This made them _unjust_ acts, not merely erroneous claims.      _It can obviously critique any other world view in its governmental promotion of its own view but only critique not prevent._      I think you will find, if you examine this carefully, that a government spending one single dime to ""promote"" the preferred religious view, will be taken (by those of other religions) as _taxing them to pay for a ""false religion"",_ , and almost as odious to them as outright persecution of them on account of their beliefs. Taxation _for X_ is accounted oppression by those who are opposed to X on religious grounds. At the minimum, those taxes cause them to be _less able_ to pursue the public promotion of their own views.      There is NO SUCH THING as a truly neutral government, the idea of it being a secular liberal fiction, and secular states has been trying to force Christians and other religions to support the religion of secular humanism. (It is effectively a religion because it holds a totalizing view of the human being and his happiness (it is not possible to be agnostic about its ultimate claims regarding humans), and its tenets are not susceptible of scientific proof or disproof, i.e. they are held by faith).

"Quoting Hart:    _For God, deliberative liberty – any “could have been otherwise,” any arbitrary decision among opposed possibilities – would be an impossible defect of his freedom._   And:    _A God who merely chooses to create – as one equally possible exercise of deliberative will among others – is either actualizing a potential beyond his nature... or he is actualizing some otherwise unrealized potential within himself...._      I notice that Hart is essentially stating the Modal Collapse objection in these passages, which purports to find a dilemma according to which either creation must be as actual as God Himself, or His act of creation must be utterly arbitrary, random, and unintended on His part.      Rather than rejecting this dilemma as classical theists do, or taking it as an argument against the Unmoved Mover as atheistic proponents of the argument do, Hart affirms the first leg of the dilemma, collapsing creation into necessity and thus crossing into pantheism. He wants to arbitrarily take this only halfway, though, rather than following that line of logic to its full implication that change and multiplicity are illusions, and only Being Itself exists, a la Parmenides.      As Ed points out, to assume that creation must be as necessary as God in order to be caused by God ignores the distinction between active potency and passive potency. And that distinction isn't some special pleading, but rather a direct implication of the Unmoved Mover argument.      I would argue that the idea that creation must be either necessary or random also evinces a tendency especially common among moderns to try to collapse free will (the choices of rational agents with will and intellect) into either blind law-like automation or random chance, the two broad categories of mindless, mechanistic causation allowed by the ""scientific"" reductionist- mechanistic worldview. _Even though we experience it all the time in our own choices_ , they simply have a difficult time understanding that a free rational agent can cause things such that they are not necessitated by the agent's nature but are still grounded in it and non-random, and that this does not reduce to something less.",quoting hart god deliberative liberty – “ could otherwise ” arbitrary decision among opposed possibility – would impossible defect freedom god merely chooses create – one equally possible exercise deliberative among others – either actualizing potential beyond nature actualizing otherwise unrealized potential within notice hart essentially stating modal collapse objection passage purport find dilemma according either creation must actual god act creation must utterly arbitrary random unintended part rather rejecting dilemma classical theist taking argument unmoved mover atheistic proponent argument hart affirms first leg dilemma collapsing creation necessity thus crossing pantheism want arbitrarily take halfway though rather following line logic full implication change multiplicity illusion exists la parmenides ed point assume creation must necessary god order caused god ignores distinction active potency passive potency distinction special pleading rather direct implication unmoved mover argument would argue idea creation must either necessary random also evinces tendency especially common among modern try collapse free choice rational agent intellect either blind law-like automation random chance two broad category mindless mechanistic causation allowed scientific reductionist- mechanistic worldview even though experience time choice simply difficult time understanding free rational agent cause thing necessitated nature still grounded non-random reduce something le,feser,2200,0,2155

"Also, naturalist's theory of ""spandrels"" is, again, a re-enactment of the **actualization of hidden potentialities existing in prime matter.** (an A-Thomistic metaphysical thesis).      Look at this passage from Coyne (Kastrup's ""dim-witted biologist"" :)       **""I have no idea whether consciousness is a direct product of natural selection or a byproduct of selection on features like our brain"".**   https://www.bernardokastrup.com/2020/02/dim-witted-biologist-consciousness- is.html?m=1      What Coyne is hinting at is that some biological features get actualized (become ""real"" when subjected to certain ""selective pressures"" - another name for efficient causes, or the ""inherent powers in the environment""), while others remain **hidden as potentialities/ ""byproducts"").** Once those potentialities are exposed to a different set of environmental conditions (""actualizers"") they come to the surface and become ""real"" (phenotype).

"In order to help clarify this discussion about quantum mechanics, I would like to stress the fact that in physics, when we consider an equation of motion, we explicitly describe the value of a measurement, M, if it were to occur at a specific space and time measurement (x,t). Mathematically, this is represented as M(x,t). However, it's important to note that a priori, M(x,t) is not a property of the measured system, but rather a property of the measuring tool. If the system is out of the spatial and temporal range of the measuring tool, there would be no result at all.   In Newtonian physics, it is postulated that M(x,t) is a property of the measured system, independently of the measuring tool. However, this goes against our common sense, Aristotelian physics, and quantum physics.   In reality, M(x,t) encompasses the notions of actuality, potentiality, and contextuality. Interpreting it as a simple description of the actuality of the system to be measured is a simplification of its true meaning and can only be justified for relatively gross engineering purposes. A physical system's form, its ""whatness,"" includes its actuality (i.e. what can be measured in the here and now of the instrument of measure), its potentiality (which, by definition, is not measurable by any instrument as it is not in any (x,t), but needs a motion that would cause it to become actual and then measurable), and its contextuality (which is the relationship of the said system with the whole measurement environment). M(x,t) expresses all of this.   A quantum wave of probability P(x,t) is not the property of the considered physical system, but rather a description of the probability of getting a specific result by a contextual measurement instrument operating in principle in its (x,t).   As a result, the famous wave packet reduction, is simply the result of the physical system interacting with the measurement instrument in its (x,t) and does not require any consciousness to happen.",order help clarify discussion quantum mechanic would like stress fact physic consider equation motion explicitly describe value measurement occur specific space time measurement xt mathematically represented mxt however important note priori mxt property measured system rather property measuring tool system spatial temporal range measuring tool would result newtonian physic postulated mxt property measured system independently measuring tool however go common sense aristotelian physic quantum physic reality mxt encompasses notion actuality potentiality contextuality interpreting simple description actuality system measured simplification true meaning justified relatively gross engineering purpose physical form whatness includes actuality ie measured instrument measure potentiality definition measurable instrument xt need motion would cause become actual measurable contextuality relationship said system whole measurement environment mxt express quantum wave probability pxt property considered physical system rather description probability getting specific result contextual measurement instrument operating principle xt result famous wave packet reduction simply result physical system interacting measurement instrument xt require consciousness happen,feser,1984,0,2169

"(continued from previous 2 posts)      With this in mind, take the question now to the issue of future Popes making judgments about the views of previous popes. As Vatican I notes, we might ask if a future Pope could override the judgment of a previous Pope as to whether that previous view was indeed heretical or not. Indeed, this might even hold to the previous Pope's own views. BUT, it is still hard to see how one could judge that the previous pope was FORMALLY heretical, since he presumably would not have taken his own view to be heretical. Could a future pope judge that a previous pope really did know his view to be heretical, etc.?      This raises some very thorny issues indeed. It seems to me that this could not occur because as I understand it, part of the process of declaring someone a formal heretic is that the person is confronted by the authority with a judgment of heresy, and obstinately persists in his views. Obviously, this cannot happen for someone who is deceased.      Another difficulty of course is that if we say future popes can override the judgment of prior popes, then we would also have to hold that an even later pope could override THAT judgment, and so on. BUT, given that we hold that Popes are bound by magisterial teaching, one might ask how this could happen. Or, are popes bound only by magisterial teaching, and not by all previous magisterial juridical decisions, etc.? If we hold that juridical judgments are not infallible (even if they are authoritative in their time), then it seems one could, in theory, later remove the anathemas of Honorius, or whatever. (It certainly seems in other cases a future pope could override earlier papal juridical decisions--e.g., we can conceive of a person excommunicated being reinstated in the church by a future pope, and so on--does this change when the decisions are concretized in conciliar declarations, etc.?

"@bmiller: your questions call for what could be a long discussion, maybe potentially too long for a thread this old. And I am not the most learned discussion partner you'll find among skeptics.

If someone wants to deny axioms like the principle of identity or the PNC, I don't see how I can have a rational discussion with that person, since from A = ~A anything follows.

"   In the wake of the deaths of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and Cardinal George Pell, it has emerged that each of them raised serious criticisms of aspects of Pope Francis’s teaching and governance of the Church. How might the pope respond to these criticisms? [As I have explained elsewhere](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2018/05/the-church-permits- criticism-of-popes_20.html), the Church explicitly teaches that even popes can under certain circumstances respectfully be criticized by the faithful. Moreover, Pope Francis himself has explicitly said on several occasions that he welcomes criticism. It seems clear that the criticisms raised by Benedict and Pell are precisely the kind that the pope should take the most seriously, given the teaching of the Church and his own views about the value of criticism.",wake death pope emeritus benedict xvi cardinal george pell emerged raised serious criticism aspect pope teaching governance church might pope respond criticism explained elsewherehttpsedwardfeserblogspotcomthe-church-permits- criticism-of-popeshtml church explicitly teach even pope certain circumstance respectfully criticized faithful moreover pope francis explicitly said several occasion welcome criticism seems clear criticism raised benedict pell precisely kind pope take seriously given teaching church view value criticism,feser,816,0,2188

It seems to me that under such a hermeneutic, it is basically impossible to convey outside of a straight philosophical treatise anything resembling a minority philosophical opinion.

"The logic that underpins quantum physics is consistent with Aristotle's principles, specifically, the principle of non-contradiction as well as the principle of the excluded middle.   In physics, the application of the first principle is always satisfied as it states that, when a system evolves from one state to another, it gains new properties which were just potential, while it loses others simultaneously (this is what motion is all about, not the poetic license of a “flow” of time and space but, much simply, just a change of state of the considered physical system).   The application of the second Aristotelian principle in physics asserts that for every physical property, there is an opposing property.   The use of orthonormal Hilbert spaces in quantum physics mathematically represents these Aristotelian physical properties.   An article by D. Aerts in 1993 effectively illustrates these framework structures, and even provides an example of a macroscopic quantum structure that is based on non-Boolean logic and isomorphic to the logical framework of spin 1/2 physics.   Notably, it was D. Aerts himself who in 1981, in his doctoral dissertation ""The One and the Many,"" rigorously demonstrated the formal contradiction between stating (a) a system is divided into two subsystems and (b) the properties of that system correspond perfectly with pure quantum states (for the specialists in quantum logic, this is because the logical relationship called weak modularity, which is always valid in a Hilbert space, is not valid in a system composed of two separated subsystems).   This elegantly resolves the intrinsic contradiction in the formulation of the famous cat paradox (or pseudo-paradox E.P.R.).",logic underpins quantum physic consistent principle specifically principle non-contradiction well principle excluded middle physic application first principle always satisfied state system evolves one state another gain new property potential loses others simultaneously motion poetic license “ flow ” time space much simply change state considered physical system application second aristotelian principle physic asserts every physical property opposing property use orthonormal hilbert space quantum physic mathematically represents aristotelian physical property article aerts effectively illustrates framework structure even provides example macroscopic quantum structure based non-boolean logic isomorphic logical framework spin physic notably aerts doctoral dissertation one many rigorously demonstrated formal contradiction stating system divided two subsystem b property system correspond perfectly pure quantum state specialist quantum logic logical relationship called weak modularity always valid hilbert space valid system composed two separated subsystem elegantly resolve intrinsic contradiction formulation famous cat paradox pseudo-paradox epr,feser,1715,0,2192
"Another interesting piece which again forces us to confront, if we are willing and honest, the critical matter of ""the anthropological question"" as it relates to social and interpersonal moral claims.      Progressives wish to avoid the question of the grounding of categorical obligations and duties: pretending that categories which they have abolished can still somehow produce claims structures. Whereas conservatives seem too terrified to face these critical questions at all: ""What happens when we take the anti-teleological pronouncements of the organisms of the political left at face value as a potential predicate for dealing with them? How do we frame the ""moral encounter"" which results when we confront an organism which denies the existence of natural kinds, and therefore of kind-based shared aims and interests? What IS the appetite-manifesting-thing that confronts us in order to emit various sorts of noises which are apparently meant to impel us to adopt certain behaviors it desires? And finally, without a teleological framework, can anyone even speak of confronting a coherent being?      We say the thing is a desiring-thing or that it expresses a will. But so what?

What is it about about ""its"" , or better ""this"" will - assuming that such a will is even subject to rational analysis - is supposed to compel respect or forbearance or even self-sacrificial consideration?

Then in _F_ 2 the following is true: there is a time at which Snaky exists but nothing outside of Snaky’s rattle exists.

" _1) Yes it was an act of the Magisterium, even from the Pope himself, thus 2) Therefore the Magisterium is not protected even from heresy in its ordinary teachings._      What, specifically, makes you phrase the second as ""not protected from _heresy_?""      We know that the Church's fallible teachings (I.e. those which were not taught infallibly) are ""not **absolutely** protected"" from ERROR, in that fallible teachings are reformable and might eventually be reformed because they were wrong and needed to be corrected.      But one cannot conclude from this that the Church's fallible teachings are therefore _utterly_ not protected from error, i.e. that there is simply NOTHING that limits how much error they have. That doesn't follow. As I understand it, the Church says of these teachings that they, too, are influenced by the Holy Spirit, in a lesser way, such that the Church will not fall into such error (on non-infallible teachings) that she _lastingly_ leads Christians into grave error that endangers their souls. These criteria are inherently difficult to apply to particular cases, but the basic _idea_ is that, like situation where the Holy Spirit's action by which He molds the teachings of the many bishops so that they (without formal collusion) all teach the same thing so that it becomes an infallible teaching, so also at other times He molds their teaching so that where one or some are in error, others are not, or at least not gravely and for long. This is indeed a protection, afforded to _the Church_ , that does not protect from every error, rather from an error having a certain scale of effect.      Clearly the Arian heresy running rampant was an error _in the ranks of bishops_ so that they were teaching error, but it never swallowed the entire episcopate. Since it is simply the case that the bishops who were Arians were teaching _wrongly_ by their _officially demanding_ belief in Arianism, and since the bishops certainly exercise their magisterial office when they teach in an official capacity in such wise as to insist on and require assent, we know that ""the Magisterium can teach error"" _in at least that limited sense_ , don't we?",yes act magisterium even pope thus therefore magisterium protected even heresy ordinary teaching specifically make phrase second protected heresy know fallible teaching ie taught infallibly absolutely protected error fallible teaching reformable might eventually reformed wrong needed corrected one can not conclude fallible teaching therefore utterly protected error ie simply nothing limit much error follow understand church say teaching influenced holy spirit lesser way church fall error non-infallible teaching lastingly lead christian grave error endangers soul criterion inherently difficult apply particular case basic idea like situation holy action mold teaching many bishop without formal collusion teach thing becomes infallible teaching also time mold teaching one error others least gravely long indeed protection afforded church protect every error rather error certain scale effect clearly arian heresy running rampant error rank bishop teaching error never swallowed entire episcopate since simply case bishop arians teaching wrongly officially demanding belief arianism since bishop certainly exercise magisterial office teach official capacity wise insist require assent know magisterium teach error least limited sense,feser,2176,0,2202

The title is [“Socialism versus the Family,”](http://www.edwardfeser.com/unpublishedpapers/socialismvsthefamily.html) and I presented it at the Heritage Foundation back in February of 2019. The talk begins by explaining the economics and ethos of socialism, and how socialism is related to liberalism. It then explains the nature of the family, emphasizing the features recognized by natural law theorists and evolutionary psychology alike. Finally it shows how egalitarian socialism is inherently incompatible with the family, but also how the liberal individualism embraced by too many modern conservatives is precisely what paved the way for the egalitarian assault on the family.

"Tony, thank you for taking the time to read my posts. I am not clear on what issues you think I am fusing, but I THINK it is that i did not distinguish formal heresy from the ecclesiastical crime of heresy.      If I understand you correctly, I would say that my posts presume a case where a person does not consider his views to be heretical (as I would presume was the case with Honorius). I understand that a person could admit to knowing his view was heretical, and hold to it obstinately, and it be formal without ever being denounced by ecclesial authority.      So I accept that in principle the ecclesiastical crime of heresy and formal heresy are different. BUT, it seems to me that where a person does not take his view to be heretical, they basically conflate. The debate then would be whether a judgment by an authority is needed for us to discern whether or not they had sufficient basis to know the view was heretical. I THINK this might be where you and I disagree.      I would certainly acknowledge that one COULD be aware, in reality, that his view was heretical without such a judgment. But could anyone outside of the person himself sufficiently discern that? That is the question. My view would be that the only way we could know this definitively is if a judgment was made against the person, and he remained in his error.      And I think this then applies to the case of Honorius (BTW, elsewhere I noted Erick's point that there is the additional issue of no council having declared on monothelitism yet at the time of Honorius' letter, an additional wrinkle). I did state in places that I realize Feser was not addressing as such the distinction between formal and material heresy. I raise it to point out that in principle one could be anathematized on material heresy alone where that was not a clear understanding of this distinction, but such an anathema in retrospect is problematic. So that would prompt a further discussion as to given that the Church never later teaches anything not already implicitly supported by the defined deposit of faith, we must presume that those condemning Honorius would in fact be aware of something like material and formal heresy distinction, and still condemned him anyway.      My contention would be that we should not take their condemnation as proof that a pope could be guilty of teaching something sufficiently close to formal heresy, as I THINK you are suggesting. Rather, I would be inclined to do the reverse. Given that what the Church herself now implies (as I take it) about the relationship between formal heresy and the ecclesiastical crime of heresy (in cases where the person does not consider his view heretical), we can see that cases such as Honorius' prompted the need to develop the formal/material distinction more clearly. I think it is also fair to say that over time the Church has come to be procedurally more rigorous in understanding teachings to be DEFINITIVE only when formally pronounced in councils or ex catheda, even if we can contend that there can be infallible doctrine not so explicitly defined. But the ability to judge a person in relation to what they hold in such doctrines does in fact seem to differ when certain distinction and juridical procedures are more defined than they appear to have been in the time of Honorius' condemnation.",tony thank taking time read post clear issue think fusing think distinguish formal heresy ecclesiastical crime heresy understand correctly would say post presume case person consider view heretical would presume case honorius understand person could admit knowing view heretical hold obstinately formal without ever denounced ecclesial authority accept principle ecclesiastical crime heresy formal heresy different seems person take view heretical basically conflate debate would whether judgment authority needed u discern whether sufficient basis know view heretical think might disagree would certainly acknowledge one could aware reality view heretical without judgment could anyone outside person sufficiently discern question view would way could know definitively judgment made person remained error think applies case honorius btw elsewhere noted point additional issue council declared monothelitism yet time letter additional wrinkle state place realize feser addressing distinction formal material heresy raise point principle one could anathematized material heresy alone clear understanding distinction anathema retrospect problematic would prompt discussion given church never later teach anything already implicitly supported defined deposit faith must presume condemning honorius would fact aware something like material formal heresy distinction still condemned anyway contention would take condemnation proof pope could guilty teaching something sufficiently close formal heresy think suggesting rather would inclined reverse given church implies take relationship formal heresy ecclesiastical crime heresy case person consider view heretical see case prompted need develop formalmaterial distinction clearly think also fair say time church come procedurally rigorous understanding teaching definitive formally pronounced council ex catheda even contend infallible doctrine explicitly defined ability judge person relation hold doctrine fact seem differ certain distinction juridical procedure defined appear time condemnation,feser,3344,0,2215

"The primary locus of teaching authority - with the force of certainty and which commands the assent of faith - is in God Himself. The _derivative_ ""primary"" locus of that authority is in _the Church_ , to whom He granted teaching authority and to whom he gives protective grace and inspiration, and whom has Jesus Christ as her Head. This is the magisterial authority of the Church, and in this rests the magisterial office of the Church. The bishops - each bishop - _participate_ in the exercise of that magisterial office when they teach in His name, and to those teachings we normally owe religious assent. The pope exercises that magisterial office in a particular (extraordinary) way when he teaches infallibly in an ex cathedra declaration, to which we owe unreserved assent; he also exercises the magisterial office in a most excellent _ordinary_ way when he teaches in an ordinary way _what the Church teaches_ , to which we owe a particularly high degree of religious assent according to the manner in which he manifests his call to receive that teaching. While the pope can, by his special office, call us to a most fulsome **degree** of religious assent to a teaching, a higher degree than that to which individual bishops normally can call us, the _general nature_ of that assent remains religious assent, which is not of the same KIND as the unreserved assent we give to those infallible teachings that call for divine and catholic faith. The pope, like the bishops, always participates in the charism granted by Christ to the Church in her teaching authority, when he teaches in a way that calls forth our assent (either unreserved or the lesser kind in religious assent).      I would propose that it is a better way of speaking to say that Pope Francis does not have ""a magisterium"" that is distinct in number from the magisterium as exercised by Pope Benedict, JPII, JPI, Paul IV, Pius XII, or Peter.

"Just for clarity's sake: 1. I am not the Anonymous who posted at 4:01pm, I am the Anonymous who posted at 4:44 pm, so: call me ""Forty-four"".      2\. Also for clarity's sake, I DO NOT believe that Hell is empty, and I do accept the weight of Tradition.      However, so far as I am aware (and this is of course limited - I have not read most of the Fathers & Doctors), there is no specific biblical passage that tells us in certain and definitive terms that THERE ARE some in Hell. It is, therefore, (so far as I know), remotely, vaguely possible to suggest that the biblical passages that point toward Hell are all to be understood as contingent: e.g. contingent on the sinner(s) not repenting.      _More than this, the scenario is *not possible* given the fact that Christ has revealed to us than many will in fact follow the path to destruction._      For all those huge numbers on the road to destruction, they will REACH destruction...if they do not repent. Suppose that **every single** person on Earth (other than Christ and Mary) will be on that road at some point in their lives, and so that road is very, very wide, and heavily populated. But we also know that SOME who are on that road turn around and head the other way - they repent.      Therefore, not everyone who is on the road to destruction _reaches_ destruction. What if 90% who are on the road right now, repent: the heavy population of the road right now tells us nothing about the ratio of those who end up in hell. What if it's 99%? What if it's 100% who repent?      Christ will, at the end of time, judge all people. Those who are judged to be goats will go off to final perdition. What if the class of ""the goats"" happens to have no members - an empty set? The _class_ is still a valid concept, because of the contingent possibility that some might not have repented.      I repeat: I don't think this what the weight of Tradition is pointing toward. I think that Christ **repeatedly** pointed out the dangers of Hell because there ARE people going to Hell.

"@Walter      You are only different after the decision, not before. The decision is itself a self-determination to a possibility. The self-determination does not exist until actually willed. Hence why it is free. We can conceive different outcomes because the determination is not there until it is there; there is a real sense in which the agent creates the determination. This is the reason I emphasized simultaneous agent causation as well as equivocal causation. Event causation gets you a vicious regress or no real decision at all.      As far as ""randomness"" goes, that would only hold if you assume the outcomes already have some nascent individually determinate reality that are coin flipped between, which is not the case here; moreover the possibilities considered altogether can also be viewed as a region that an agent's individual determinations are bounded by.      Further, a distribution of an agent's decisions does not tell you by what means they come about. Heads on a coin flip is not determined by P(H)=0.5. It's determined by the physics of an actual flip; P(H) tends to 0.5 given the symmetry of a coin.      With respect to an agent, given their beliefs and their character you can have a rough idea of how they will act; but that would just constitute the boundaries of decisions, not the actual act of self-determination itself.      The relevance to divine simplicity is quite clear since this issue is integral to analogously understanding God's will and freedom in relation to modal collapse.      @JoeD      The objection begs the question. The choice does not exist in the agent somehow that is then univocally transmitted into the outcome, which is what the objection requires.      The choice is in fact created in a certain sense and reflects a way the agent can self determine. Prior to the choice there is nothing and no self- determination. There is no contrastive otherwise possible here. Hence the actual free willing is sufficient to explain the choice because it is coincident with the choice. Self-determination is something like marking off a number in a continuous region, not picking a stone out of a discrete pile of stones. The determination and the decision are one in the same thing, not two events, and so the sui generis willings are relevantly explanatory.",walter different decision decision self-determination possibility self-determination exist actually willed hence free conceive different outcome determination real sense agent creates determination reason emphasized simultaneous agent causation well equivocal causation event causation get vicious regress real decision far randomness go would hold assume outcome already nascent individually determinate reality coin flipped case moreover possibility considered altogether also viewed region individual determination bounded distribution decision tell mean come head coin flip determined ph determined physic actual flip ph tends given symmetry coin respect agent given belief character rough idea act would constitute boundary decision actual act self-determination relevance divine simplicity quite clear since issue integral analogously understanding freedom relation modal collapse joed objection begs question choice exist agent somehow univocally transmitted outcome objection requires choice fact created certain sense reflects way agent self determine prior choice nothing self- determination contrastive otherwise possible hence actual free willing sufficient explain choice coincident choice self-determination something like marking number continuous region picking stone discrete pile stone determination decision one thing two event sui generis willing relevantly explanatory,feser,2309,0,2222

"@ StardustyPsyche,      ""According to relativity c, the speed of light in a vacuum, is an absolute speed limit. Thus far, all experiments performed confirm this.""      Take two cities in the US. People at rest in those cities and at rest between them measure their spatial separation as 1000 miles. A clock on a photon measures the time to travel between the two cities as 0. This is infinite speed even though the people at rest measure the speed of the photon as c. The photon measures 0 elapsed time wherever it goes.      Your particle accelerator example considers only the reference frame of the experimenters. In fact, we measure the lifetime of unstable particles approaching the speed of light in an accelerator to be longer than the same particles at rest.

"Talmid, it makes sense. I like how you’re sticking to God’s choice even though the same point might be more easily made regarding human choice but in a different context (ethics, psychology). I’m not sure if those who deny good or evil have another route that they’d take though. It seems that an intelligent materialist would believe our choices are for survival or determined by brain synapses. They could push back by saying choice is a fictional concept and thus cannot be applied to the first cause.

"This morning, however, I noticed that one can also take the idea of discounting small probabilities more literally and still get the exact same results as by trimming utility functions. Specifically, given a probability function _P_ and a probability discount threshold _ϵ_ , we form a credence function _P_ _ϵ_ by letting _P_ _ϵ_ ( _A_ ) = _P_ ( _A_ ) if _ϵ_ ≤ _P_ ( _A_ ) ≤ 1 − _ϵ_ , _P_ _ϵ_ ( _A_ ) = 0 if _P_ ( _A_ ) < _ϵ_ and _P_ _ϵ_ ( _A_ ) = 1 if _P_ ( _A_ ) > 1 − _ϵ_.

Again, pulling cards from a fair deck would be an example. But much of what happens in nature does not amount to a chance set-up in this sense.

"Like for example as you travel more to the east of the world in Asia, and even some parts of Europe, you'll find that Catholics are very hostile towards Protestants even more then they are to people of other faiths, not in the violent sense but in the firm kind of unwavering some sense.      In many of these areas, the people have a very strong devotion to Mother Mary, so strong that whenever any Protestant comes trotting along to try and convert them, they immediately shut the door on them, not even giving them a chance to speak cause they don't want to hear a thing against Mother Mary, now attitudes like this aren't enforced by the state or church rather they have a very social basis or foundation enforced by the community.      And they are effective at preserving the existence of those traditions and values even though harsh.      Catholics in some of these areas are particularly harsher towards Protestants because the catholics tend to be small communities and the existence of all these ever breeding protestant sects breaks or acts against the Christian Unity which ought to be present and Christianity is Catholicism, period. I think notions like this can be strongly enforced at the cultural and social level by parents, families, communities, churches such that even if it is permitted that people of other faiths propagate their faith, the catholic will never for a moment consider leaving even if you are intellectually not able to defend the faith as well as some one else or even if you aren't really intellectually inclined as a person, you will never leave the faith.      The average poor farmer who is a devout catholic and devoted to Mary, the Saints etc may not get all the intellectual nitty gritties but he will never ever abandon the faith because that's how he was brought up and cultured, in such away that no matter what befalls you be it doubt or misfortune, you never ever abandon the faith. And that's what he teaches his Children. That's the way it should be. If someone from another faith is able to convert you, it's your fault, not really the fault of the person trying to convert.      So if you cultivate strong values, the faith will get preserved and eventually even grow.      After observing the Eastern situation one does get the feeling that in the USA catholics and protestants share too much of a friendly bond. They seem to have adopted some sort of political idealism, that all they need to do is get like- minded people and they will be able to effect political change in such a way that all their demands are met. But I think that this idealism is misplaced, it seems like a certain section of the public may always be in favour of unjust practices like abortion and the like, the most that one can do is to mitigate by reducing the limit to a 14 week ban etc but it seems like barring some sensible thinkers, lots of integralists try to use situations like this to justify their position and not compromise, chasing after some idealistic Catholic state that just isn't feasible. They don't realise their refusal to compromise is what is leading to even greater negative effects.

"To be sure, there have over the centuries nevertheless been those who have tried to defend Honorius, the most eminent being St. Robert Bellarmine (in Book 4, Chapter XI of _On the Sovereign Pontiff_ ). But his arguments are weak, and were rejected by later orthodox Catholic theologians. For example, Bellarmine proposes that “perhaps” Honorius’s letter to Sergius was faked by the heretics, though he also argues that if this theory is rejected, the letter can be given an orthodox reading. But these strategies obviously conflict with one another. If the problematic parts of the letter were faked by heretics precisely for the purpose of spreading their heresy, then how can they plausibly be given an orthodox reading?

The two are not the same at all, even in our case. Second, 'compelling' reason is a metaphor; nobody is literally compelled by any reasons, which would require that reasons be efficient causes. All 'compelling reason' means is that it was a reason good enough due to its intrinsic merits that one acted on it. Because of this, while it is true that our creation shows that God had no compelling reason not to create, it is trivially true -- all it is saying is that God's making choice A shows that He didn't decide to act on the intrinsic merits of any reasons He might have had for choice B. It doesn't tell us anything about whether He had good reasons for choice B.

"I once had reason to write to my bishop about a matter of faith that needed clarification. His private, written response, delivered through his staff theologian, constituted _for me_ an expression of his will to teach me in a certain way, and his will that I accept his teaching. That it was a private letter indicated _how broadly_ he intended his instruction to bind people, but it did not detract from _whether_ he intended that I give his instruction my assent.

"UncommonDescent,      ""If you abandon an immateriality and the substantial form, the world becomes unintelligible.""      How does immateriality make anything better understood? You're making an assertion that brings no intelligibility to the table. I'd like you to explain how I need to believe in a phantom ""substance"" to make cause and effect intelligible.      ""If you abandon substantial form, you are forced into a representationalist theory of mind.""      I doubt abandoning substantial form forces me into any model. But what is so distasteful about a representationalist theory of mind? It certainly does not prevent me from claiming some knowledge about reality. We do not need to directly perceive an object to understand things about an object. We do not need to be the moon to understand the moon circles the earth, or that it's not made of cheese. A representationalist theory of mind does not affirm reality is out of bounds. It merely holds that we have to understand reality indirectly, through models. I don't have to be a rock to know at what speed a rock falls. Models are not a detriment to understanding. They are probably the only way to understand. They are probably the only practical way a brain could cope with the infinite particulars in reality. The gracious Mr. Feser makes this admission when he talks about triangles.      If you insist that indirect knowledge cannot be knowledge then you destroy your own theory of reality. You cannot directly perceive immateriality. You have no direct access to forms. You require a representationalist theory in order to posit your non-representationalist theory.      ""Living inside a representionalist theatre is the opposite of ""success"". It's an outright admission of failure.""      That's empirically false. You're communicating with me on technology that's built on a representationalist theater. If you believe I exist you believe a model of me you have created based on my posts in this forum. The ""representionalist"" technology, not immateriality, has allowed a glimpse into me. You cannot know the real me through any dualist or non-dualist theory. No theory is going to put you into my head. I don't need anyone else in my head. But if you demand that sort of reality you will be disappointed. :)      ""Knowledge is adequatio rei et intellectu."" [Truth is agreement of thing and intellect.] -- I do not have a problem with that in general. But what you mean by agreement is probably different from what I mean by agreement. I do not believe I am forever locked inside my brain and the external world is unknowable. The brain is designed to get to know the real world. There is a big difference between ""unknowable"" and not 100% knowable. Besides, your immateriality is not knowable. Your theory cannot claim omniscience. You are in the same boat with me no matter how much you protest otherwise.      ""Please explain how to solve it *without* appeals to the (magical) future.""      The future is all too real to the living. To claim it's magic is weird. I'd like elaboration on that. Of course I cannot prove what we will know in the future. But I can prove we as humans have consistently learned more as years go by, and learned it through a materialist navigation. Don't tell me you are unfamiliar with this trend. Don't tell me you believe this trend will come to a screeching halt.      ""The hylemorphist can explain the unity of the intellect""      That's false. It certainly does not explain the binding problem. I know you're comfortable with what you've got. That's the problem. You've got nothing and are comfortable with it.      ""[Computers] are not wholes. They do not 'apprehend' anything. That's why materialism is a dead end.""

"@Anonymous @Talmid According to Judaism and the first ecumenical council the Catholic Church ever held, eating meat from animals that have been abused is a mortal sin, of the same gravity as fornication or idolatry.      ""You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, **from the meat of strangled animals** and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell."" - St. James the Just (Acts 15:29)      Practically speaking, because almost all forms of mass farming in the United States are far more abusive than the relatively tame practice of merely strangling animals of Ancient Rome, this means that anyone who knowingly buys meat from a mass farm or mass food supplier like Sysco (via a restaurant), knowing what the first church council wrote, with full consent of the will, has committed a mortal sin. In order to avoid falling into mortal sin, you must eat vegan whenever you eat out (or reduce animal product intake as much as possible) or buy animal products only from Kosher or Halal delis (because Jews and Muslims still hold fast to these rules).

"SeanJanuary 11, 2023 at 10:31 AM   ""In what way was Aristotle wrong about motion?""   Aristotle was fundamentally wrong in asserting that sublunary motion is in an impeding medium such that a moving object requires a mover to account for its motion.      This fundamental error of Aristotle is repeated by Aquinas in the First Way in the example of the staff and hand, wherein Aquinas asserts that the staff moves ""only"" because it is moved by the hand, which is clearly false.      This fundamental error of Aristotle, repeated by Aquinas, leads to the unsound argument for the first mover.      The truth is that all motion is in space. You are in space. We are all in space. Motion is never lost, only transferred or transformed. An object once set in motion will continue moving ad infinitum unless its motion is transferred or transformed.      Aristotle had the notion of ad infinitum motion in his grasp, as expressed in his Physics book 4, but he discounted the notion of the void, thinking, among other things, that speed would go to infinity absent the sublunary impeding medium.      Aristotle was not an atomist, and thus had no understanding that heat and temperature are functions of molecular or atomic motion, which progresses losslessly in space, thus negating the argument from motion for a first mover.",seanjanuary way aristotle wrong motion aristotle fundamentally wrong asserting sublunary motion impeding medium moving object requires mover account motion fundamental error aristotle repeated aquinas first way example staff hand wherein aquinas asserts staff move moved hand clearly false fundamental error aristotle repeated aquinas lead unsound argument first mover truth motion space space space motion never lost transferred transformed object set motion continue moving ad infinitum unless motion transferred transformed aristotle notion ad infinitum motion grasp expressed physic book discounted notion void thinking among thing speed would go infinity absent sublunary impeding medium aristotle atomist thus understanding heat temperature function molecular atomic motion progress losslessly space thus negating argument motion first mover,feser,1320,0,2275

"RunDec: ""I am confident that God cannot do that because it would be immoral.""      Wherein is your confidence grounded? Rather than (and prior to) ""immoral,"" it would seem to be utterly pointless (inconceivable in relation to causal finality) and incoherent, and as such metaphysically impossible, on the presupposition of a sound (essentialist) metaphysical understanding of good (as fulfillment) and evil (as privation). But the same applies to your trying to hold God-as-a-moral-agent to your standards of morality and rationality -- it's not metaphysically possible that your confidence in doing so could be warranted. Given your metaphysical relationship to God, it doesn't make sense. So your claim, that ""the problem of evil is a challenge to God's existence,"" is ambiguous: if you regard it as equivalent to ""I have a problem reconciling my views about evil and about the nature of God,"" fine, that's a subjective report, but the post here addresses that problem; if it means ""there's a real problem here for which we have no adequate solution,"" then I think you're mistaken and possibly begging the question. And it seems your so-called ""ceteris paribus necessary moral truths"" are still clearly not (metaphysically) necessary moral truths (indeed, they're simply false), since so far as I can see your ceteris paribus clause is necessarily counterfactual (the ""other things"" are in fact ""not equal"").",rundec confident god can not would immoral wherein confidence grounded rather prior immoral would seem utterly pointless inconceivable relation causal finality incoherent metaphysically impossible presupposition sound essentialist metaphysical understanding good fulfillment evil privation applies trying hold god-as-a-moral-agent standard morality rationality -- metaphysically possible confidence could warranted given metaphysical relationship god make sense claim problem evil challenge existence ambiguous regard equivalent problem reconciling view evil nature god fine subjective report post address problem mean there real problem adequate solution think mistaken possibly begging question seems so-called ceteris paribus necessary moral truth still clearly metaphysically necessary moral truth indeed simply false since far see ceteris paribus clause necessarily counterfactual thing fact equal,feser,1410,0,2278

"@ the emperor with no clothes      Okay, Walter, now that we have established that the emperor is walking around in the buff, let's try to put some clothes back on him.      You wrote:      ""theism cannot explain the rules of logic either and cannot take them as seperate entities because there are no entities that are truly seperate from God.""      As I pointed out above, theism is not pantheism, so you need to work on that distinction between credible, reliable witnesses and non-credible witnesses in order to have better discernment about who to listen to about what is or is not ""Theism"". Now that we have cleared this up, we can address the final false statement in your response (You squeezed in quite a few in that little post).      You claimed that theism has no means of accounting for the rules of logic. Well, you got that one wrong as well. Theism is the *only* means of accounting for the rules of logic. Let's recap on where we have gotten so far. It is clear, for reasons noted above, that the laws of logic exist. Anyone making an argument presupposes this. It is also clear, for reasons noted above, that the laws of logic are not material. Walter does not have them buried in his basement (In fact if they were anywhere, it is clear from the foregoing that they are not at Walter's house).      So, we have laws that exist and are immaterial. Along with this, these laws do not change from place to place or over time. They are eternal. They are not contingent on change in the material world. Yet these laws, just like numbers, have real implications in the material world.      The principle of non-contradiction is not *merely* a principle of thought. It also permeates material being. It is for this reason that no one has ever seen a non-chair-chair or a square circle or a married bachelor. They are impossible to conceptualize and they are impossible to be (or exist).      So, if these principles effect being and yet seem also to be mind dependent, how else do we account for them except by an eternal mind? Now Mr. Walter, if you have read your Edward Feser, you should be having flashbacks at this point because Dr. Feser makes precisely this argument with regard to numbers and other abstract objects in Five Proofs. He aptly refers to it as the Augustinian argument. Now we have cleared up the last of your string of misunderstandings. In the future, perhaps you might pause and reflect on whether or not it is cogent to try to convince us that your keyboard does not exist by means of typing on it.      Now, Mr. Don Jindra.

"Obviously, one can go too far. A virtue is a mean between extremes, and just as one can be too _quick_ to attribute evil to others, so too can one be too _slow_ to do so. Aquinas does not say that we should _never_ judge another to have a bad motive. He says that we should not do so _if_ we lack sufficient evidence to make a certain judgment about the matter, _if_ our judgment tends to be clouded by dislike of the person, and so on. But with some people, it is possible dispassionately and objectively to judge from their patterns of behavior over time that they are indeed acting from bad motives. There is no sin in making such a judgment under such circumstances. On the contrary, a habitual refusal to do so can be a vice. As [I have discussed elsewhere](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2019/11/against-candy-ass- christianity.html), Aquinas argues that just as one can sin by being excessively angry or insufficiently affable or friendly, so too can one sin by being _insufficiently_ angry and _excessively_ affable in the face of grave evil. Dogmatic non-judgmentalism would be a similar moral failing. It is not Christ’s teaching, but a distortion of that teaching.",obviously one go far virtue mean extreme one quick attribute evil others one slow aquinas say never judge another bad motive say lack sufficient evidence make certain judgment matter judgment tends clouded dislike person people possible dispassionately objectively judge pattern behavior time indeed acting bad motif sin making judgment circumstance contrary habitual refusal vice discussed elsewherehttpsedwardfeserblogspotcomagainst-candy-ass- christianityhtml aquinas argues one sin excessively angry insufficiently affable friendly one sin insufficiently angry excessively affable face grave evil dogmatic non-judgmentalism would similar moral failing teaching distortion teaching,feser,1177,0,2288

"Your post reminded me of Heinrich Heine's comments on Kant's life/philosophy. The quote is from Heine's book ""Religion and Philosophy in Germany: A Fragment"". It's on pages 108-109 on this online version. https://archive.org/details/religionandphilo00heinuoft/page/108/mode/2up      “The history of Immanuel Kant's life is difficult to portray, for he had neither life nor history. He led a mechanical, regular, almost abstract bachelor existence in a little retired street of Königsberg, an old town on the north-eastern frontier of Germany. I do not believe that the great clock of the cathedral performed in a more passionless and methodical manner its daily routine than did its townsman, Immanuel Kant. Rising in the morning, coffee-drinking, writing, reading lectures, dining, walking, everything had its appointed time, and the neighbors knew that it was exactly half-past three o'clock when Kant stepped forth from his house in his grey, tight-fitting coat, with his Spanish cane in his hand, and betook himself to the little linden avenue called after him to this day the ""Philosopher's Walk."" Summer and winter he walked up and down it eight times, and when the weather was dull or heavy clouds prognosticated rain, the townspeople beheld his servant, the old Lampe, trudging anxiously behind Kant with a big umbrella under his arm, like an image of Providence.      What a strange contrast did this man's outward life present to his destructive, world-annihilating thoughts! In sooth, had the citizens of Königsberg had the least presentiment of the full significance of his ideas, they would have felt far more awful dread at the presence of this man than at the sight of an executioner, who can but kill the body. But the worthy folk saw in him nothing more than a Professor of Philosophy, and as he passed at his customary hour, they greeted him in a friendly manner and set their watches by him.”   (End quote)",post reminded heinrich comment lifephilosophy quote book religion philosophy germany fragment page - online version httpsarchiveorgdetailsreligionandphiloheinuoftpagemodeup “ the history immanuel life difficult portray neither life history led mechanical regular almost abstract bachelor existence little retired street königsberg old town north-eastern frontier germany believe great clock cathedral performed passionless methodical manner daily routine townsman immanuel kant rising morning coffee-drinking writing reading lecture dining walking everything appointed time neighbor knew exactly half-past three clock kant stepped forth house grey tight-fitting coat spanish cane hand betook little linden avenue called day philosopher walk summer winter walked eight time weather dull heavy cloud prognosticated rain townspeople beheld servant old lampe trudging anxiously behind kant big umbrella arm like image providence strange contrast outward life present destructive world-annihilating thought sooth citizen königsberg least presentiment full significance idea would felt far awful dread presence man sight executioner kill body worthy folk saw nothing professor philosophy passed customary hour greeted friendly manner set watch him ” end quote,feser,1925,0,2299

The teleological approach is also lacking in Aristotle's purely secularist view.

"'Levels of actuality' just seems to be verbiage for saying 'actualities potential to actualities'. Potentiality is not some random thing that Aristotelians posit; it indicates the fact that in change things that stay the same have to be capable of things that don't stay the same. If you have that, the capability is what people are calling potentiality, regardless of what words are used for it.      Thus your real argument just seems to be a rejection of prime matter as being identified with passive potentiality. Prime matter is a conclusion arising from two lines of argument, (1) no infinite regress in material causes, and (2) something must be the subject of change in substantial change. Both of these arguments still go through on your account: there are first material causes (your 'ultimate physical forms') which remain the same in substantial change. You just are arguing that prime matter consists entirely of immaterial forms (= actualities without material causes) that are eternal and unchanging (because otherwise they would require a subject of change).",level seems verbiage saying actuality potential potentiality random thing aristotelian posit indicates fact change thing stay capable thing stay capability people calling potentiality regardless word used thus real argument seems rejection prime matter identified passive potentiality prime matter conclusion arising two line argument infinite regress material cause something must subject change substantial change argument still go account first material cause ultimate physical remain substantial change arguing prime matter consists entirely immaterial form actuality without material cause eternal unchanging otherwise would require subject change,feser,1074,0,2305

" _Gender is not a biological concept, but a grammatical one. In Indo-European and Semitic languages (and a few others), all nouns have a gender: male or female, or occasionally male, female, and neuter...But because characters in fiction are never neuter (and even neuter characters take on a preferred gender), it follows that personality types only come in male or female,_      Unless there is something essential that language is bound by, there is no particular reason grammar could not have 10 or 20 grammatical genders, and there would be no reason why the grammatical genders are correlated to the biological sexes _at all_. It is because there IS something essential that language is tied to - at least in terms of animals and humans - in correlating grammatical gender to the sexes that explains why there are only ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" and ""neither of those"" in grammar. Grammar has other characteristics, such as singular and plural, that DON'T correlate (at all) to the sex of the object. Grammatical ""gender"" also could be not tied in at all with biological sex, if it weren't for some underpinning reality that grammatical gender is tied to that IS connected to biological sex, _at least in part_ , for animals and humans.      _What I think is happening with people with gender dysphoria is that as they're developing their personality type, they realize that their type is a different gender than their biological sex. There's nothing that says God is obligated to assign you a personality type that aligns with your gender, because God doesn't practice physiognomy._      You can't have it both ways. If ""personality types"" can **only** be male or female, it is because there is something that _constrains_ personality types to that utterly binary range of options. Nobody can plausibly propose WHAT is the principle that constrains us to that range of options, other than biological sex. Hence there is no plausible alternative proposal for what _gender_ you ARE, other than: (a) you are the gender that is given by your biological sex, or (b) your gender is a damaged and dysfunctional approach to the gender that is given by your biological sex.      Thee is nothing that says God is obliged to make sure every person is born healthy and hale in all respects: Providence (manifestly) allows that many individuals are born with deformities that impede their full elaboration as wholly complete, healthy human adults. This says nothing at all about the criteria that determine WHAT IS a wholly complete, healthy human adult. A boy born without a leg isn't a new species whose normal, healthy ""type"" is characterized as being one-legged, he is a human whose normal, healthy type is two-legged, but he has a birth defect. It's not _God_ who is constrained to create only human beings, it's that because human nature entails that individuals be biologically male or female (or be damaged in their individual expression of human nature), _when God produces humans_ then they are either formed to be men or women (or damaged in their expression of human nature).",gender biological concept grammatical one indo-european semitic language others noun gender male female occasionally male female neuterbut character fiction never neuter even neuter character take preferred gender follows personality type come male female unless something essential language bound particular reason grammar could grammatical gender would reason grammatical gender correlated biological sex something essential language tied - least term animal human - correlating grammatical gender sex explains masculine feminine neither grammar grammar characteristic singular plural correlate sex object grammatical gender also could tied biological sex underpinning reality grammatical gender tied connected biological sex least part animal human think happening people gender dysphoria developing personality type realize type different gender biological sex nothing say god obligated assign personality type aligns gender god practice physiognomy way personality type male female something constrains personality type utterly binary range option nobody plausibly propose principle constrains u range option biological sex hence plausible alternative proposal gender gender given biological sex b gender damaged dysfunctional approach gender given biological sex thee nothing say god obliged make sure every person born healthy hale respect providence manifestly allows many individual born deformity impede full elaboration wholly complete healthy human adult say nothing criterion determine wholly complete healthy human adult boy born without leg new specie whose normal healthy type characterized one-legged human whose normal healthy type two-legged birth defect god constrained create human being human nature entail individual biologically male female damaged individual expression human nature god produce human either formed men woman damaged expression human nature,feser,3081,0,2310

" _You say that, if there is disagreement among the bishops, the only practical infallible organ [on that disputed point] is a General Council confirmed by the Pope or an ex cathedra statement._      Agreed. This does not prevent there to be a dispute about something that had already been taught infallibly earlier. Indeed, Councils have often needed to repeat and re-state the very same dogmatic teaching that a previous Council had made a definitive, infallible teaching: because people continued to dispute with the earlier teaching. In such a situation, _ordinary_ teaching by bishops won't ""settle"" the issue. You need extraordinary teaching authority, and you may need several rounds of it EVEN THOUGH each round is capable of infallibility all on its own. De facto and de jure are distinct: ""has been accepted"" is not the same as ""SHOULD have been accepted"".      _However, as I mentioned, such declarations do not merely amount to infallible statements concerning the history of the ordinary magisterium of the bishops._      Agreed. Before the aftermath of Ordinatio Sacerdotalis, (so far as I know) the organs of the Church never attempted to **officially** declare that that ""this dogmatic truth has been taught infallibly by the ordinary magisterium of the bishops throughout the world"". And in fact, it would be a _particularly bad idea_ for a pope to attempt an _Ex Cathedra_ declaration that ""this truth had been taught infallibly through the ordinary magisterium"", not least because post-Apostolic HISTORICAL truth is not a normal object of divine revelation about which the Church exercises infallible teaching. No: ex cathedra teachings do not have the _history_ of the teaching as their formal object, they have the truth of the faith as their formal object. I have made this point extensively in my own blogging.      I have also made the express point that Pope JPII could not set the matter of women's ordination beyond doubt (which was his express purpose) WITHOUT giving the teaching as an ex cathedra statement. So, in light of the fact that he used ALL the necessary forms of giving an ex cathedra declaration in Ordinatio Sacerdotalis, the fact that _later on_ the CDF asserted that the teaching _had already been taught infallibly_ DID NOT refute the fact that Ordinatio Sacerdotalis **also** taught infallibly that the Church cannot ordain women as priests.      My _underlying_ point remains standing: when a pope simply repeats a teaching that has ALREADY been infallibly taught by the Church, this is just an ordinary kind of ordinary magisterial act, and this is _of the same nature_ as other bishops also repeating that same teaching, who themselves also carry out ordinary magisterial acts of the teaching Church. His teaching act is an ordinary act of the magisterial office of the Church.",say disagreement among bishop practical infallible organ disputed point general council confirmed pope ex cathedra statement agreed prevent dispute something already taught infallibly earlier indeed council often needed repeat re-state dogmatic teaching previous council made definitive infallible teaching people continued dispute earlier teaching situation ordinary teaching bishop settle issue need extraordinary teaching authority may need several round even though round capable infallibility de facto de jure distinct accepted accepted however mentioned declaration merely amount infallible statement concerning history ordinary magisterium bishop agreed aftermath ordinatio sacerdotalis far know organ church never attempted officially declare dogmatic truth taught infallibly ordinary magisterium bishop throughout world fact would particularly bad idea pope attempt ex cathedra declaration truth taught infallibly ordinary magisterium least post-apostolic historical truth normal object divine revelation church exercise infallible teaching ex cathedra teaching history teaching formal object truth faith formal object made point extensively blogging also made express point pope jpii could set matter ordination beyond doubt express purpose without giving teaching ex cathedra statement light fact used necessary form giving ex cathedra declaration ordinatio sacerdotalis fact later cdf asserted teaching already taught infallibly refute fact ordinatio sacerdotalis also taught infallibly church can not ordain woman priest underlying point remains standing pope simply repeat teaching already infallibly taught church ordinary kind ordinary magisterial act nature bishop also repeating teaching also carry ordinary magisterial act teaching church teaching act ordinary act magisterial office church,feser,2825,0,2313

So the view would be that there are moral norms of combination and overall norms of combination, both of which take into account exactly the same first order considerations, but sometimes come to different conclusions because they weigh the very same first order considerations differently (e.g., in the case where a moderate amount of _F_ -considerations needs to be sacrificed for a moderate amount of good for one’s children).",morality say obligatory permitted thus morality already weighs f paradigmatically moral concern provides combination verdict word already moral norm combination view would moral norm combination overall norm combination take account exactly first order consideration sometimes come different conclusion weigh first order consideration differently eg case moderate amount f -considerations need sacrificed moderate amount good child,pruss,660,1,2321

"Vincent,      You mention souls having to be branded by their bodies - nevertheless, once the soul loses the body, it CONTINUES TO EXIST. Which would be sufficient to refute the idea that existence is the same as material exemplifications. That seems obvious to me. If you wanna say things exist because they have matter, you cannot say that a disembodied soul can exist or continue to exist; at most you can say that such a soul has existed before, but no longer exists, if it no longer has matter.   Saying angels also have prime matter is okay but that'd just be another cost for a position that seems implausible and frankly doesn't seem to accomplish much.      ""As for God, His essence and existence are commonly held to be identical, anyway.""      But God is not material. So it just seems bizarre to suggest that existence comes from prime matter.      And overall, I cannot quite make sense of what you are suggesting except if we are just calling ""Existence"" ""Matter"". In that case, the form will be the Essence and Matter will be ""Existence"" and you have only a semantic difference.      The whole point of the Essence x Existence distinction, in a nutshell, is that there is a real actuality that is the ""oomph"" of things existing. When you consider a unicorn, you can understand what it is without knowing whether it actually exists or not. This is so because its existence is not the same as its essence. Sure, the unicorn's existence qua unicorn involves material exemplification, but there might be things which exist without matter (as the examples I gave), and in any case we are just trying to maintain a principle of actuality/reality here. You seem to just be turning that principle into matter. One could make more objections from the nature of prime matter and how it can be changed etc., but it's not even clear to me what you're trying to accomplish with that, and how you would avoid the arguments for a real distinction (if you really are trying to abandon it).      ""What I insist is that God's Mind or Essence has multiple thoughts and intentions which are contingent accidents - e.g. God's concept of this universe, and His intention to make it.""      But where do these accidents come from? They could only be caused by the divine essence, but then God would just be the simple essence anyway. And it seems impossible for the accidents to come about, since they would have to actualize God somehow (in the way accidents actualize the subjects), but God as pure actuality (the simple essence as you admitted) would not be able to be actualized by accidents. To put it differently: I worry that God could only cause himself parts if he already had parts in the first place (a potential to receive the actuality of the accidents/be modified by the accidents), so it would be viciously circular.   Another worry I have is that the First Cause would already prepossess in itself the actualities of the accidents it would cause, but then, what's the point? And it would be the case of a something actualizing itself, which is impossible.      ""an agent's choice to do something must be (at least logically, even if not temporally) preceded by a plan or intention to do it. ""      If intentions do not determine the choice, then it seems you are treating intentions as if they were non-determining motives or predispositions. But then the classical theist can agree that God DOES have these intentions. I certainly believe that, at least. To me, God created this universe because he was impressed by reasons R, and his being impressed by reasons R is not a contingent fact, but a necessary one. God is impressed by R in every world.      So what's the issue? Classical theists need not deny that God has intentions to act. If you accept the fact that God can create different things in different worlds without there having to be any differences in intrinsic properties in God between these worlds as he chooses what to create (something you should accept if you accept LFW) then what is the problem?

"@Miguel      It might be framed this way: Under what conditions do we ""instruct the ignorant"" and under what conditions to we ""rebuke the sinner"". The simple answer to each of these questions is straight forward. We do the former when dealing with someone who is ignorant (but not malicious) and that latter when someone is a sinner (i.e. malicious but not ignorant; they know it is wrong and don't really care). This entails that we are able to recognize and distinguish malice and ignorance. I think learning to do this effectively is critical for being able to effectively win people to the truth. If you rebuke a sincerely mistaken person for their mistake, this is unnecessary. Such a person just needs instruction. If you give instruction to a malicious person, this is uneffective because they don't care at all about the truth. Such a person doesn't need to be taught, he needs to be rebuked. This lies behind Aristotle's saying that we should not argue with those who deny manifest principles. Such folks need ""the rod"" and not instruction.

"Hi Ed,      The book looks very interesting, especially Section 2. Not being able to afford the sticker price, I decided to have a look at Rob Koons' Youtube video, ""The best case for God's existence"" (May 2, 2020), at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVgbCIJ9Fxo. Dr. Koons is very learned man, but his case for God raises some questions.      At 10:00, Dr. Koons argues that there can be no such thing as a self- explanatory fact. He claims there is/are some fact(s) that need(s) no explanation. He regards God's existence as such a fact. Would you concur, or would you argue that Koons' strategy simply makes God the Ultimate Brute Fact?      At 17:50, Koons argues for a restricted version of PSR: all natural things require an explanation. From this, he says, I can know a priori that I need an explanation, because I can know a priori that I'm not God. As he puts it: ""If everything except God has to have a cause, then I'm good to go"" (18:00). But this assumes that we have a clear idea at the outset of what ""natural"" means, and what ""God"" means.      Dr. Koons also defends the kalam version of the cosmological argument, but at 47:00, he not only admits that it could be denied by rejecting David Lewis's Patchwork Principle (that scenarios that are “patched” together from other possible scenarios are themselves possible), but undercuts his own case by declaring that he himself doesn't regard the Patchwork Principle as true without exception. Some might say that's ad hoc.      At 51:08, Koons argues that a totality of contingent facts requires an explanation, but this principle is plausible only if the facts in question form a natural whole. He needs to establish that.      At 57:36, Koons responds to the Gap Problem by arguing that any exception to the PSR must be simple and boundless, hence non-physical and infinite in power, and then at 58:31, argues that such a Being COULD BE intelligent if all truths are present to Him immediately and non-representationally, without the need for Him to infer anything. But ""could be"" doesn't imply ""is."" And Koons nowhere defines ""intelligent."" Nor does he explain how God's believing all these truths counts as knowledge if there isn't the right causal connection (1:14:44) between God and these truths.      I conclude that Dr. Koons' case is incomplete.

"Same with the two-slit experiment. What we can say with confidence is simply that there are some weird phenomena here. But how to interpret them is another story. Yes, there is something here that in some respects behaves in a wavelike way and in other respects in a particle-like way. But by no means does that entail that it is, say, both a particle and not a particle at the same time, or that it is neither a particle nor a non-particle. Here too, you _could_ try to make the case that we should interpret what is going on in a way that rejects either LNC or LEM.

"@WCB      Wow. An argument against God's existence that no one has ever thought of before. That is truly remarkable. Surely others have recognized your immense brilliance. You must have a dozen publishers pounding at your doors waiting for you to produce this devastating critique of theism. How do you decide between all the offers you must have? Are you overwhelmed by all the publicity from your singular brilliance? Is that the reason that you don't reveal your real name? Perhaps because we would all be overcome by your rock star status as a philosopher and theologian?      Let's see what widely renowned thinkers do I know that have the initials WCB? Ah, that's right. No one. That is the reason that you are not taken seriously here (anywhere?). That is the reason that Ya'kov referred to you as a ""notorious troll."" From my limited interaction with you, that description fits the bill quite neatly.      However, there is more that can be said and Tom Cohoe has said this well, ""Ever seeing and never perceiving."" That fits the bill quite well also.      But there is no doubt some spark within you that does not want to be an obnoxious troll who is under sad delusions of grandeur. Why not try to follow that spark? Why not stop pretending that you are clever when those around you are not fooled?      Regarding St. Augustine's argument, it addresses the point that God would know the state of the world at creation. After all God knows the state of the world past, present, and future, so despite your inept assertions otherwise, this point has not eluded theologians preceding nominalism or Luther or certainly not you. So why don't you stop pretending? It isn't fooling anyone.      The suggestion that St. Augustine abandoned his account of free will later in his career is a sad trope in older reformed Protestant theology. Your repetition of this sad trope shows that you are most certainly not familiar with the secondary literature on these issues. The account of the will found in his early Cassiacum Dialogues (On the Freedom of the Will) is maintained in his anti-Pelagian writings (e.g. On Grace and Free Will). It is also maintained in his City of God. Han Luen Kantzer Komline has traced St. Augustine on the will in Augustine on the Will: A Theological Account. This work makes clear that St. Augustine did not abandon and account on the Freedom of the Will. It really only takes a cursory reading of a few of St. Augustine's early and late works to realize this. In light of this, it is clear that you are familiar with neither St. Augustine nor the secondary literature on St. Augustine. So, again, who do you think you are fooling? Why keep pretending?      I would continue to expose the nonsense in your post, but I am left to wonder whether it would do any good in encouraging you to stop being a shameless pretender. Perhaps as a sign of goodwill, you might recognize that you have no clue what you are talking about with respect to St. Augustine. Then we can move on to other things that you have no clue about.

"“As regards opinion, whatever the Roman Pontiffs have hitherto taught, or shall hereafter teach, must be held with a firm grasp of mind, and, so often as occasion requires, must be openly professed.”      —Pope Leo XIII, Encyclical Immortale Dei, n. 41, 1885         “In defining the limits of the obedience owed to the pastors of souls, but most of all to the authority of the Roman Pontiff, it must not be supposed that it is only to be yielded in relation to dogmas of which the obstinate denial cannot be disjoined from the crime of heresy. Nay, further, it is not enough sincerely and firmly to assent to doctrines which, though not defined by any solemn pronouncement of the Church, are by her proposed to belief, as divinely revealed, in her common and universal teaching, and which the Vatican Council declared are to be believed ‘with Catholic and divine faith.’      But this likewise must be reckoned amongst the duties of Christians, that they allow themselves to be ruled and directed by the authority and leadership of bishops, and, above all, of the apostolic see. And how fitting it is that this should be so any one can easily perceive. For the things contained in the divine oracles have reference to God in part, and in part to man, and to whatever is necessary for the attainment of his eternal salvation.      Now, both these, that is to say, what we are bound to believe and what we are obliged to do, are laid down, as we have stated, by the Church using her divine right, and in the Church by the supreme Pontiff. Wherefore it belongs to the Pope to judge authoritatively what things the sacred oracles contain, as well as what doctrines are in harmony, and what in disagreement, with them; and also, for the same reason, to show forth what things are to be accepted as right, and what to be rejected as worthless; what it is necessary to do and what to avoid doing, in order to attain eternal salvation. For, otherwise, there would be no sure interpreter of the commands of God, nor would there be any safe guide showing man the way he should live.”      —Pope Leo XIII, Encyclical Sapientiae Christianae, n. 24, 1890      “It is not to be thought that what is set down in Encyclical Letters does not demand assent in itself, because in this the Popes do not exercise the supreme power of their magisterium. For, these matters are taught by the ordinary magisterium, regarding which the following is pertinent: ‘He who heareth you, heareth Me’ (Luke 10:16); and usually what is set forth and inculcated in the Encyclical Letters already pertains to Catholic doctrine. But if the Supreme Pontiffs in their acts, after due consideration, express an opinion on a hitherto controversial matter, it is clear to all that this matter, according to the mind and the will of the same Pontiffs, cannot any longer be considered a question of free discussion among the theologians.”      —Pope Pius XII Encyclical Humani Generis 1950        ",“ a regard opinion whatever roman pontiff hitherto taught shall hereafter teach must held firm grasp mind often occasion requires must openly professed ” —pope leo xiii encyclical immortale dei n “ in defining limit obedience owed pastor soul authority roman pontiff must supposed yielded relation dogma obstinate denial can not disjoined crime heresy nay enough sincerely firmly assent doctrine though defined solemn pronouncement church proposed belief divinely revealed common universal teaching vatican council declared believed ‘ with catholic divine faith likewise must reckoned amongst duty christian allow ruled directed authority leadership bishop apostolic see fitting one easily perceive thing contained divine oracle reference god part part man whatever necessary attainment eternal salvation say bound believe obliged laid stated church using divine right church supreme pontiff wherefore belongs pope judge authoritatively thing sacred oracle contain well doctrine harmony disagreement also reason show forth thing accepted right rejected worthless necessary avoid order attain eternal salvation otherwise would sure interpreter command god would safe guide showing man way live ” —pope leo xiii encyclical sapientiae christianae n “ it thought set encyclical letter demand assent pope exercise supreme power magisterium matter taught ordinary magisterium regarding following pertinent ‘ he heareth heareth luke usually set forth inculcated encyclical letter already pertains catholic doctrine supreme pontiff act due consideration express opinion hitherto controversial matter clear matter according mind pontiff can not longer considered question free discussion among theologian ” —pope pius xii encyclical humani generis,feser,2954,0,2382

"Tom:       **In other words, how do you know that natural selection is blind, other than by assuming it, in which case there is nothing that you can say? But there is a lot of randomness in the environment in which natural selection operates. How do you know that God has not set up this randomness through a process above our understanding, the infinite God's acts being above the understanding of our finite minds?**      I don't think that really works conceptually. It's certainly true that God sets up ""randomness"" to achieve His ends in ways above human understanding. The events leading to the crucifixion of Christ are an obvious example specifically identified in Scripture, for instance.      But in that case, the events aren't actually random in the relevant sense, but only _apparently_ random. But once we see the big picture, we realize they weren't really random after all.      If God orchestrated evolution to bring about humans, then it wouldn't actually be natural selection that did it. It would be a situation more analogous to human breeding, what Darwin called ""artificial selection,"" but far more elaborate.      When it comes to breeding, we don't say that natural selection isn't blind, but rather that *actual* selection is occurring. The same would apply here. Natural selection would arguably still be occurring as well (as it is in human-bred animals), but it would not be the explanation for why things turned out as they did.      One implication would be that if you were to seed life an another habitable planet, one where God was NOT orchestrating the creation of human beings, not much would happen evolutionarily, because natural selection in and of itself doesn't explain function.",tom word know natural selection blind assuming case nothing say lot randomness environment natural selection operates know god set randomness process understanding infinite act understanding finite mind think really work conceptually certainly true god set randomness achieve end way human understanding event leading crucifixion christ obvious example specifically identified scripture instance case event actually random relevant sense apparently random see big picture realize really random god orchestrated evolution bring human actually natural selection would situation analogous human breeding darwin called artificial selection far elaborate come breeding say natural selection blind rather actual selection occurring would apply natural selection would arguably still occurring well human-bred animal would explanation thing turned one implication would seed life another habitable planet one god orchestrating creation human being much would happen evolutionarily natural selection explain function,feser,1720,0,2386
" _My point is, more broadly speaking, that women should have at the very least the opportunity to pursue professions without it being pitted against her motherhood especially in professions which involve more intellectual endeavors rather then physical, generally speaking most professions are in that mould and even then I am not denying differences in aptitude with regards to these intellectual professions although the differences tend to be fairly neglible. What's important is the opportunity._      While I generally agree with you, I think that we need to be cautious about even this sort of limited aspiration. It's not that I think certain professions (or groups of them) _must_ be off limits to one sex or the other, it's that I think that **given the LEGITIMATE variability of wholesome cultural norms and customs** , any one culture might quite reasonably have customs that preclude some pathways that in other cultures are perfectly fine. And (being cautious about this) I don't think we are well-equipped to state categorically that a culture that is set up in such a fashion that a woman, in _practical_ terms, can either pick going into ""the professions"" or pick being full-time in child-bearer & rearing, but NOT readily do both, is thereby has bad cultural norms. Yes, in some cultures, such norms might be oppressive and wrong-headed, but not automatically in ALL cultures. For example, if a disease has wiped out many more women than men, forming a social convention that women becoming mothers of _several_ children is exactly what society most needs, the development of social pressure _towards_ that and _away_ from the professions that would demand of a woman that she have at most one or two kids would be...not obviously wrongheaded like a mere dumb prejudice that women ""aren't smart enough"" to be doctors and lawyers.      And (to bring the issue most home to roost) the _transition_ from one set of physical and economic conditions that constrain what BOTH men and women should expect in order to participate in society, to a completely different set of physical and economic conditions, would necessarily bring about a situation where the old norms, which _had been_ entirely reasonable in their context, are _becoming_ less reasonable, but (for quite some time) there would be no possible **objective** standard by which to judge the moment at which the old norms ""must"" be eradicated (by law, not by mere custom, which takes much longer) in order to procure justice. The change, itself, will be disruptive of what justice actually requires, and nobody's judgment of the matter will be definitive.   (As an aside, if motherhood, child-bearing, and child-rearing were properly valued, nobody would view being a ""mere"" housewife as a socially low-status vocation. It would, instead, be highly valued and treated as noble and worthy. And while there is every reason to affirm that fathers need to be a daily part of their children's lives, there is no principles that says well-raised children need either the same KINDS of attention, or the same AMOUNT of attention from fathers as from mothers throughout their childhood.)",point broadly speaking woman least opportunity pursue profession without pitted motherhood especially profession involve intellectual endeavor rather physical generally speaking profession mould even denying difference aptitude regard intellectual profession although difference tend fairly neglible important opportunity generally agree think need cautious even sort limited aspiration think certain profession group must limit one sex think given legitimate variability wholesome cultural norm custom one culture might quite reasonably custom preclude pathway culture perfectly fine cautious think well-equipped state categorically culture set fashion woman practical term either pick going profession pick full-time child-bearer rearing readily thereby bad cultural norm yes culture norm might oppressive wrong-headed automatically culture example disease wiped many woman men forming social convention woman becoming mother several child exactly society need development social pressure towards away profession would demand woman one two kid would benot obviously wrongheaded like mere dumb prejudice woman arent smart enough doctor lawyer bring issue home roost transition one set physical economic condition constrain men woman expect order participate society completely different set physical economic condition would necessarily bring situation old norm entirely reasonable context becoming le reasonable quite time would possible objective standard judge moment old norm must eradicated law mere custom take much longer order procure justice change disruptive justice actually requires judgment matter definitive aside motherhood child-bearing child-rearing properly valued nobody would view mere housewife socially low-status vocation would instead highly valued treated noble worthy every reason affirm father need daily part life principle say well-raised child need either kind attention amount attention father mother throughout childhood,feser,3153,0,2387

"""Another way of arriving at the conclusion that the question “why does everything exist?” is meaningless, is to consider how when we ordinarily ask “why x?” we assume the answer is something other than x. But in the case of “why anything at all?” it is not possible to find something outside of everything to explain everything.""      This is false; the question is patently meaningful - we understand what is being asked and the mystery that it is dealing with, the mystery of why things exist. It would also be uncharitable to treat as *meaningless* a question that has captivated so many of the best and most influential philosophers throughout history. ""Why is there something rather than nothing?"" isn't anywhere close to ""why do colorless green ideas sleep furiously?"". It falsely assumes that if we cannot give an answer with something other than x (to use the example) then the question has no meaning.      Edwards just begs the question by assuming that there is no answer when there IS an answer, one that has been proposed again and again by philosophers: that it is necessary for something to exist. Why is there anything at all? Because it's impossible for there not to have been anything at all. That is surely an intelligible answer.      ""why has lost its meaning because it is logically impossible to have an answer.""      It's just false that it is logically impossible to have an answer. The answer is precisely that it is logically impossible for no things to have existed. There is something rather than nothing because it's impossible for therr to have been absolutely nothing; there is something that is necessary, which could not have failed to exist, and this is why there is something. There isn't an answer beyond necessity, but that doesn't make the answer unintelligible and certainly doesn't mean we shouldn't accept it; we explain things with necessity all the time in mathematics, philosophy, etc. Plus, if one didn't accept that then they'd have to accept brute contingent things which is irrational (or at least seen as a heavy cost even for those who don't accept PSR)",another way arriving conclusion question “ why everything exist ” meaningless consider ordinarily ask “ why x ” assume answer something x case “ why anything all ” possible find something outside everything explain everything false question patently meaningful - understand asked mystery dealing mystery thing exist would also uncharitable treat meaningless question captivated many best influential philosopher throughout history something rather nothing anywhere close colorless green idea sleep furiously falsely assumes can not give answer something x use example question meaning edward begs question assuming answer answer one proposed philosopher necessary something exist anything impossible anything surely intelligible answer lost meaning logically impossible answer false logically impossible answer answer precisely logically impossible thing existed something rather nothing impossible therr absolutely nothing something necessary could failed exist something answer beyond necessity make answer unintelligible certainly mean accept explain thing necessity time mathematics philosophy etc plus one accept accept brute contingent thing irrational least seen heavy cost even accept psr,feser,2104,0,2390

"Thank you for insisting and my apologies for not having answered your question earlier. There is a concept in quantum mechanics, as well as in our everyday world, that there are observables which are commutative and others which are not. When we observe physical states that are actual, our observables are commutative. However, when we measure potential properties of a physical state, we need to take two steps: (1) put the physical state in motion so that what is potential becomes actual, and (2) measure that actuality. Some of these motions from potentiality to actuality are reversible, but some others are not (for example, if we want to measure the breakability of a chalk, we need to break it, but then we no longer have a breakable chalk, but a broken one and no way to go back to the initial state). Similarly, there are measurable variables in quantum mechanics that measure actual or reversible potential properties, which are called commutative, and others that are irreversible and typically non-commutative. In quantum physics, spins or polarizations do not commute, nor do momentum and space position. For example, if we want to measure with extreme precision the momentum of our ""two"" famous particles, measuring one and then trying to measure with precision the position of the second one, this would not be possible, and this independently of the distance between the two particles at the moment of the measurement. The proof of the validity of this prediction of quantum mechanics was done by looking at the statistics of three non-commutative spin directions showing Bell's inequalities violation, which earned Aspect the 2022 Nobel Prize",thank insisting apology answered question earlier concept quantum mechanic well everyday world observables commutative others observe physical state actual observables commutative however measure potential property physical state need take two step put physical state motion potential becomes actual measure actuality motion potentiality actuality reversible others example want measure breakability chalk need break longer breakable chalk broken one way go back initial state similarly measurable variable quantum mechanic measure actual reversible potential property called commutative others irreversible typically non-commutative quantum physic spin polarization commute momentum space position example want measure extreme precision momentum two famous particle measuring one trying measure precision position second one would possible independently distance two particle moment measurement proof validity prediction quantum mechanic done looking statistic three non-commutative spin direction showing inequality violation earned aspect nobel prize,feser,1661,0,2392

"Prof. Feser,   Interesting post, but the arguments against LNC are not convincing. If we are speaking about the ""laws of thought"", then, as I'm sure you know, the principle that anything follows from a contradiction is debatable (independently of one's stance on LNC). Many philosophers deny that one can infer anything from a contradiction.      For example, let A be the (material) conditional proposition/sentence whose antecedent is the conjunction of the ZFC axioms and whose consequent is the negation of a difficult mathematical theorem (say, Fermat's last theorem). Then, A is a contradiction (there are no models in which the ZFC axioms are true and Fermat's last theorem is false, so A is logically equivalent to a proposition of the form ""B and ~B""). But, arguably, we can't infer just anything from A. For example, the inference ""A, therefore it is raining"" does not look like a good inference. The laws of thought don't license that inference (arguably).      So, anyway, I think you're much to quick to dismiss non-classical logics as incoherent, self-undermining, etc. These are fascinating topics that deserve to be treated seriously!

So thank you, thank you so much!      @Michael, I saw the post that Ed made with an open thread and I will participate! Today was the first day in weeks that I felt a little bit better. I will try somehow engage in the arguments there, because like I said, I'm not worried about materialism per se (even though the existence of atoms and etc. sometimes puzzle me as to why God makes the world that way, you know? Why the micro exists in a way that it 'seems' that things could be ""reduced"" to them) because of the arguments Ed presented in the prolegomenon of the Scholastics Meta (I only believed materialism in this XXI century sense because I was a foolish boy born in a country that philosophy that is seriously engaging in these points marginally exists - yeah continental philosophy sucks).      My problem is the worse version of 'materialism' that is the buddhist (because in practice, doesn't matter how they argue, the consequences are basically the same but, surprisingly, worse). In these very difficult (to say the least) 3 years of my life. What really broke me from the inside (based on what I was talking about Libet) is the fact that I (and the person that I love with my life in this world, my mom, who's in fact the only family that I have in practice) could indeed be a substance per accidens (to use the best terminology) - because ALL of these ideologies like reductionism, materialism, and especially buddhism will lead to that no matter how they try to persuade or say otherwise. They will inevitably treat human beings as unreal and aggregates or 'useful fictions' (sometimes I think that it was the devil himself who plunges these ideologies into our mentality).      If there is one thing in all these 3 years that I do not forget was the pain (the mental pain and depression) that I felt and still feel. In my 24 years of life, nothing EVER hit me like that. And I don't know how people simply swallow materialism or even worse buddhism of these sorts - if they do really love their own kind ones or have any moral principles about persons at all - they should be rejecting it immediately. Because as I said what caused me all that trauma that still scares me today is the possibility of those things (i.e the fact that we are just an aggregate or unreal and live just to suffer). It's simply devilish. Why would anyone want to live in a world like that? You know.",hey talmid michael guy thank much word really mean lot usually alone friend people say thing like guy said really mean lot - know lack really warms heart people care u thank thank much michael saw post ed made open thread participate today first day week felt little bit better try somehow engage argument like said worried materialism per se even though existence atom etc sometimes puzzle god make world way know micro exists way seems thing could reduced argument ed presented prolegomenon scholastic meta believed materialism xxi century sense foolish boy born country philosophy seriously engaging point marginally exists - yeah continental philosophy suck problem worse version materialism buddhist practice matter argue consequence basically surprisingly worse difficult say least year life really broke inside based talking libet fact person love life world mom fact family practice could indeed substance per accidens use best terminology - ideology like reductionism materialism especially buddhism lead matter try persuade say otherwise inevitably treat human being unreal aggregate useful sometimes think devil plunge ideology mentality one thing year forget pain mental pain depression felt still feel year life nothing ever hit like know people simply swallow materialism even worse buddhism sort - really love kind one moral principle person - rejecting immediately said caused trauma still scare today possibility thing ie fact aggregate unreal live suffer simply devilish would anyone want live world like know,feser,2703,0,2408
"Thanks Professor for your work. I can’t begin to describe how much I have learned from you and how you have help develop a deeper understanding and conception of God in my life.      In the Last Superstition, you outlined five levels of conception of God that a theist can have. Each of the of levels reducing its anthropomorphic limitations. I think level 2 and level 3 are juxtaposed in this post: theistic personalism a level 2 and classical theism a level 3. William Lane Craig has expressed his level 2 conception in this manner: you can use scientific information in a philosophical argument to make theological conclusions. Where you have said that theological philosophy or natural theology should be grounded in the philosophy of nature not the natural sciences. Although I like your leaf analogy in showing that level 2 partial explanation would be deficient, I was wondering wouldn’t a level 4 (unitive experience) and level 5 (beatific vision) conception render a level 3 conception deficient as well, consequently undermining a classical theistic approach? Shouldn’t we just see each conception on a pathway to a mature and fuller understanding of God? Or would you argue that a level 2 conception of God, despite some ostensible apologetic utility, does more damage than good, in a way that a level 3 conception does not when compared to a level 4 and 5? And if so how so?

"I'm not sure that the creaturely changes are necessarily ""destroying"" (or creating) parts of God (beliefs) on the open theists' assumption. I think they are determining them. I will assume open theists who believe God is maximally knowledgeable, that is, knows all that can be known, which does not include perfect knowledge of the future according to them.      On this set of assumptions God will still, however, have perfect foreknowledge of all possible outcomes as he can understand all possible cause/effect branches as First Cause. He just doesn't know which path along the branching options will eventuate before the time that they do. This means his knowledge grows only in the sense that he is able to pick out which of each fully foreseen branch is actualised. In other words, the only way his knowledge grows is by the steady lengthening of a ""track"" through a foreknown ""space"" of possible world-states over time. In such a scenario, creatures with free will would determine the direction of the track and thus the precise determination of God’s knowledge of it, but they would not be adding to or subtracting from God's beliefs in any quantitative sense. The addition that would occur comes about automatically as time flows, no matter what finite agents decide.      Please note, I do not hold this position, but it seems to me it is not guilty of the exact absurdity alleged here, whatever its other flaws.

"@ Norm,      About Elon Musk, I said ""he doesn't spoil his act with prolonged ax grinding against an innocent target"". See that word ""prolonged"" in there? That was inserted with care. In other words I did not claim that he does not go after the innocent as well as the guilty. It is the hammering away at the same person that changes it from humor to something else.      ""I feel it's a bit uncharitable to lay all of the blame at the feet of Pope Francis""      Who has done that? Meanwhile, Francis is the pope now, so his actions will naturally get the most attention.      I have not been criticizing Pope Francis, but ""Amoris Laetitia"" (which you mention), the Pope's communication, has prompted many criticisms of the lack of guidance from the Pope, and if these criticisms were not well founded, the plain, simply spoken guidance becomes all the more important. That people feel the absence of this is a problem. The suffering of people who feel, rightly or wrongly, that the Church is going off the rails needs urgent attention, not ""official"" statements or abstruse theology from people no one has heard of. It needs careful shepherding by the person who issued the letter - the Pope.      That its absence is no excuse for loss or destabilization of faith really says nothing. No one has excuses for their sins, and yet everyone faces attacks caused by imperfect trust in God precisely because we are human, and that is why loving pastoral guidance is needed. ""Let God sort them out, I know why their fears are unjust"" is insufficient. The absence of this guidance is fair game for criticism. The respectful waiting that you advise justifiably grows into real criticism with time. It is in a sense an abandonment of the straying sheep who need to be brought back into the fold.      ""Also if I feel that something should be expressed in a particular way, why can't I suggest it, whether it's taken or not is irrelevant and doesn't change my admiration and respect for Prof.""      I am happy that you admire and respect Ed, but it has not sounded like it.

"(Continuation)      So not just it's unfair and wrong to say that ""this usage is common to Aristotle"" but one thing that I noticed in the book of both authors is the somewhat intentional sidestep or ""shell game"" of problems - like they were trying intentionally guide the book in a way to evade potential questions to their points. To be fair, Siderits tried to address some points of that (I do recommend the reading of the Chapter 4 since the most relevant discussion of points that could be related to our philosophy concentrates there). But his position simply gives me the impression that he tries to misplace the substance into its parts (like a shell game) and then comes to the conclusion that the substance could not exist. In responding to how accidents are always found in the substances (he does not use the term accidents, I'm using it to simplify) if they do not exist, he says:      ""Consider the water atom as an allegedly indivisible substance in which inhere the qualities of color, shape, wetness and mass. Resistance to the notion that these qualities may be thought of as its parts comes from the intuition that qualities do not simply float freely in the air, that they must be tethered to something that then explains their occurrence together with other qualities. Bundle theorists are typically asked to provide the principle of qualitative unity that would explain the co- occurrence of many qualities in the absence of a substance in which they inhere. The Buddhist bundle theorist says this is the wrong question to be asking. Instead we should ask why, in the absence of empirical evidence for the existence of substances as distinct from their properties, we nonetheless have the intuition that substances are required to explain qualitative unity."" (pp. 59)      To say that ""in the absence of empirical evidence"" is just to beg the question. but he goes on to say:      ""By hypothesis, color, shape, wetness, and mass tropes are compresent at a certain spatio- temporal location. This much both sides can agree on. Here is a possible explanation of the fact that we commonly take these to all be properties of a single thing, the water atom. When we wish to specify the location of this mass trope, it is easier to indicate it by using the term “water atom” than by indicating each of the three other tropes present at that location. This makes the communication process more efficient. It also relieves us of the burden of ascertaining just which other tropes are present at that location, given that we know from past experience that mass tropes are generally accompanied by other tropes in a certain range. “Water atom” functions as a convenient designator for a certain bundle of tropes (TS 832– 34; TSP ad TS 581– 83). That they make up a bundle has as much to do with us and our interests and cognitive limitations as it does with how things are in the   world. The world as it is anyway contributes the fact of their compresence. The rest— their being unified by their joint inherence in a substance— is our doing. The Buddhist doctrine of the two truths is their answer to the bundle theorist’s problem of unification.""      Basically, he uses their conventionalist position to ""explain"" how we construe substances from things that are nothing but tropes.

"Unfortunately, there is no Kindle version for this book, and I will have to wait it to be delivered with Amazon in Switzerland, hence my comments will be comments on (Feser’s) comment which is not the summit of the state of the art to discuss about this topic.   I think it is rather ingenuous to wish to establish hylomorphism as the right paradigm to interpret quantum mechanic without doing the effort to analyze the logical structures that support the Aristotelian, the Newtonian, and the Quantum mechanical world.   There has been a deep void in understanding the World from Illuminism to nowadays: (1) the deep misunderstanding of the nature of space and time on side, which became like a “box” where all bodies are contained, and which paradigm impedes very clever people to understand the meaning of physics at a reality layer; (2) the consequential shrinking of the Aristotelian/Thomistic logic into a poor subset, namely the Boolean logic, by avoiding to take into account the reality of the existence of things (medium term typically) to validate a reasoning; (3) the objective lack of understanding of what a form is, letting platonic idealism invade the field of scientific reflection (typical of the Descartes pretention to find the soul, which is the form of the human body, inside the pineal gland).   Hence there is no wonder that people do not actually understand that general and local theories of relativity are not the physics of a space-time universal box (i.e., how could the universe be a big block of space and time, while neutrinos and photons, in their own reference’s frame exist for zero second in an infinite space, while for each of us all what we experience and even think is in our physical past, etc. etc.); the symmetries that we find (which are actually the expression of the law of physics) are never perfectly realized in the nature (e.g., time cannot be reversed); or when reflecting on quantum mechanics the paradigmatic incapacity to understand that the form of a system, included its potentiality, is not an element of space and time and that it is impossible to decorrelate a potentiality from the objective possible ends of the considered quantum system.   The Newtonian world is an impoverished world which thinks essentially in terms of BArbArA, while science proceeds falsifying reasoning like BOcArdO, and while everyday people actually uses essentially a DArII logical structure, and Quantum Mechanic the similar DArAptI.   What defines univocally a form is the final cause of it, which is typical of the Quantum Approach of measurement: in contrast, reductionism, which is fine for engineering purposes, cannot pretend to define, per construction, the final cause, even though it allows to understand “the how” this last one is made ""reachable"", it cannot trigger per se that one.   The final cause is, at the end, what gives form to the form included the Quantum form within a world which is driven by Aristotelian logic and, all of that, without paradoxes.

Our brains were formed in a material universe out of material and, from birth, we observe a non-contradictory environment (""no one has ever seen a non-chair-chair""), so it's hardly a surprise non-contradiction is a basis of right thinking, or a pillar of logic. There is no need to import an outside, non-material ""it"" to explain our need for non-contradiction in thought. You are right, Walter does not have a law of non-contradiction (or laws of logic) buried in his basement. He doesn't have to dig for it. It's buried in his very being. Principles do not effect being; being effects principles. You are confusing cause and effect.      Even if I accepted your argument, it still does not follow that an eternal mind is the cause.

"Son of Ya'Kov, I think I've said it before, but here it is again: it seems a great mistake to call anthropomorphic theism ""theistic personalism"", which, as described around the blog, does not consist in personalism at all, but in the type of personalism, in this case, anthropomorphic.      As personalism, like goodness and simplicity, are supremely divine characteristics, but exist analogically in humans, why single it out? The problem is surely anthropomorphism! Since the Renaissance/Enlightenment, the dominant error has been to reduce God to an impersonal force of nature, not make Him a human person (when that is done, in the person of Christ, we still revert to God as ""cosmos"" etc. anyway - impersonal).      It's true that Catholics should counter any error that postulates (sincerely or not) an anthropomorphic God as ""straw man"". But we have to remember that the straw man is an excuse, not a religion competing with the Church. Atheists don't ""believe"" in an anthropomorphic God, even if some of them want us to. If you mean Protestants and Evangelicals etc., they can easily be handled as always. They aren't going to collapse in heap even if we spend the next five hundred years shouting at them that God is not a person like them. Among the errors assailing Catholics today, attacks on divine simplicity are not the most common or effective. Naturalism, and anything that tends to depersonalise God, abounds.

"WCB,      It's an uncontroversial, well-acknowledged fact of intellectual history that ""critical theory"" is a tradition of thought that emerged out of Marxism and was pioneered by self-avowed Marxists. What else could CRT be invoking with ""Critical"" in the very name but that tradition?      From the Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's page on ""Critical Theory"":      ""According to these theorists, a 'critical' theory may be distinguished from a 'traditional' theory according to a specific practical purpose: a theory is critical to the extent that it seeks human 'emancipation from slavery', acts as a 'liberating … influence', and works 'to create a world which satisfies the needs and powers of' human beings (Horkheimer 1972b [1992, 246]). Because such theories aim to explain and transform all the circumstances that enslave human beings, many 'critical theories in the broader sense have been developed. They have emerged in connection with the many social movements that identify varied dimensions of the domination of human beings in modern societies.      ...While Critical Theory is often thought of narrowly as referring to the Frankfurt School that begins with Horkheimer and Adorno and stretches to Marcuse and Habermas, any philosophical approach with similar practical aims could be called a 'critical theory,' including feminism, critical race theory, and some forms of post-colonial criticism.""

"(Continuing...)      At this point, you must be asking ""why all that focus on Ed's work? are you just some kind of bizarre worshiper (or, like we say here in Brazil, a 'puxa- saco')?"" And the answer is no! I just say a lot of his work in general because he is the kind of person that says what needs to be said. He goes straight to the point, he's incisive (in the good sense, of course) about his ideas. He will say firmly why an idea does not follow at all and make it clear about it (he will say the reasons why it does not follow and so on). In short, it's the kind of work that you will not find gaps in (and if you read pop philosophers and even other professional philosophers, you can clearly see how Ed is careful in his statements and analysis and do not fall prey to fallacies or misrepresent other positions).

I stated that people should stop arguing about it and respect the American people's decision because it was their country, their decision and it was not of our business to criticize them. Sometime later my post had unexpected attention and a generalized discussion in the comments with ad hominem and everything you could imagine (and my post was just literally something inoffensive and simple as that! Without any direct or indirect offense) so I definitely decided to stay away from all of that cringe situation and shut it down (I don't miss it at all).

"‘It is very common, doubtless, especially in religious controversy, to confuse infallibility with certitude, and to argue that, since we have not the one, we have not the other, for that no one can claim to be certain on any point, who is not infallible about all; but the two words stand for things quite distinct from each other. For example, I remember for certain what I did yesterday, but still my memory is not infallible; I am quite clear that two and two makes four, but I often make mistakes in long addition sums. I have no doubt whatever that John or Richard is my true friend, but I have before now trusted those who failed me, and I may do so again before I die.’      ‘A certitude is directed to this or that particular proposition; it is not a faculty or gift, but a disposition of mind relatively to a definite case which is before me. Infallibility, on the contrary, is just that which certitude is not; it is a faculty or gift, and relates, not to some one truth in particular, but to all possible propositions in a given subject-matter. We ought in strict propriety, to speak, not of infallible acts, but of acts of infallibility…’      ‘A man is infallible, whose words are always true; a rule is infallible, if it is unerring in all its possible applications. An infallible authority is certain in every particular case that may arise; but a man who is certain in some one definite case, is not on that account infallible.’      ‘I am quite certain that Victoria is our Sovereign, and not her father, the late Duke of Kent, without laying any claim to the gift of infallibility; as I may do a virtuous action, without being impeccable. I may be certain that the Church is infallible, while I am myself a fallible mortal; otherwise, I cannot be certain that the Supreme Being is infallible, until I am infallible myself. It is a strange objection, then, which is sometimes urged against Catholics, that they cannot prove and assent to the Church's infallibility, unless they first believe in their own. Certitude, as I have said, is directed to one or other definite concrete proposition. I am certain of proposition one, two, three, four, or five, one by one, each by itself. I may be certain of one of them, without being certain of the rest; that I am certain of the first makes it neither likely nor unlikely that I am certain of the second; but were I infallible, then I should be certain, not only of one of them, but of all, and of many more besides, which have never come before me as yet. Therefore we may be certain of the infallibility of the Church, while we admit that in many things we are not, and cannot be, certain at all.’      St John Henry Newman, ‘A Grammar of Assent’ pp. 173-74  ",‘ it common doubtless especially religious controversy confuse infallibility certitude argue since one one claim certain point infallible two word stand thing quite distinct example remember certain yesterday still memory infallible quite clear two two make four often make mistake long addition sum doubt whatever john richard true friend trusted failed may die ‘ a certitude directed particular proposition faculty gift disposition mind relatively definite case infallibility contrary certitude faculty gift relates one truth particular possible proposition given subject-matter ought strict propriety speak infallible act act infallibility… ‘ a man infallible whose word always true rule infallible unerring possible application infallible authority certain every particular case may arise man certain one definite case account infallible ‘ i quite certain victoria sovereign father late duke kent without laying claim gift infallibility may virtuous action without impeccable may certain church infallible fallible mortal otherwise can not certain supreme infallible infallible strange objection sometimes urged catholic can not prove assent infallibility unless first believe certitude said directed one definite concrete proposition certain proposition one two three four five one one may certain one without certain rest certain first make neither likely unlikely certain second infallible certain one many besides never come yet therefore may certain infallibility church admit many thing can not certain st john henry newman ‘ a grammar pp -,feser,2722,0,2425
"That includes claims to the effect that quantum mechanics has refuted the laws of thought. It has done no such thing. There is nothing in either quantum phenomena or quantum theory that entails that. Rather, what has happened is that some people have proposed _interpreting_ quantum phenomena and quantum theory in a way that gives up one or more of the laws of thought. That’s all. And even then, the interpretation is not a purely “scientific” interpretation of quantum mechanics, because _none_ of the competing interpretations in category (3) is purely scientific.

"Now, with Newton, Chomsky notes, modern physics abandoned a strictly mechanical model. What he means is that the early mechanists thought that the simple push-pull kind of causation that one sees in watches and the like could provide a model for how the physical world in general works, but Newton posited forces that did not operate in this way, and indeed the operation of which he did not explain or claim to explain at all.

There's some food for thought.      Yet another person above noted that you are presupposing determinism and then also pretending like it is the conclusion of an argument. Everyone here sees this clearly and you wish for us to believe that you are the only person, not just here, but in all of theological history with 20/20 vision on this question? That suggestion authentically moves beyond laughable to worthy of pity.      The reason you are parading your initial premise as the conclusion to an argument is because you are not competent in either theology or the rudiments of logic.

"Continued from my previous post:      Hi Eric,      Please see my previous post first. Below are some quotes about Christians’ view of possessions from the first few centuries. (BTW these are not about Communism, in case anyone is saying that the early Christians were Communists. The early Christians were not telling the wider society to sell possessions or share properties/goods).      “SHARE EVERYTHING with your brother. Do not say, ‘It is PRIVATE PROPERTY.’ If you share what is everlasting, you should be that much more willing to share things which do not last.” – The Didache, c. 100AD      “PRIVATE PROPERTY is the fruit of iniquity. I know that God has given us the use of goods, but only as far as is necessary; and he has determined that the use shall be COMMON. The use of all things that are found in this world ought to be common to all men. Only the most manifest iniquity makes one say to another, ‘This belongs to me, that to you.’ Hence the origin of contention among men.” - Clement of Alexandria, 150-215 AD      “We who once took most pleasure in the means of increasing our wealth and property now bring what we have into a COMMON FUND and share with everyone in need.” – Justin Martyr, c.150 AD      “They [the Christians] take his [Jesus’] instructions completely on faith, with the result that they despise all worldly goods and hold them in COMMON OWNERSHIP.” - Lucian (non-Christian), in his writing against Christianity, c.170AD      “We who share one mind and soul obviously have no misgivings about COMMUNITY OF GOODS.” – Tertullian, 160-225 AD      “That expression, therefore, “I possess, and possess in abundance: why then should I not enjoy?” is suitable neither to the man, nor to society... He [God] has determined that the use [of all things] should be common. And it is monstrous for one to live in luxury, while many are in want.” - Clement of Alexandria, 150-215 AD      “And all the believers were together and had ALL THINGS IN COMMON; and they would sell their property and possessions and share them with all, to the extent that anyone had need.” - Acts 2.44-45      “And the congregation of those who believed were of one heart and soul; and not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own, but ALL THINGS WERE COMMON PROPERTY to them. And with great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was upon them all. For there was not a needy person among them, for all who were owners of land or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds of the sales and lay them at the apostles’ feet, and they would be distributed to each to the extent that any had need. Now Joseph, a Levite of Cyprian birth, who was also called Barnabas by the apostles (which translated means Son of Encouragement), owned a tract of land. So he sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.” - Acts 4:32-37      So the above teachings of various early Christian’s tilted the balance of probability to one side. It seems more likely than not that Jesus intended his followers to forgo storing up treasures on earth but instead to store up treasures in heaven through selling possessions to help the needy.      Like other human beings, I am fallible and thus I am open to correction.

"Mr. Jindra,      You are spot on that the materialist had not thought through his position, but you are mistaken in thinking that you have thought through yours. Dr. Yogami offers you some help above, some of which I am going to reiterate by explaining the difference between a debate and a lecture.      At a debate you consider whether a particular proposition is true or false. A debate such as the one noted above would normally be in a form such as: whether or not materialism is true. That would be the proposition under consideration and one person would take the affirmative side (i.e. Yes, it is true) and another would take the negative side (i.e. no it is not true).      In such a debate, it is important that the terms are defined. Otherwise, equivocation can occur and the debaters will talk past one another. So, it would be important to clarify that materialism is the assertion that matter is all that there is. Once that is established and the questions are established, folks then make arguments for their positions. That is the way a debate works.      Now what you describe is a situation where you refuse to participate in the debate and stand with your hands crossed. Well, that is not a debate. That is a lecture wherein, in this instance, you sit and listen to Dr. William Lane Craig and learn from him. Now that would be very good for you, but the point is that such a situation is not a debate.      In fact, it would be very awkward for you to stand in front of a crowd with a podium next to Dr. Craig and just gawk at him. You are going to have to say or do something. Now if you say something, you are doing to have to either: a. utter complete non-sense (perhaps you might simply repeat the letter Q over and over again), or b. make an argument for your case. Either way you end up looking like bafoon who cannot offer the slightest support for your position without showing your behind (here you and Walter and Dr. Craig's opponent have something in common).      Now, there is an alternative. Rather than saying something, you could do something. For example, you could do interpretive dance while Dr. Craig makes his arguments. You could do ballet and offer a rendition of the nutcracker. Or you might simply do the macarena. All viable options.      Or, perhaps, you might sit in the audience and learn from Dr. Craig. This last option seems to me the wisest alternative. But, then, we would not have a debate now would we?

"""Anyway, even if we take the view that there would be no Incarnation if there was no Fall it is true that God decision of sending His Son happened before the Fall, for He is outside time(,as St. Augustine argued) and so there is not in God something like thinking at time t1 and them choosing at time t2. The same eternal decision of having the Fall got at the same time the aincarnation decision.""      I don't think I agree with that. I would say God can choose at t2 something that he would not have chosen at t1, if, for instance, something happened at t2 which had not happened before it. For instance, if you just decided to go pray at t2, but not at t1, God might then have decided at t2 to make himself present to you or whatever, in response to what you chose to do at t2.   But of course, I reject foreknowledge, so there's that.      But even under foreknowledge it is still plausible that God's choices are taken in different logical moments (even if not at different temporal moments), we might say. Because we want to say (if we believe in free will) that God chooses to do things in response to our choices. So these particular choices of God will at least be dependent on our making of the choices (maybe, if you believe in foreknowledge, God chose everything he would do at the very same temporal moment he created the world, but there must have been some logical priority to his choice of creating the world, since your choices - and therefore God's responses to your choices - are dependent upon that world being made).      Of course, none of that (not even my own view) needs to entail that God is temporal. My view of time is the classical Aristotelian one as the ""measure of change"", not the confused modern one. God choosing what to do at t2 (and not at t1) doesn't entail that God is temporal unless it also entails that God undergoes a change of intrinsic properties when he makes the choice, which classical theists should deny. If it implies God is ""temporal"", it is only in a way that would be perfectly open to classical theists (since it wouldn't imply God is changing).",anyway even take view would incarnation fall true god decision sending son happened fall outside timeas st augustine argued god something like thinking time choosing time eternal decision fall got time aincarnation decision think agree would say god choose something would chosen instance something happened happened instance decided go pray god might decided make present whatever response chose course reject foreknowledge even foreknowledge still plausible choice taken different logical moment even different temporal moment might say want say believe free god chooses thing response choice particular choice god least dependent making choice maybe believe foreknowledge god chose everything would temporal moment created world must logical priority choice creating world since choice - therefore response choice - dependent upon world made course none even view need entail god temporal view time classical aristotelian one measure change confused modern one god choosing entail god temporal unless also entail god undergoes change intrinsic property make choice classical theist deny implies god temporal way would perfectly open classical theist since imply god changing,feser,2101,0,2446

"I don't think gender dysphoria is as crazy or as incoherent as a concept as natural law theorists believe. In fact, the ""gender"" part of the name is a clue to what's going on.      Gender is not a biological concept, but a grammatical one. In Indo-European and Semitic languages (and a few others), all nouns have a gender: male or female, or occasionally male, female, and neuter. How nouns get assigned gender is mysterious, although it is generally speaking correlated with the shape of the noun's declension/ending.      Now, when you study personality types in fiction, you learn that certain types are more ""naturally"" written as male characters, or vice versa. So it can be said that personality types are gendered just like nouns. But because characters in fiction are never neuter (and even neuter characters take on a preferred gender), it follows that personality types only come in male or female, just like Genesis says: ""male and female created He them."" (Genesis 1:27)      What I think is happening with people with gender dysphoria is that as they're developing their personality type, they realize that their type is a different gender than their biological sex. There's nothing that says God is obligated to assign you a personality type that aligns with your gender, because God doesn't practice physiognomy. So this seems like a logical explanation that explains all the data.",think gender dysphoria crazy incoherent concept natural law theorist believe fact gender part name clue going gender biological concept grammatical one indo-european semitic language others noun gender male female occasionally male female neuter noun get assigned gender mysterious although generally speaking correlated shape declensionending study personality type fiction learn certain type naturally written male character vice versa said personality type gendered like noun character fiction never neuter even neuter character take preferred gender follows personality type come male female like genesis say male female created genesis think happening people gender dysphoria developing personality type realize type different gender biological sex nothing say god obligated assign personality type aligns gender god practice physiognomy seems like logical explanation explains data,feser,1397,0,2450

"Johannes ---      Luke 12:33. This is, as I understand the passage, governed by the context established in v. 22, where it says ""Then Jesus said to his disciples"", which either means the twelve or perhaps a slightly larger group. This does not appear to be a general-for-all-people-for-all-time principle, but rather the idea of complete dependence on God for future missionary and apostolic work by this small group of the earliest believers.      14:33 --- again, the context indicates a degree of hyperbole. A few verses earlier, J says nobody who does not hate father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, and their own lives can be his disciple. Doesn't that strike you as hyperbole? Doesn't it strike you that the giving up of ""everything"" is also part of this hyperbole? Or, following WCB's sub-literate village atheist schtick, we can say that the Bible teaches us to hate our parents.      The general principle is to not be that attached to one's worldly goods, wealth, status, etc, for these things are transitory. All wealth and blessings are ultimately from God, and (as a pastor once told me), you and I will only have our wealth until God doesn't want us to have it anymore. There is also the general principle that too much material blessing can be a great stumbling block.      Even though I think the context decisively undercuts any attempt to generalize those passages, let's say you disagree. In this case, another test is this: what happens if every Christian did in fact what the passages suggest. Now we have no possessions, no money, and are complete wards of the (nonchristian) state.

"God can have all the necessary reasons to create in every possible world. And he knows these reasons by knowing himself.      If your problem is that you think these reasons have to be literal, existing separate things in the divine mind (and they cannot be identified with each other) then the problem isn't with divine creative freedom per se, but rather with the status of the multiplicity of divine ideas (""and 2 must be different from 5!""). That is a different problem. Speaking for myself it's not clear to me that divine ideas must literally exist as separate entities; the nature of knowledge and how (it seems to me) it's basically a ""transparent"" power whereby something is grasped by the knower and understood through itself seems to me compatible with God knowing different abstract facts by means of a single known concrete substance which is analyzed (a substance that happens to be the ground of all possibilia anyway, God), though I cannot hope to imagine it. I think what Dolezal has written on the divine ideas would also be very helpful here.      Thus God's personhood is grounded in impersonal notions like ""being"" and ""act"": for Thomists, these are what God is, primarily""      This misses the point. The point at that stage is precisely that ""being"" and ""act"" are NOT impersonal. Intelligence is an irreducible aspect of existence which some beings (like us) enjoy when they're not limited enough. God's personhood is not grounded in anything impersonal (that would be absurd); existence in its fullness is taken to be irreducibly personal. It's impersonal beings that just happen to be limited enough that they are unable to possess that dimension of being, so to speak. As the ultimate source of personhood and the unlimited actuality of the principle that is the basis of personhood, God is personal through and through.

"@Walter      ""The main point is whether we could call a being who wants a world of suffering ""good.""      Well, we can't. I do call Him Goodness Itself and other cool names, though.      A essencial part of this christian theodicy* is that God has a relation with morality totally diferent than our own, see for instance the fact that He can judge people, can kill people, can pester people until they want to do His thing(see Jonah) etc. The Book of Job lets this clear when God finally appears, for Job is trying to tread God as a equal the whole time, who needs to explain His actions to him and all that, and when He finally appears He makes very clear that Job treatment of Him as how we would do a normal person is completely ridiculous.      So the idea that God is good yes but on a more analogical than univocal way is not a clever apologetical invention but is there on the religions of the book since the beginning. It just sounds bizarre to me to see someone argue otherwise, specially when the ""the names Scripture uses to talk of God should not be understood as exactly what they mean in us"" is a thing since the church fathers.      This is important, for if God goodness is not exactly our own them His priorities can be diferent.

"I agree in general with Prof Feser's critique in the talk.But I don't really understand his position on women working or being a part of the work force. It seems to me at times that his position entails that women ought to have no career ambitions if they decide to have children or at the very least they shouldn't seek to compete with man in the professional space even if they do want to enter the workforce and at the same time have children. On another occasion, Prof Feser has indicated that, if having kids does indeed interfere with a women's professional ambition, this is not something we have to rectify because the professional life is not their vocation in the first place per se.This seems like a bit of an overreach to me, I think women should be afforded the option of pursuing both their career as well their family ambitions in harmony with each other.And society can work towards creating the conditions for that reality. Obviously one's career ambitions shouldn't lead to neglect of one's children. That is always wrong. And it is wrong to scorn at momss who give up their career to take care of their children.Obviously kids take precedence in situations where one's career and family ambitions seem to clash. However this is just as true of men as it is of women. Men also have to be present in their children's life. In fact the model of the man continuously being away from the kids for career related reasons or the work 10 hours a day model and come home only when the kids are asleep routine, thereby leading to kids hardly ever seeing their dad is precisely what has lead to the crisis of fatherhood. If you reduce the man's role to nothing but breadwinning ,then it becomes hard to see why two women couldn't get the job done just as well.   The answer is that men play a very integral role in the child's development, they are the ones who are responsible for and are more involved in fostering the child's competitive spirit and risk taking which are very important for flourishing in life. And they are generally speaking better in this respect then women which was illustrated by famed Rutger's University psychologist David Popnoe.I think a comedy sketch by a female comedian inadvertently illustrated this perfectly. Men tend to get very involved in competitive endeavours even when they aren't competing and this is all the more true for their own kin.      https://youtube.com/shorts/tWdB-LiP93w?feature=share      So the idea that men get a pass on their childs development isn't right in anyway and if the idea of career getting in the way of family is wrong for women, it's just as wrong for men.

"A reasonable optimism says that in most cases most people’s consciences are correct. Thus typically we would expect that most violators of a legitimate law will not be acting out of conscience—for a necessarily condition for the legitimacy of a law is that it does not conflict with a correct conscience. Thus, even if there is the rare murderer acting from mistaken conscience, most murderers act against conscience, and by incentivizing abstention from murder, in most cases the law _helps_ people follow their conscience, and the small number of other cases can be tolerated as a side effect. Thus the considerations of conscience favor intolerant laws in such cases. Nonetheless, there are cases where most violators of a law would likely be acting from conscience. Thus, if we had a law requiring eating meat, we would expect that most of the violators would be conscientious. Similarly, a law against something—say, the wearing of certain clothes or symbols—that is rarely done except as a religious practice would likely be a law most violators of which would be conscientious.",reasonable optimism say case conscience correct thus typically would expect violator legitimate law acting conscience—for necessarily condition legitimacy law conflict correct conscience thus even rare murderer acting mistaken conscience murderer act conscience incentivizing abstention murder case law help people follow conscience small number case tolerated side effect thus consideration conscience favor intolerant law case nonetheless case violator law would likely acting conscience thus law requiring eating meat would expect violator would conscientious similarly law something—say wearing certain clothes symbols—that rarely done except religious practice would likely law violator would conscientious,pruss,1084,1,2486

"I've wondered about such incompossible goods myself. Weightlifting can reduce agility, for example, and while being tall is great for basketball, it is not good for weightlifting. Various niches seem to exist. It does raise the question of what a perfect human being consists of, however. Are some of these ""perfections"" merely accidental in the sense that they exploit what are normatively speaking (in relation to human nature) flaws? We know some sports are actually bad for the human body, or neglect the overall health of the body. Certain perfections seem to be perfections only in an analogical sense, perhaps something along the lines of being a ""good thief"" or an ""effective deceiver"".      Where intelligence is concerned, I am tempted to argue against incompossible goods either because intelligence isn't like that or for similar natural law reasons, but even more strongly, especially on account of the centrality of intelligence to humanity.      Consider your favorite déformation professionnelle, which, I submit, is more of a result of imprudence, habit, ignorance, lack of practice using other methods, and even effeminacy and arrogance. Someone with a rigorous philosophical education is less likely to try to pigeonhole reality into the reductive and simplified straitjacket of our physical models in the manner of at least some physicists who generally lack serious exposure to philosophy and may even hold it in contempt out of ignorance. A physicist may also be tempted to pigeonhole simply because of pride; if he isn't any good at metaphysics, then his thoughts on a metaphysical subject matter aren't likely to be very valuable or interesting, and that stings the prideful man accustomed to feeling like a hotshot. There is also the threat of seeing one's own field put in its methodological place, so to speak, deflating any pretensions to the kind of ultimacy that metaphysics lays claim to. A competent physics may also derive greater pleasure from exercising his specialized competence and choose his methods simply on the basis of what feels good and now what is called for by a problem. So here the question resurfaces: is there an incompossibility between being a good physicist and a good metaphysician? I suspect there isn't intrinsically, even if that is often the case which I suspect is rather a result of how one's time is spent. But even if it is the case, because general knowledge is superior and more worthy of human attention than specialized knowledge, we could argue that competence in physics that occurs at the expense of philosophical depth is, in fact, a kind of failure to attain human excellence by failing to devote proportional attention and effort to the kinds of knowledge that are most essential, and in doing so, risking intellectual deformation in important and even necessary matters.",ive wondered incompossible good weightlifting reduce agility example tall great basketball good weightlifting various niche seem exist raise question perfect human consists however perfection merely accidental sense exploit normatively speaking relation human nature flaw know sport actually bad human body neglect overall health body certain perfection seem perfection analogical sense perhaps something along line good thief effective deceiver intelligence concerned tempted argue incompossible good either intelligence like similar natural law reason even strongly especially account centrality intelligence humanity consider favorite déformation professionnelle submit result imprudence habit ignorance lack practice using method even effeminacy arrogance someone rigorous philosophical education le likely try pigeonhole reality reductive simplified straitjacket physical model manner least physicist generally lack serious exposure philosophy may even hold contempt ignorance physicist may also tempted pigeonhole simply pride good metaphysics thought metaphysical subject matter likely valuable interesting sting prideful man accustomed feeling like hotshot also threat seeing field put methodological place speak deflating pretension kind ultimacy metaphysics lay claim competent physic may also derive greater pleasure exercising specialized competence choose method simply basis feel good called problem question resurfaces incompossibility good physicist good metaphysician suspect intrinsically even often case suspect rather result time spent even case general knowledge superior worthy human attention specialized knowledge could argue competence physic occurs expense philosophical depth fact kind failure attain human excellence failing devote proportional attention effort kind knowledge essential risking intellectual deformation important even necessary matter,pruss,2844,1,2490

"Well done. You, and I believe someone else, touch on another point I wanted to make but already had a four part reply. :) As you say, there had not yet at the time of Honorious been a formal declaration against monotheletism, so one could not be accused of knowingly opposing a formally established doctrine of the faith. At most, one could say he erred in failing to make an allegedly obvious deduction from Chalcedon (all arguable), but that it seems to me would still just rise to the level of material heresy, because presumably the failure to make such a deduction would not in itself evidence obstinancy in error. And, to be a formal error, there would have to be, I think, a formal declaration of what is to be believed. So I think we are back to (among other things) the question of whether it even makes sense to accuse a deceased person of formal heresy (which Feser has not done I realize), unless perhaps we can explicitly find a place where this person acknowledged he knew his view was heretical and did not care, etc.      It is also fair to say, I think, that these current insights would prevent such declarations against Honorius today. And we might have raise, as i have previously, where future popes could amend the non doctrinal juridical condemnations of earlier councils, but I would have to know more about the status of such statement relative to the establishment of tradition to venture a confident answer on that point. But I am inclined, very tentatively, to say since judgments are not infallible (even if they are at least authoritative AT THE TIME they are given) that they could be corrected later--though of course those corrections themselves could also be the same measure also be reviewed later, and so on.

I'll go for this: those microorganismos were substances at first ( _per se subsistens_ ), capable of ""independent"" life and then merged. A new organism (substantial form) emerged (new species). The mitochondria would remain there virtually, until through accidental changes it could no longer re-gain (in a natural manner) its independence, becoming an obligate intracellular organelle.

"The scientific description of light as an appearance characterized by both particles and waves is further explained and unified if light is understood and observed to be always in a spiral or helix form - like the material form of DNA, which is, itself, a direct materialization of the structure of light.   If a spiral-form is seen at its point of rotation, or its crossover point, it is observable as a ""particle"". And if the same spiral-form is seen with reference to its limbs of rotation, before or after its point of rotation, or its crossover point, it is observable as a ""wave"".   So, also, light is observable as both ""particle"" or ""wave"", depending on which phase of its process is observed by attention, or point of view in time and space.   A vibrating string can be seen to demonstrate the same spiraliform gait as any mode of observable light. And, so, as a kind of poetic inspiration, modern scientists have produced numerous string theories, in their search for the presumed knowledge that will supposedly explain everything.   Nevertheless, whether light is observed and, thus understood as a ""particle"" or a ""wave"" or as a string, that observation or understanding is, itself an act of perspectival objectification, wherein and whereby Reality Itself is reduced, by the very act of observation, or understanding or mental fabrication, to a relation and, thus, a subordinate of attention, or point of view of the presumed separate ego-""I"".

Therefore,what is the nature, condition, or state of an ""object"" when ""it"" is not being viewed from any point of view in space and time.   Apart from point of view, are there any ""objects"" (as such), or any differences at all?   Or, rather, if all possible ""objects"" or ""differences"" are simultaneously existing, as they must be, unless and until point of view differentiates and particularizes them, then what is the nature, condition, or state of that simultaneous totality?   Apart from the defining and categorizing done by the presumed separate ego-""I"", What IS that totality beyond perspective, and thoughts, and every now of time, and every place of space-locatedness?

"As I see it, Ovidiu is correct in saying      _Or, put differently, the essential idea here is an anthropological one: the teleology of man is to be united with God (to become god through grace)._      Yes. Theosis was not part of God's plan _as a result_ of the Fall. And therefore fc rightly observes      _It was always G-d's intention to offer theosis._      And Anonymous rightly says      _As fc stated before, the Incarnation must have been foreseen before Time,_      But it **does not follow** from this that God DECIDED upon the Incarnation _because_ he foreknew about the Fall. This makes God's action to be _**caused by**_ Adam's action, which is wrong. So, we need to be more circumspect in how we describe it:      God intended theosis in the very formation of human nature;   He knew from all eternity that Adam would Fall;   He intended from all eternity to rescue man from the Fall;   He intended from all eternity to accomplish that rescue by the Incarnation.      _In a certain sense_ God's intending the Incarnation ""hinged upon"" Adam's sin, and it is in this sense that we refer to that sin as ""O Happy Fault!"". But of course every sin (and certainly that first human sin) is wrong, and ought to be repudiated; Adam (as Tradition has it, saved in the long run) would have had to have remorse for said sin, and remorse _just is_ an internal position of repudiation of the sin in terms of its wrongness and its guiltiness. But any sinner can regret the _wrongness_ of the sin while being grateful to God for some _goodness_ which God brings out of the sin through his power.      And since God wills _primarily_ the goodness **of the ENTIRE ORDER of the created providential order rather than the goodness of any one element thereof, (in willing Creation), He wills most especially the unifying principle of goodness of that created order - which (the saints tell us) is the Incarnation, in that the Son's union of divinity with a created nature ennobles the entire created order, as well as making possible (due to sin) the theosis of the highest natural beings, which is _their_ proper end, and thus the highest good of the highest natural beings.      To get bound up in whether God willed the Incarnation _because of_ the Fall is to get caught in a web of wrong questions. **",see ovidiu correct saying put differently essential idea anthropological one teleology man united god become god grace yes theosis part plan result fall therefore fc rightly observes always g-ds intention offer theosis anonymous rightly say fc stated incarnation must foreseen time follow god decided upon incarnation foreknew fall make action caused action wrong need circumspect describe god intended theosis formation human nature knew eternity adam would fall intended eternity rescue man fall intended eternity accomplish rescue incarnation certain sense intending incarnation hinged upon sin sense refer sin happy fault course every sin certainly first human sin wrong ought repudiated adam tradition saved long run would remorse said sin remorse internal position repudiation sin term wrongness guiltiness sinner regret wrongness sin grateful god goodness god brings sin power since god will primarily goodness entire order created providential order rather goodness one element thereof willing creation will especially unifying principle goodness created order - saint tell u incarnation union divinity created nature ennobles entire created order well making possible due sin theosis highest natural being proper end thus highest good highest natural being get bound whether god willed incarnation fall get caught web wrong question,feser,2298,0,2517
"I would add: if one is growing, and the other is not, **that very growth** should imply you exercise patience and understanding toward the one lagging behind. If you have been given a gift more than another person, do not cast off the other as unworthy: it was a GIFT to you, not your own merit that brought it. Why, therefore, would you despise the person who has not received the gift, in which state _you would still be if you had not been granted the gift?_      And further: by patiently asking God that He also shower your spouse with comparable gifts of growth, mayhap you will merit God granting such growth. So: your observing a lack in your spouse is _reason to do something to help your spouse (by prayer and sacrifice),_ not reason to leave.      And further: do not let pride deceive you: if you see that you have grown in _one_ way (where your spouse has not), never forget that perhaps your spouse has grown in 3 or 4 ways less visible, where you have not. There are a thousand different avenues of growth, not one or two. God works at a different pace in each area, for each person. And not all growth is manifest to either the person growing or to those around.      Never imagine that ""incompatibility"" due to one person growing and the other not constitutes a basis for believing the marriage is ""void"". God's will for marriage is that it persist through life, even in difficult times, even in the difficulties of difficult personality clashes. Growth, alone, is not incompatibility, and even if there were some incompatibility - even if (in spite of charitable efforts) one spouse becomes _impossible_ to live with, (say, you became a Catholic and your spouse simply could not stand that) and a legal separation is necessary, that **does not void or break** the marriage, it merely means that you should live apart from your spouse for some time. He or she remains your spouse, until death, just a spouse separated from you.

"I've only just started reviewing but I think his intuition is sound. The puzzle raised by modal collapse arguments is how a simple God can be intrinsically the same across different possible worlds (worlds with different creations or no creations at all). Yet, if you accept that God's essence is necessary, as most theistic critics of divine simplicity do, Tomaszewski shows that you have the same problem: the non-simple God's necessary essence is the same across all possible worlds, including any intrinsic, contingent properties of God. But those intrinsic properties are grounded in God's necessary essence and thus are themselves necessary. In other words, you get the same ""modal collapse,"" except that what collapses is not only creation but God himself. At least, this is my very crude rendition of the argument.      So, the burden on the theistic personalist (such as Ryan Mullins) is to explain: If you contend that God's essence is necessary, how do you account for the contingency of those properties that are grounded in God's essence? And, if you can offer such an account, why can't the same apply to a simple God?      Perhaps the theistic personalist can respond: God's contingent properties are not grounded in His essence; rather, they are not grounded in anything at all. God is a composite of a necessary essence and various contingent properties; the act of creation arises from one of those contingent properties.      Tomaszewski doesn't say this but I think the same issue applies to a naturalist who believes there is a necessary, natural foundation to reality (I think this is Oppy's view). Except that the naturalist can argue that the necessary foundation creates through an entirely random, non-deterministic process -- which is not an option open for any traditional theist.",ive started reviewing think intuition sound puzzle raised modal collapse argument simple god intrinsically across different possible world world different creation creation yet accept essence necessary theistic critic divine simplicity tomaszewski show problem non-simple necessary essence across possible world including intrinsic contingent property god intrinsic property grounded necessary essence thus necessary word get modal collapse except collapse creation god least crude rendition argument burden theistic personalist ryan mullins explain contend essence necessary account contingency property grounded essence offer account apply simple god perhaps theistic personalist respond contingent property grounded essence rather grounded anything god composite necessary essence various contingent property act creation arises one contingent property tomaszewski say think issue applies naturalist belief necessary natural foundation reality think view except naturalist argue necessary foundation creates entirely random non-deterministic process -- option open traditional theist,feser,1808,0,2521

But that jump is something that **can only be grasped by the immaterial intellect,** not by the physical senses alone. That's why we empiricists and dualists can not agree.

"An essential part of the interpretative context is surely Pope Francis' Apostolic Exhortation 'Evangelii Gaudium': 'On the Proclamation of the Gospel in Today's World' - considered a keynote document of his pontificate, and running to 288 numbered paragraphs. Less authoritative and isolated statements should be interpreted in the light of more authoritative and extended statements such as this.      A few quotes:      ‘Throughout the world, let us be “permanently in a state of mission”.’ (25; cf. passim)      ‘All the baptized, whatever their position in the Church or their level of instruction in the faith, are agents of evangelization.’ (120)      ‘All revealed truths derive from the same divine source and are to be believed with the same faith…’ (36)      ‘Of course, we will never be able to make the Church’s teachings easily understood or readily appreciated by everyone. Faith always remains something of a cross; it retains a certain obscurity which does not detract from the firmness of its assent.’ (42)      ‘Proclaiming the Gospel message to different cultures also involves proclaiming it to professional, scientific and academic circles. This means an encounter between faith, reason and the sciences with a view to developing new approaches and arguments on the issue of credibility, a creative apologetics which would encourage greater openness to the Gospel on the part of all. When certain categories of reason and the sciences are taken up into the proclamation of the message, these categories then become tools of evangelization; water is changed into wine.’ (132)      ‘Evangelization with joy becomes beauty in the liturgy, as part of our daily concern to spread goodness. The Church evangelizes and is herself evangelized through the beauty of the liturgy, which is both a celebration of the task of evangelization and the source of her renewed self-giving.’ (24)      ‘As the bishops of the United States of America have rightly pointed out, while the Church insists on the existence of objective moral norms which are valid for everyone, there are those in our culture who portray this teaching as unjust, that is, as opposed to basic human rights. Such claims usually follow from a form of moral relativism that is joined, not without inconsistency, to a belief in the absolute rights of individuals.’ (64)      ‘Among the vulnerable for whom the Church wishes to care with particular love and concern are unborn children, the most defenceless and innocent among us. Nowadays efforts are made to deny them their human dignity and to do with them whatever one pleases, taking their lives and passing laws preventing anyone from standing in the way of this. Frequently, as a way of ridiculing the Church’s effort to defend their lives, attempts are made to present her position as ideological, obscurantist and conservative. Yet this defence of unborn life is closely linked to the defence of each and every other human right… This is not something subject to alleged reforms or “modernizations”. It is not “progressive” to try to resolve problems by eliminating a human life.’ (213)      ‘A facile syncretism would ultimately be a totalitarian gesture on the part of those who would ignore greater values of which they are not the masters. True openness involves remaining steadfast in one’s deepest convictions, clear and joyful in one’s own identity, while at the same time being “open to understanding those of the other party” and “knowing that dialogue can enrich each side” (John Paul II). What is not helpful is a diplomatic openness which says “yes” to everything in order to avoid problems, for this would be a way of deceiving others and denying them the good which we have been given to share generously with others. Evangelization and interreligious dialogue, far from being opposed, mutually support and nourish one another.’ (251)      All this may not resolve all the issues with things Francis has said and done, but it needs to be taken into account.

"@the most recently posting anonymous.      I am not sure what you are talking about in stating that there are no Scriptures that teach that people are in hell.

"UncommonDescent,      1.      I probably admire the ancient Greeks as much as anyone. They were not of one mind. They got much wrong. But mostly, I believe, they got people to think. I see this as their strength. It's why they're still relevant.      We could probably spend days on Heraclitean flux alone. Heraclitus himself wasn't very clear. I doubt he was talking about the immateriality you are. But I'm not going to pursue that.      You say immateriality is stability. I wonder how you'll prove immateriality is stable. Regardless, you say a scientist changes across experiments. Probably so. I suppose that's the point of the experiment -- to gain knowledge and therefore change for the better. We humans pretty much agree we are not perfect. So how much stability is desirable in this circumstance? IMO, a desire to remain the same is not an obvious good. I desire to change toward the good. If immateriality is stability, maybe immateriality is not so good for us. If it is ""the good"" why doesn't it steer us away from our faults? Why isn't it good enough? Why does it take the scientist's experiment to change us rather than relying on the immateriality to work its magic by itself? And if it does work its magic, hasn't it become the agent of change? That's a paradox -- the stability of immateriality becomes the agent of change -- that is, it mocks stability.      You say if the scientist is not the same, he won't be able to understand what he was doing. That is a non sequitur. He may be better able to understand what he was doing. Change in itself does not imply confusion. It does not imply a worsening condition. It does not imply total change. A rock changes nanosecond by nanosecond. But it still hangs onto its rockness. Maybe that's all Heraclitus was trying to convey. The whole has to consider a thing's changing nature. Change, not immateriality, is part of the whole. Change is the only permanence, the ultimate whole.      You say immateriality is wholeness. It cannot be wholeness if it requires the material to form a whole. Maybe you mean we cannot consider the whole without considering immateriality? If so, I always have to ask why you think so? How can something that has no practical way of affecting me be required to complete me? How am I supposed to react to this immateriality? What difference is it supposed to make in my life? How would I know it's behind the curtains of my every thought? How would my thoughts change (or not change!) because of it? The bottom line for me is always going to boil down to this question: How can something that I can never know at all be a factor in my life (or reality)?      2 & 3.      In my philosophy, causation is not imposed by our neuronal tissue upon the world. The world does not care what we think about it. It goes about its business no matter how much we protest.

"I also posted a response in the same thread that addressed the problem of natural evil. I wrote:      The problem of evil in terms of natural disaster seems to call into question God's goodness or justice in a way that the problem of moral evil does not. The problem of moral evil is dissolved by the recognition of creatures who are contingently good by a free will. It impugns neither God's goodness nor God's power. While this problem is dissolved primarily in term of an exposition of God's power (it does not impugn anyone's power to say that He cannot draw a square circle nor created an uncreated being--i.e. one that is necessarily good and created), the latter problem must be resolved in terms of an exposition of God's Goodness and particularly His justice.      How could it be just for an innocent baby to suffer from cancer or a tornado when he has done no wrong? How could a just God allow this to occur? Although the question is made palpable by our experience of suffering, it needs to be analyzed deeply if we are going to come to terms with it in a reasonable way. In other words, we must not allow a visceral first response to the question to keep us from examining the premises behind the question.      For example, the most fundamental premise is that our greatest good lies in the avoidance of temporary suffering and that a loving and just God would not allow us to undergo temporary suffering. However, this premise is problematic. A just and loving father will allow his son to train for football when this entails some level of intense and even sustained suffering for something that can only be achieved through such suffering. There is a higher good in mind that the dad and the coach see more clearly than the linebacker son who is struggling through the two a days with asthma. In this instance, the parent and coach have an understanding of the value of the end goal and how it is worthy of pursuit and even suffering.      With this in mind, it is important to analyze more deeply the premise that temporary suffering is the greatest evil that we could possibly endure. That premise either presupposes materialism and that the body is all that there is. If this were the case, bodily suffering would be the worst thing possible and should be avoided at all costs. However, such a view does not disprove God's existence; it presupposes that he does not exist. If however we recognize the existence of an immaterial soul, we have to assess the relation of the body and the soul. If the soul is more noble than the body, could we not justify bodily suffering for the good of the soul? Could not bodily suffering be *useful* for the good of the soul in that it helps us to recognize that the material world is temporary as it is subject to decay? This is precisely how the Catholic Tradition understands both the voluntary suffering of self denial which occurs, for example, through fasting and involuntary suffering that occurs through events outside our control. Such bodily suffering can be good for our own soul and our own suffering can be good for the soul of others as well. If there is a soul that is more noble than the body and is eternal, it is the eternal happiness of the soul that is most important and not the temporary pleasure or displeasure of the body (This is not to say that the body is bad or that pleasure is bad per se. It is only to recognize that pleasure is not ultimate because the body is a lower good than the soul).",also posted response thread addressed problem natural evil wrote problem evil term natural disaster seems call question goodness justice way problem moral evil problem moral evil dissolved recognition creature contingently good free impugns neither goodness power problem dissolved primarily term exposition power impugn power say can not draw square circle created uncreated being -- ie one necessarily good created latter problem must resolved term exposition goodness particularly justice could innocent baby suffer cancer tornado done wrong could god allow occur although question made palpable experience suffering need analyzed deeply going come term reasonable way word must allow visceral first response question keep u examining premise behind question example fundamental premise greatest good lie avoidance temporary suffering loving god would allow u undergo temporary suffering however premise problematic loving father allow son train football entail level intense even sustained suffering something achieved suffering higher good mind dad coach see clearly linebacker son struggling two day asthma instance parent coach understanding value end goal worthy pursuit even suffering mind important analyze deeply premise temporary suffering greatest evil could possibly endure premise either presupposes materialism body case bodily suffering would worst thing possible avoided cost however view disprove existence presupposes exist however recognize existence immaterial soul ass relation body soul soul noble body could justify bodily suffering good soul could bodily suffering useful good soul help u recognize material world temporary subject decay precisely catholic tradition understands voluntary suffering self denial occurs example fasting involuntary suffering occurs event outside control bodily suffering good soul suffering good soul others well soul noble body eternal eternal happiness soul important temporary pleasure displeasure body say body bad pleasure bad per se recognize pleasure ultimate body lower good soul,feser,3476,0,2558
"Hi Ed,      You write that ""Honorius, unlike Agatho, was capable of erring in his own letter because he was not there speaking ex cathedra."" I have to say that this statement is anachronistic. The term ""ex cathedra"" dates from the Middle Ages, and the modern doctrine of papal infallibility was first proposed by bishop Guido Terreni in 1332. To be sure, the formula of Hormisdas (519) declares that ""in the Apostolic See the Catholic religion has always been kept unsullied,"" but (a) it was written before Honorius became Pope, (b) it refers to the Apostolic See, not the Roman Pope, and (c) it says nothing about there being different categories of papal pronouncements (reformable and irreformable).      You also suggest that in the case of a future Pope who, while not speaking ex cathedra, nevertheless teaches error, the Church ""will come to judge harshly any pope who fomented such a crisis."" I'm not so sure. The reason why the third ecumenical council of Constantinople (680-681) was able to condemn Pope Honorius was precisely because its bishops had never been handpicked by him, whereas today, all bishops in the Latin Church are appointed by the Pope, and typically, most of the Cardinals who will elect the next Pope were handpicked by the current one. Thus it appears extremely unlikely that the bishops, speaking in unison, will judge any Pope harshly.

"Vincent, at the risk of being a scold, you should really know better than to throw out some of these criticisms, most of which are either misunderstandings or irrelevancies. You've been around here long enough to be able to get the picture:      1) Parts stand in potential to the whole qua substance. The whole stands in potential to the parts qua composite. The claim is not that the whole is prior to the part in literally every respect. So of course the Thomist can have both statements, because the statements aren't claiming incompatible things.      2) Who knows whether nebulae, galaxies, etc. are substances? My suspicion is no, but that the question is a difficult one to answer as a matter of fact shouldn't much be surprising. Nothing about hylomorphism says it must be easy to discern what is a substance and what is not.      3) Koons explicitly rejects the idea that particles are fundamental, so this is a moot point.      4) For heaven's sake, not this objection of ""Aristotle's science held different conclusions and paradigms from contemporary science"" again.

"Hi Ed,      On the topic of classical theism: I was just wondering if you'd read (or heard of) a book called ""God: An Anatomy"" by Professor Francesca Stavrakopoulou. The author studied theology at Oxford, where she was also awarded her doctorate. She is currently Professor of Hebrew Bible and Ancient Religion at the University of Exeter, UK. Here's what John Barton, Emeritus Professor at Oriel College, Oxford and author of ""A History of the Bible,"" has to say about the book:      ""In both Judaism and Christianity God is conceived as non-physical. In 'God: An Anatomy' Francesca Stavrakopoulou shows that this was not yet so in the Bible, where God appears in a much more corporeal form. This provocative work will surprise and may shock, but it brings to light aspects of the biblical account of God that modern readers seldom appreciate.""      Professor Stavrakopoulou contends that even in the New Testament, God is conceived of as physical. You might be thinking, ""What about John 4:24, which says that God is spirit (pneuma)?"" However, on page 409 of her book, Professor Stavrakopoulou addresses this objection: ""For most first-century philosophers, pneuma was not the abstract immateriality of Platonic theory, but an airy yet material substance pervading the cosmos, much as Stoic thinkers imagined. Its fiery heat and dynamism gave it a generative quality easily qualified as divine in origin."" In other words, it was a ""potent exhalation of God"" (p. 410), capable of permeating the human body, which is how Mary was able to conceive after ""holy pneuma"" overshadowed her, and how the disciples at Pentecost were able to speak in tongues after being filled with ""holy pneuma."" In John's Gospel, there is a subtle change: ""the holy pneuma that penetrates the disciples' bodies is Christ's own breath,"" which is why Jesus says ""Receive holy pneuma,"" when he breathes on his disciples after his resurrection. Finally, all Scripture is said to be God-breathed (2 Timothy 3:16).      It was not until the mid-second century that Christians began to conceive of God as wholly incorporeal. The problem here is that according to Catholic teaching, the meaning of Scripture is the meaning intended by the human sacred author: ""the interpreter of Sacred Scripture, in order to see clearly what God wanted to communicate to us, should carefully investigate what meaning the sacred writers really intended, and what God wanted to manifest by means of their words"" (Dei Verbum 12). If Professor Stavrakopoulou is right, none of the sacred writers intended to assert that God is incorporeal, let alone simple; hence it cannot be taught by Scripture.

" _I don't see how a 96 year old or 100 year old man can run the Church?_      Leo XIII did pretty well.      _There is after all a reason why Cardinals 80 years or older cannae vote in Papal Conclaves._      I feel quite strongly that this is actually a definite mistake for the Church. I agree that a bishop, or cardinal in the Vatican, needn't be assumed to have an active role of governance in their 80's. But until a man has reached dementia, his wisdom into his 80's is a positive treasure for the Church, and a conclave to vote for a pope is not _physically_ taxing the way constant duties would be.      More importantly, having octogenarians retain their vote (if compos mentis) is an _important_ stabilizer for the Church. In holding office now for just under 10 years, Francis has virtually re-made the college of cardinals in terms of its voting members, by ""stacking"" the deck with just about 65% of the voting cardinals. If he holds even one more consistory, he will push that well over 67%. And given that Francis, unlike his predecessors, has been appointing men in his own mold, his choosing will have a predominant influence over the voting _even though he won't have appointed half the cardinals_.      On the whole, while _there is_ a serious issue with a man like bishop or pope holding office into his dotage, where it is not he who is governing but his appointed subordinates, it is not best solved with an automatic retirement age. This fact has been handily shown in secular affairs. Other mechanisms are called for. For bishops, for example, instead of having them submit their resignation at 75, it should be possible for him to appoint a group of 5 (his own) trusted subordinates (including at least 1 or 2 doctors) to ascertain his capacity for ongoing independent decision-making and certify this to the pope.      As for the pope, while I can see that having a similar mechanism might be a very bad idea, I also see that the Church managed for 2000 years with old popes, many of whom gradually lost their ability to function and died in office. I do not think that the most recent example, Benedict, is a great shining example of a pope stepping down at ""the right time"": maybe, maybe, he had some disabled capacity that he had not disclosed (and never did disclose) that was clearly the sort of disability under which he could not execute the office of pope. But...wouldn't it have been better to _disclose_ exactly that which made his choice necessary? And that's the crux: from the example of 260 prior popes, resignation should not be an ""option"" like retiring from your job, where you can either stay or go depending on your preferences; it should only chosen out of necessity, and the _necessity_ (typically) can be exhibited at least in general form, and _should_ be made public in justice to those for whom he is the ""servant of the servants of the poor"". Possibly Pope JPII overdid the idea of staying in office and offering up his suffering while trying to muddle through, but it is equally possible that Benedict overdid the idea of leaving before his encroaching incapacity harmed the Church.      We will not and _cannot_ know for sure, and I don't presume to judge Benedict. God knows, and I hope and pray that God has already said to him ""welcome, my good and faithful servant.""

First of all, there are the idealized _models_ by which we bring abstractions like the laws of physics to bear on concrete reality. For example, when we apply Newton’s laws to the solar system, we do so by modeling the latter (in terms of a system of point masses orbiting a larger point mass, and so on). In this way, our application of abstractions is mediated by further abstractions. There are also the concrete _narratives_ by which all of these abstractions are made intelligible. (Think of the way that, in order to understand even a simple system like the solar system, we still have crudely to visualize large objects moving through space over time around other large objects; that in order to understand the implications of special relativity, we tell stories about twins traveling on rocket ships; and so on.)

"The bishop's office of ""teacher"" is not exercised ONLY when he _expressly_ ""intends to bind the faithful"" in an _unreserved_ way, for a bishop _cannot_ bind the faithful in that way because he is not infallible. But he still exercises the office of teacher when he teaches in such a way that he expects his people to hear _and receive and be guided by_ his teaching. This is what the magisterial office _means_. The pope, in exercising his _ordinary_ office of bishop of Rome, exercises the same magisterial authority as any bishop does. But by being the pope, his teaching acts also teach the whole world. It is impossible for him to teach ""just Rome"" and not implicitly teach to the world.      Just as is true of ALL the bishops, who teach their teachings in various **degrees** of definitude by which they intend others to receive them, so also does the pope. When he indicates, by details such as formality of venue, tone of voice, and declarative mood, that a teaching is more definitive than usual, we are obliged to give it a greater degree of respect, (i.e. to assent to it with less _reserve_ than usual). As a result of these truths, it will be automatically the case that when the pope wishes to be _especially_ definitive, he will typically be doing so especially _to the world_. But even THERE, he has degrees available: if the pope gives a speech to an international forum of obstetricians and speaks there about the immorality of certain tubal ligations (as contraceptive), it is inevitable that he be speaking broadly to the whole world, in that those doctors are from the whole world and will repeat his teaching around the world. But the venue is not as _formal_ as an encyclical, and so has a lesser degree of definitude - lesser sense that he ""intends to bind"" - as to that aspect. The intention he has is CAPABLE OF DEGREE. Hence the deference we give it must be capable of degree.      Once we realize that religious assent - the kind of assent that is not the ""unreserved"" assent given to infallible teachings - is **reserved** assent, we must realize that it comes in many flavors just as do the reservations by which it is not **UN** reserved. And the _intention to bind_ is also present in many degrees.",office teacher exercised expressly intends bind faithful unreserved way bishop can not bind faithful way infallible still exercise office teacher teach way expects people hear receive guided teaching magisterial office mean pope exercising ordinary office bishop rome exercise magisterial authority bishop pope teaching act also teach whole world impossible teach rome implicitly teach world true bishop teach teaching various degree definitude intend others receive also pope indicates detail formality venue tone voice declarative mood teaching definitive usual obliged give greater degree respect ie assent le reserve usual result truth automatically case pope wish especially definitive typically especially world even degree available pope give speech international forum obstetrician speaks immorality certain tubal ligation contraceptive inevitable speaking broadly whole world doctor whole world repeat teaching around world venue formal encyclical lesser degree definitude - lesser sense intends bind - aspect intention capable degree hence deference give must capable degree realize religious assent - kind assent unreserved assent given infallible teaching - reserved assent must realize come many flavor reservation un reserved intention bind also present many degree,feser,2230,0,2586

" _But he looks around and sees actually good people, people with special abilities and excellence, and he realizes how unworthy he is of Heaven,_      In addition to the replies above, I want to focus on this notion. First, ""special abilities"" **never was** any aspect of being ""qualified"" for heaven. Take, for example, St. Peter. If you examine his behavior in the Gospels and Acts, you find a guy - a mere fisherman - who constantly puts his foot in his mouth, who berates God, and who runs away from a friend in great need. Eventually, he did clean up his act, but - as with all the saints - he attributed this to **favors he was granted out of God's overflowing gifts** , not out of his own merit.      ""and excelllence"". Again the ONLY excellence that technically qualifies is the **love of God** by which you act rightly in all your acts, and this is (again) always due to God's beneficent favor, not our own merit. All we can claim is to have _remained in cooperation_ with said grace, rather than repudiating it. St. Francis said that greater good would be found in a man merely picking a piece of straw out of the road, if done with perfect love of God, than in a great many great sacrifices suffered with imperfect love.      What you are confusing in ""excellences"" is the acts of HEROIC virtues by which the Church _locates and confirms canonized_ saints, with the actual excellence needed, perfect love. But the life of a nun in a contemplative cloister, who spends her entire life _just FOLLOWING THE RULE_ with perfect charity, (and without any call by God to endure situations demanding heroic virtue), has just as much claim on being in heaven as some highly acclaimed saint who performed many wonders and miracles with love of God, or a saint who bore great visible sufferings for love of God. The Church never _expects_ to canonize all those who go to heaven: she uses the test of heroic virtue as an empirical source of _evidence for_ the required love of God, but she does not deny the same love might persist in many who do not demonstrate it VISIBLY in great events.      And if you die in the state of grace but highly imperfect in your love of God, your time in Purgatory will correct that, and you will get to heaven with perfect love of God - just like the acclaimed and cannonized saints.",look around see actually good people people special ability excellence realizes unworthy heaven addition reply want focus notion first special ability never aspect qualified heaven take example st peter examine behavior gospel act find guy - mere fisherman - constantly put foot mouth berates god run away friend great need eventually clean act - saint - attributed favor granted overflowing gift merit excelllence excellence technically qualifies love god act rightly act always due beneficent favor merit claim remained cooperation said grace rather repudiating st francis said greater good would found man merely picking piece straw road done perfect love god great many great sacrifice suffered imperfect love confusing excellence act heroic virtue church locates confirms canonized saint actual excellence needed perfect love life nun contemplative cloister spends entire life following rule perfect charity without call god endure situation demanding heroic virtue much claim heaven highly acclaimed saint performed many wonder miracle love god saint bore great visible suffering love god church never expects canonize go heaven us test heroic virtue empirical source evidence required love god deny love might persist many demonstrate visibly great event die state grace highly imperfect love god time purgatory correct get heaven perfect love god - like acclaimed cannonized saint,feser,2316,0,2600

So Mother Nature allows for non- reproductive sex up to a point (small pockets of the population). It's a deleterious trait, so it has to be kept in check.

"WCB,      I have already noted Komline's Augustine on the Will in the Oxford Historical Theology series published in 2019. I have also noted some of the relevant works of St. Augustine that you are not familiar with that show that he did not change his position. The work that shows this most clearly is a work written by St. Augustine at the end of his life called: The Retractions. St. Augustine knew that his writings would be maintained and widely read after his death because his fame was already so widespread during his life. He was also, like any faithful Catholic, concerned about orthodoxy and that he did not lead others into error in any way. This reflects his charity, which is why he was a saint.      In order to ensure that any mistakes in his writings did not lead others astray, he read through them at the end of his life carefully and retracted any statements that were erroneous. Such retractions are found in his work: The Retractions. This is relevant for our discussion because he revisited his early Cassiacum dialogues, including On the Freedom of the Will. And did he make the sweeping assertion that he completely rejected his early account of the will in this work? Nope. He made small and precise corrections to his cassiacum dialogues while continuing to hold to his main lines of argument within them.      St. Augustine was a clear, compelling, cogent, and precise thinker. That precision entailed that he avoided gross and unsupported generalizations of the sort that fly off your keyboard, WCB. So, no he didn't ""reject his account of the will"". That sweeping generalization has as much support as your other sweeping generalizations. That is, it has no support.

"@ Laudator Temporis Acti,      I am breaking down the fairly complex sentence for purposes of analysis.

Leaving out the disputed phrase this becomes, ""Does not this indeterminacy mean that it can never be settled?""      Replacing the disputed phrase, with a single word object for the preposition, this becomes, ""Does not this indeterminacy WITHIN SOME mean that it can never be settled?""      SOME = ""We who have not yet suffered death""      This is a noun clause. It is the object of the preposition ""within"". It is a dependent clause and must exist in some relation with the rest of the sentence. It cannot stand alone as an independent sentence. The preposition ""within"" connects this dependent clause with the sentence. The entire clause is the object of the preposition. Otherwise the rest of the clause, ""who have not yet suffered death"", would be standing alone with no connection to the sentence.      Let us look at the clause in isolation by making it independent.      ""We, who have not yet suffered death, pause.""      ""Us, who have not yet suffered death, pause""      You choose.

"In a just defensive war, to refuse to fight to defend one’s fellow citizens without special reason (perhaps priests and doctors should not kill) is wrong. But a grave harm is done to a conscientious objector who is gotten to fight by legal incentives. Let’s think through the five considerations above. The first mainly applies to laws prohibiting a behavior rather than ones requiring a behavior. Short of brainwashing, it is impossible to _make_ someone fight. (We could superglue their hands to a gun, and then administer electric shocks causing their fingers to spasm and fire a bullet, but that wouldn’t count as _fighting_.) The second applies somewhat: we do need to weigh the harms to innocent citizens from enemy invaders, harms that might be prevented if our conscientious objector fought. But note that there is something rather speculative about these harms. Someone who fights contrary to conscience is unlikely to be a very effective fighter, and it is far from clear that their military activity would actually prevent any actual harm to innocents. Now, regarding the third consideration, one can design a conscription law with an exemption that few who aren’t conscientious objectors would take advantage of. One way to do this is to require evidence of one’s conscience’s objection to fighting (e.g., prior membership in a pacifist organization). Another way is to impose non-combat duties on conscientious objectors that are as onerous and maybe as dangerous as combat would be. Regarding the fourth consideration, it seems unlikely that a typical conscientious objector’s objections to war would be changed by legal penalties. And the fifth seems a weak consideration in general. Putting all these together, we do not outweigh the _prima facie_ considerations against pressuring conscientious objectors to act against their (mistaken) conscience from the harms in going against conscience.",defensive war refuse fight defend fellow citizen without special reason perhaps priest doctor kill wrong grave harm done conscientious objector gotten fight legal incentive think five consideration first mainly applies law prohibiting behavior rather one requiring behavior short brainwashing impossible make someone fight could superglue hand gun administer electric shock causing finger spasm fire bullet count fighting second applies somewhat need weigh harm innocent citizen enemy invader harm might prevented conscientious objector fought note something rather speculative harm someone fight contrary conscience unlikely effective fighter far clear military activity would actually prevent actual harm innocent regarding third consideration one design conscription law exemption conscientious objector would take advantage one way require evidence objection fighting eg prior membership pacifist organization another way impose non-combat duty conscientious objector onerous maybe dangerous combat would regarding fourth consideration seems unlikely typical conscientious objection war would changed legal penalty fifth seems weak consideration general putting together outweigh prima facie consideration pressuring conscientious objector act mistaken conscience harm going conscience,pruss,1908,1,2660

"The famous paragraph slipped into the Fourth Council of Constantinople’s deliberations had more to do with the inflamed politics of the East than the wrongs of Pope Honorius. The Lateran Council of 649, rejecting Monothelitism, had blamed the orientals, making no mention of Pope Honorius. Pope Agatho got his legates to bring to the Council of Constantinople a letter in which he stated: “From the day when the leaders of the Church of Constantinople tried to introduce heretical novelties in the immaculate Church of Christ, my predecessors never ceased to exhort them… that they had to abstain… [from proclaiming the error concerning the single will etc.]”.      The Council’s machinations contradicted Pope Agatho and resulted in a wording that was modified by Pope Leo II (upon receiving notice of its deliberations) when he ratified it. This was the version he then sent to Constantinople and all the bishops of the West. Pope Leo, in his explanation of the affair to the bishops of Spain, clearly distinguished between the list of heretics named by the Council, and Pope Honorius, censured for being negligent.         In a long article in the Dictionnaire de theolgie catholique (1931, the DTC was in another league entirely from the estimable Catholic Encyclopedia), Fr. E. Amann, professor of theology at Strasbourg, concludes: “For us, the two letters of Pope Honorius represent a doctrinal intervention of the Roman pontiff in a debated question: referring to previous decisions, without adding anything new to them except in manner, the pope teaches the theory of the two natures, each operating according to what is proper to it, and demands entire acceptance of this doctrine. Alongside this doctrinal teaching is a very unfortunate prescription on the silence to be kept relative to the formulas in dispute, ‘one or two energies’”.      He concludes that “… [Honorius’] thought carries greater weight than the formulas by which he expresses it, that these formulas themselves can with the greatest rigor uphold an interpretation which does not deviate too much from official orthodoxy. But to conclude from this, as many theologians have done, the perfect orthodoxy of the two letters of Honorius, there is, it seems, some distance.”      Had the Council made a dangerous mistake? “It would certainly have done so if, taking the question from an exclusively dogmatic point of view, it had passed a doctrinal and pointless judgment on the very teaching of Honorius….[because Honorius was basically orthodox, despite his expressions in these letters] the assembly set itself up as judge much less of a theology than of a type of conduct and those who engaged in it”.      The weak arguments made by some theologians mentioned in the post do not devalue their stronger ones – which don’t get a proper mention; the question of the Pope losing the faith, the issue of formal heresy dealt with by Bellarmine, surely deserves some explanation. As far as the history goes, Pope Honorius was NOT a heretic, and Fr. Chapman’s 100 page work does not establish it.      I think there is a distinction between ex cathedra infallibility (which permits no stain of error) and the foibles of Popes at other times which, however much destruction they cause, does not translate into meaning they can lose the faith. Obviously we aren’t expected to believe that off the cuff “magisterium” on planes is not free from tendentiousness to the point of destructive favouring of whatever error is in fashion.

"@Tony      In Benedict XVI's Foreword to his book 'Jesus of Nazareth' published during his pontificate, he wrote, 'It goes without saying that this book is in no way an exercise of the magisterium, but is solely an expression of my personal search for the face of the Lord. Everyone is free, then, to contradict me. I would only ask my readers for that initial goodwill without which there can be no understanding.' (It was understood by everyone as being written in his capacity 'as a private theologian'.)      The book had a certain impact around the world of Catholic thought, as he no doubt wished - partly caused by his pre-existing reputation as a theologian, but certainly added to by the simple fact that he was now pope. He wanted to 'teach' people, in a similar way to us wanting to 'teach' each other by posting on this blog - hopefully our motive is that we want to help one another on the path to truth. And he wanted to use his new platform as pope to reach a wider audience.      However, Benedict didn't want Catholics to consider themselves morally bound to accept what he said, just from the mere fact of who it was that said it. I don't think that this was particularly because he was tentative or uncertain about his statements in the book - maybe for some of them he was, others he wasn't. But rather, he wanted in this case to leave acceptance of what he was saying simply up to the free consideration of the individual. He didn't wish to 'bind' anyone.      So, he took off his 'pope' cap and put on his 'private theologian' cap, saying that his writing was solely an expression of his 'personal search for the face of the Lord' (despite presumably being motivated by wanting others to learn from his words and to be influenced by them).      Is that swapping of caps problematic on your view? I'm reading you (maybe) as saying or implying that the assertions of a pope in faith or morals cannot fail to be 'binding' on any Catholic to some extent, whether the pope likes it or not; or maybe that this is so, at least by default. That is (maybe unless the pope explicitly says otherwise, as with Benedict's book), Catholics should consider themselves morally bound to adhere (at least to some degree) to a pope's assertions in faith or morals, merely from the fact of who it is that is asserting them. This would be whether or not they are published in an official document, and whether or not they are promulgated to the whole Church: it is all 'teaching', and by a representative of Christ, and therefore magisterial.      So on this view, the official but private replies of Pope Honorius to Patriarch Sergius would be 'binding' to some extent on any Catholic who learnt of them and their contents.      And the plane interviews of Pope Francis would be to some small degree magisterial (if they concern faith or morals) - calling for our acceptance of his statements from the mere fact of who it is that is speaking and 'teaching'.

"I don’t really see that these areas of logic apply here, even in your category 3. If for example we assume one of the relational interpretations (RQM or QBISM), then there is a sense in which there are no physical properties at all ‘outside’ of an entanglement, or more specifically, outside an entanglement that shares information (eg. a measurement). So in this case, you could say that all physical properties are ultimately a relational representation. What is it that is being represented? Someone like Rovelli would say that there is nothing, everything is purely relational. I would argue that there is something more fundamental ‘underneath’, a substructure in which the ‘wholes’ of corporeal reality exist. The underlying forms unfold towards other forms as representation, which gives reality it’s consistent nature at a macro level.      However it doesn’t really matter which view you take, because the physical properties (the particle) are like an image of a process, and maybe of something deeper. Before the image is taken, it’s only a potential image. You can’t say it violates LNC any more than you could take a photo of Elvis, and say that Elvis is therefore both a person and a photo.

"I am glad we agree on the subject of heresy, and retract my comment that you were incorrect on that point.      But your point about the Council still does not stand. They were in fact making a *historical* claim in judging Honorius guilty of heresy. Councils can be incorrect about historical claims. You say this:       _First, the reason a council condemns someone as a heretic is because of his teaching. Hence it is, first and foremost, Honorius’s teaching that was condemned. That means that the teaching was judged heretical. But whether a teaching is heretical is a doctrinal matter, and not a mere historical matter. Now, given that a papally-approved council cannot err on doctrinal matters, it follows that the councils in question infallibly judged that Honorius’s teaching was heretical (whatever his intentions). But since anyone who teaches heresy is a heretic, it follows (at least given that Honorius really did write the letters that got him into trouble, as most of his defenders concede) that these councils did after all infallibly judge that Honorius was a heretic._      This does not follow. The councils judged that *monotheilitism was a heresy*, which is completely true. They then made the historical claim that *Honorius was a heretic*, which is not protected by any infallible charism whatsoever. The key point protected by infallibility is not that Honorius was a heretic; it's that monothelitism is a heresy. Whether or not Honorius actually taught monthelitism cannot be established merely by the council's say-so. That simply is not a doctrinal claim.      You then say this:       _Second, the reason most of Honorius’s defenders try to defend him is to avoid having to acknowledge that a pope can teach heresy when not speaking ex cathedra. Now, suppose that the councils did indeed get it wrong when judging that Honorius, specifically, was a heretic. Since that is a historical rather than doctrinal matter, such an error is possible. Still, by making this judgment, the councils also taught by implication that it is possible for a pope to teach heresy (when not speaking ex cathedra). And that is a doctrinal matter. That is enough to refute the larger claim that Honorius’s defenders are trying to uphold by defending him._      A Pope can speak heresy, potentially; a Pope cannot teach heresy in the capacity of utilizing his magisterial authority to bind the faithful to religious assent of will, because then the Magisterium would be leading the faithful off the path of salvation. And as you happily acknowledge, what the councils were condemning as heresy is not the understanding that Vatican I used and is in fact not sinful, because monothelitism had yet to be condemned directly in a Church council or by an authoritative papal teaching.      Also, I am supremely unconvinced that a private letter can ever be an act of Magisterial teaching in any case, and not simply the private opinion of the man who happened to be Pope.      Also you say this:       _Wright neglects to mention the opinion of St. Francis de Sales, who, when addressing papal authority in The Catholic Controversy, says that “we do not say that the Pope cannot err in his private opinions, as did John XXII, or be altogether a heretic, as perhaps Honorius was” (p. 225)._      Wright ""neglected to mention"" him because St. Francis De Sales is clearly not condemning Honorius, merely mentioning in passing that he PERHAPS was a heretic.

"**Response:** That may be right in the simple case. But now imagine that the “red” set is a saturated nonmeasurable subset of the spinner edge, and the “green” set is also such. A saturated nonmeasurable subset has no reasonable probability assignment, not even a non-trivial range of probabilities like from 1/3 to 1/2 (at best we can assign it the full range from 0 to 1).

"Mister Geocon, it could be dangerous to read all of Vatican II's documents in one go when its come to picking on it. There's no shortage of elements Vatican III will have to fix in view of the confusion among 90% caused by Vatican II texts themselves. The spirit of the times inside and outside the Church (which the Council ought to have dealt with, and would have, if Archbishop you-know- who and others in the preparatory commissions had been allowed to finish their work), did the rest.      How about this definition of the Mass, truly ""pregnant"" with possibility?: ""Therefore the eucharistic celebration is the center of the assembly of the faithful over which the priest presides. Hence priests teach the faithful to offer the divine victim to God the Father in the sacrifice of the Mass and with the victim to make an offering of their whole life"".      Or that the Church is now only the ""general means of salvation"", rather than the only means; that ""the Church of Christ"" ""subsists"" in the Catholic Church and in ""elements"" outside it? There are many others that chime along with the spirit of the times that good shepherds would have warded off.      Yes, I know that all these texts can have charitable interpretations.Like Popes Honorius and John XXII, the Council has not renounced the faith, just created problems for the faithful (in among its good work).

"Schrödinger’s Cat works chiefly as a _reductio ad absurdum_ of the naively narrow interpretation of what it means to be an ‘observer’ in the quantum- theory sense. Unfortunately, it is generally cited by people who hold the very interpretation that it discredits; and being unable to see that it is discredited, they base all their further thoughts on this subject upon the same falsehood.      Look: At the level of elementary particles, human beings do not observe quantum phenomena. In the thought experiment, the cat is killed by an apparatus that goes off when a Geiger counter detects the decay of an atom. As Bohr pointed out, the Geiger counter itself is the observer of the quantum event, and everything after that point is accounted for by plain old classical mechanics. None of the events on the macro scale are dependent upon single quantum-scale interactions. You could just as well set up the apparatus to kill the cat when a human being throws a switch, and it would make no difference in the operation either of the apparatus or of the cat. Similarly, you could rig a sensor circuit that would show immediately when the Geiger counter sends its signal, and so anticipate with certainty (by a fraction of a second) what is going to happen to the cat.      The idea that a _human_ observer is required to collapse a waveform, in fact, is nothing more than a silly bit of anthropocentrism.",schrödingers cat work chiefly reductio ad absurdum naively narrow interpretation mean ‘ observer quantum- theory sense unfortunately generally cited people hold interpretation discredit unable see discredited base thought subject upon falsehood look level elementary particle human being observe quantum phenomenon thought experiment cat killed apparatus go geiger counter detects decay atom bohr pointed geiger counter observer quantum event everything point accounted plain old classical mechanic none event macro scale dependent upon single quantum-scale interaction could well set apparatus kill cat human throw switch would make difference operation either apparatus cat similarly could rig sensor circuit would show immediately geiger counter sends signal anticipate certainty fraction second going happen cat idea human observer required collapse waveform fact nothing silly bit anthropocentrism,feser,1402,0,2709

"Certainly it would be absurd to suppose that such reasoning is like the hypothesis formation and testing familiar from natural science. For example, it would be absurd to suggest that something whose essence and existence are distinct might in principle be sustained in being by something other than _ipsum esse subsistens_ , and that we need to come up with some empirical test to show that this is unlikely. That would be as absurd as, say, a Platonist arguing that something other than the Form of the Good might in _principle_ be responsible for things having whatever measure of goodness they have, but that this is improbable given the empirical evidence. Or it is as absurd as a mathematician proposing that there is solid confirming empirical evidence that makes it probable that 12 x 48 = 576. The point isn’t that we don’t need to provide an argument for the claim that 12 x 48 = 576, or for the claim that there is such a thing as the Form of the Good, or, again, for the claim that the world could not exist even in principle apart from God. The point, again, is that the _kind_ of argumentation we would have to give would not involve forming hypotheses and then coming up with ways to test them empirically. That simply would not reflect the nature of mathematical facts, or the nature of the Form of the Good (if such a thing exists) and its relation to particular instances of goodness, or the nature of God and his relationship to the world.",certainly would absurd suppose reasoning like hypothesis formation testing familiar natural science example would absurd suggest something whose essence existence distinct might principle sustained something ipsum esse subsistens need come empirical test show unlikely would absurd say platonist arguing something form good might principle responsible thing whatever measure goodness improbable given empirical evidence absurd mathematician proposing solid confirming empirical evidence make probable x point need provide argument claim x claim thing form good claim world could exist even principle apart god point kind argumentation would give would involve forming hypothesis coming way test empirically simply would reflect nature mathematical fact nature form good thing exists relation particular instance goodness nature god relationship world,feser,1458,0,2713

The disciples of the disciples of the apostles would probably have better understood Jesus’ intended meaning than other Christian’s who were born much later, and hence the teachings of the Christians from the first 300 years AD would tilt the above 50-50 balance towards one side.      Below are some quotes about Christians’ view of possessions from the first few centuries. (BTW these are not about Communism, in case anyone is saying that the early Christians were Communists. The early Christians were not telling the wider society to sell possessions or share properties/goods).

" _Even in ordinary language, the term 'proselytism' does have a vaguely negative connotation these days, so it is fair enough that the Church has chosen to deploy it to denote negative ways of promoting the faith, while giving this clarifying definition in the 2007 document.   _      Fair enough. While giving the clarification. But then again: _Not_ fair enough absent the needed clarification, and certainly not when the clarification is being more or less actively undermined by other ambiguity.      And for particulars: one specific example used, of preaching for the ""gospel of prosperity"", I would argue is **not** a sound example. The pope argues that their interpretation of the gospel is in error, and their manner of persuading is unjust. As to the latter - maybe so, although I would want to see specifics to see what, precisely, is unjust. As to their erroneous interpretation - that is so, but (in many cases, though admittedly not in all) the preachers are _sincere_ in their misguided grasp of the gospel. So their error on this is in no way more damaging to the mere fact of their trying to persuade others, than is that of mainline Protestant churches, who also are in error in their interpretation of the gospels. The pope's singling out the mainline Protestants as being ""OK"", and the gospel of prosperity preachers being mean nasty ""proselytizers"" is - on this score - not consistent.      The real problem with the BAD kind of proselytism is that it uses as persuasive forces things that _should not_ be used so. It may use false premises. Or false logic. Or appeal to emotional ""motives"" that are not founded on reasonable bases. Or unreasonable threats of bad outcomes ""if you don't convert"". But mainline Protestants have used these tools also: e.g. they have used false premises in falsely characterizing the _Catholic_ teachings from which they depart. (E.G. ""Catholics worship Mary"".)      These kinds of tools are wrongly used in _Catholic_ hands, too, so it's not the _true proposition_ on account of which they are employed that is the problem with them, it is the manner in which they act on the hearer to cause belief.      Like with all the other times Francis has played funny games with the truth: it's not that his words cannot be understood - with added clarifications - that makes them fit well with Catholic teaching overall. It's that he persistently chooses to present so many of them in obscuring, confusing, problematic ways, and he rarely bothers to clarify later himself, leaving it to other organs of the Vatican to suggest clarifications, while he goes on blythely generating more confusing commentary. The issue with ""God intends a plurality of religions"" stuff is a perfect example: he went beyond appropriate bounds in a public document, his curia ""corrected"" the sense of the passage so as to mitigate the problem, and then later he again in signing yet another public document with the same sort of obscurantist language.      Francis has publicly ""justified"" his so-called ""carelessness"" in these confusing sayings / teachings, by _saying_ that he is careless. But from the fact that the errors and obscurantism all plays to one angle, it isn't truly an accidental kind of carelessness. And anyway, if a person knows he is careless in off-the-cuff remarks, (a) that does not excuse him from _not refraining_ from making such remarks where he could sow problems, and (b) it does not excuse him with respect to written documents published after (what should be) careful consideration.

"Denying final cause was essential to denying that we have obligations to a larger social order by nature rather than by consent. It was essential to modern liberalism’s project of making society a matter of choice or contract   Society by contract is not essentially liberal or modern. We know from history that many of the greatest civil societies (and all families) were founded by contract. Man is a substance in theory, and in each individual case, in a way essentially unlike any society can be. His individual existence is irrevocable, unlike societies apart from the Church. Civils societies don’t have an absolute existence, only a relative one; their ultimate end in the salvation of the individual, who pre-exists them. Making the individual relative to civil society is one of the greater heresies of conservatism.   That per se, such institutions are not invented by choice, but necessary by nature, is obvious. Nor are those born into them at liberty to refuse piety. It is far from this, however, to assert that particular civil societies cannot be established through contract, or “choice” of various kinds. This was denied by conservatives like de Maistre, who insisted civil society was established by God through his ministers the monarchs. Such writers often ran off to the OT to bring up the case of Israel.   The OT example proves them wrong. Only that nation could have been a religion/society as one thing. This could never happen again until the Enlightenment and its false philosophies divinised civil society. The political philosophy of St. Thomas reflected the society of modern scholastic writers like Francisco Suarez far better than that of his own time in fact. If we are to have a new political order beyond that of the present liberal disorder, we need to study the example of modern Catholic society first and foremost. This society, hegemonic for 150 years, took into account and countered the very philosophical errors that dominate now.   The Baroque world is the already existing counter-modernity, and cannot be ignored; the post was right to say that the first motor of change will be the Church – yet the healthiest and most dynamics elements in it are those that evoke Trent and Vatican I without scruple! The art and prayer of most of the Catholic world is the same as that of the early modern period, NOT the Middles Ages. The Church won’t find its feet through romanticism (the movement only helped kill off faith in those affected by it) – nor will civil society.   Medieval society, while admirable, arose to meet very different challenges, and its memory has now been defaced by romanticism and its ideology (with its iron grip over the hearts so many would-be Christians) to such an extent that it is hard to use it as a template. But Thomistic social texts suffer no such deformation, and go in hand with those of Suarez and his time, not Burke. Romanticism is all about constructing artificial societies based on myths about the past incorporating very modern ideologies. The supremacism of modern choice at its most attractive. Catholics should not buy it.

"@ Laudator Temporis Acti,      ""It does in math""      Even in math, truth never corresponds with popularity because math depends on the logic under which it is developed and even humans can develop a logic under which what is true in one system is false under another. Under what authority do you ban the rule of inference ""(A is true implies that A is false)""? If every mathematician in the world called such a rule lunacy, that would not be sufficient to ban it. Lunacy is not even a mathematical concept.      This proffered rule of inference is perhaps the logic of some rock. Since everything is false under its logic, it wills nothing, hence does nothing of its own will. Conventionally we say a rock does not have a will.      :-)      A lunatic has a logic somewhat damaged (by convention) but still closer to normal. He can will himself (usually) to put food into his mouth and even raid the fridge, and even if his neurons are so destroyed that he can't do that, his body will digest the food under its own degraded logic. Of course he could be dying, but that is to be undergoing a change of state to something that is no longer human (lacking a will).      Mathematics just is not objective, somehow outside of creation.

"Hi Eric,      Thanks for your response, in which you mentioned that “what happens if every Christian in fact did what the passages suggest. Now we have no possessions, no money, and are complete wards of the (non-Christian) state. What then? Doesn’t this strike one as an absurd situation?”      My fallible thought:   (1) Looking at what Acts (biblical document) and other non-biblical early Christian documents said, when Christians did that, they as a community still have possessions-in-common. They pooled their resources both in terms of money and in kind. They sold many possessions and pooled money together. They shared their unsold assets as common property among their Christian communities.   (2) Naturally the audience of Jesus, when they heard Jesus telling them to sell possessions and give to the needy (BTW the preserved memory of Jesus’ saying was not “sell ALL possessions”), they would have worried about how to have the basic necessities to survive (eg how to get food?). As characteristic of Jesus, he would say “You of little faith.” And in fact Jesus said that in the passage. Right before the “sell your possessions” (Luke 12.33) Jesus already addressed such natural concern: Don’t worry, have faith/trust in God; if you put God’s Kingdom first (eg by obeying Jesus), then God will provided the basic necessities (eg via natural means and thru human agents). In Luke 12.22-34 we read:      [quote] And Jesus said to the crowd, “Such is the one who stores up TREASURES for himself, and is not rich in relation to God. [referring to the story of an rich business man who grew his riches and saved up his assets but God suddenly took his soul so he could not get to enjoy his riches] For this reason I tell you, do not worry about your life, as to what you are to eat; nor for your body, as to what you are to wear. For life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing. Consider the ravens, that they neither sow nor reap; they have no storeroom nor barn, and yet God feeds them; how much more valuable you are than the birds! And which of you by worrying can add a day to his life’s span? Therefore if you cannot do even a very little thing, why do you worry about the other things? Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither labor nor spin; but I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these. Now if God so clothes the grass in the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, how much more will He clothe you? YOU OF LITTLE FAITH!!! Do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, and do not keep worrying. For all these things are what the nations of the world eagerly seek; and your Father knows that you need these things. But seek His kingdom, and these things [ie basic necessities] will be provided to you. Do not be afraid, little flock, because your Father has chosen to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves money belts that do not wear out, an inexhaustible TREASURE IN HEAVEN, where no thief comes near nor does a moth destroy. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” [endquote]      So base on the above two points (the second point is Jesus’ logic), it appears that the situation would not be absurd.

" _One can't instead appeal to some ""mere orthodoxy"" common to all Christians across confessional boundaries, at least not without stretching that ""mere"" to meaninglessness._      Orthodox Christians, (as well as Catholics), usually place great reliance on the teachings of the Fathers, especially they revere the early Fathers and the Greek Fathers, and they rely on the early Councils. A plausible case of departure from _orthodoxy_ on that basis can be made - by Catholics - against someone who (at least used to) comport himself as an Orthodox Christian. Rooney cites (a) an essay on the Eastern Patristic tradition on God's freedom, and eastern saints John Damascene, and Isaac of Nineveh.

"But I think in the finite case one can remove the counterintuitiveness. For there are mixed strategies that if adopted by everyone are better than everyone choosing _A_ or everyone choosing _B_. The mixed strategy will involve choosing some number 0 < _p_ best < _q_ (where _q_ is the threshold ratio at which the disaster happens) and everyone choosing _B_ with probability _p_ best and _A_ with probability 1 − _p_ best, where _p_ best is carefully optimized allow as many people to feed hungry children without a significant risk of disaster. The exact value of _p_ best will depend on the exact utilities involved, but will be close to _q_ if the number of agents is large, as long as the disaster doesn’t scale exponentially. Now our statistical reasoning shows that when your best estimate of the probability of other people choosing _B_ is _not_ close to the threshold ratio _q_ , you should just straight out choose _B_. And the worry I had is that everyone doing that results in the disaster. But it does not seem problematic that in a case where your data shows that people’s behavior is not close to optimal, i.e., their behavior propensities do not match _p_ best, you need to act in a way that doesn’t universalize very nicely. This is no more paradoxical than the fact that when there are criminals, we need to have a police force, even though ideally we wouldn’t have one.",think finite case one remove counterintuitiveness mixed strategy adopted everyone better everyone choosing everyone choosing b mixed strategy involve choosing number p best q q threshold ratio disaster happens everyone choosing b probability p best probability − p best p best carefully optimized allow many people feed hungry child without significant risk disaster exact value p best depend exact utility involved close q number agent large long disaster scale exponentially statistical reasoning show best estimate probability people choosing b close threshold ratio q straight choose b worry everyone result disaster seem problematic case data show behavior close optimal ie behavior propensity match p best need act way universalize nicely paradoxical fact criminal need police force even though ideally one,pruss,1387,1,2762

"WCB      And now, the proposition that God is outside of time. This propsition was posed by Augustine in his ""Confessions - Book XI.""   It became an idea adopted by most if not all classical theologians from Boethius to Aquinas.      For God, there is no real past, present, or future, to God all is Now. God can directly experience every part of that Big Now. Difficuly one is if there is no real past, there can be no before, now, afterwards. Creation entails before creation, creation, after creation.

There are also intermediate cases, such as fish, where it is not entirely clear what we should say. But what we don’t have is any basis for concluding that consciousness exists _all across_ nature, from human beings to ordinary inanimate objects to fundamental particles.

"Norm, I believe that a _stable_ civil society needs to have a fairly strong correlation in the belief of its people as to what is the end of the state and what is the end of religion. If the two ends are not strongly correlated, then eventually one will end up attacking the other as antithetical to its purpose.      And to a Christian, since our true and FINAL end is to reside in union with God in heaven (which we will only achieve in the next life), the ""end"" or telos of civil society can only EVER be expressed as a _qualified_ end, an ""end to the extent of this life"", not as a final and unqualified end. And while the civil society should not be _directly ruled by_ the Church, its activity needs to be _informed_ by the higher, more ultimate end that is man's true and final end, for the civil society's ends must be formed so as to cooperate toward the ultimate end of man, or there must be conflict between them. And conflict between them implies a NOT-stable condition.      While I have not yet read an integralist's vision of a sound state that I would affirm without reservation, I think that one of its underlying principles (as stated above) is pretty much irrefutable as a part of Catholic social teaching. What some integralists seem to forget is that subsidiarity, too, is a principle that is essential to Catholic social teaching.      As a matter of historical datum: while it is nice-sounding to uphold the theoretical ""right"" of (formerly Catholic) heretics to spout off on their beliefs in a Catholic state, it is typical to the point of near-universality that when they HAVE done so, they do it in ways that violate the rights of others, i.e. they violate the virtues associated with truthfulness. Just as one example (a trite one but easy to check), locate Protestants who cite the issue of ""Catholics worship Mary"" and try to find one who checks his confreres and says ""wait, guys, this is an old but false canard, Catholics don't really worship Mary, and here's why..."" You will find _any number_ of Protestant sources that repeat the canard, and will have trouble finding Protestants who admit that the claim is just wrong. Nearly all modern Prots who repeat this false claim do so because they heard it from some prior source, but the FIRST Prots who asserted it _did not have that excuse_ , they asserted it _without_ of justification for it, their inventing this was, simply, contrary to the virtues of truth (e.g., checking your facts, not fomenting false rumors, etc.) Not all errors of the first Protestants were as _obviously_ wrong, but there is a common theme that they DIDN'T check their ""facts"" carefully, and they usually DID mis-represent what Catholic teaching says. The Catholic integralist is essentially correct that even where states uphold the basic right to free speech, there are (speech) violations of others rights that CAN be constrained by law, and spouting false things CAN be a violation of others' rights.",norm believe stable civil society need fairly strong correlation belief people end state end religion two end strongly correlated eventually one end attacking antithetical purpose christian since true final end reside union god heaven achieve next life end telos civil society ever expressed qualified end end extent life final unqualified end civil society directly ruled church activity need informed higher ultimate end true final end civil end must formed cooperate toward ultimate end man must conflict conflict implies not-stable condition yet read vision sound state would affirm without reservation think one underlying principle stated pretty much irrefutable part catholic social teaching integralists seem forget subsidiarity principle essential catholic social teaching matter historical datum nice-sounding uphold theoretical right formerly catholic heretic spout belief catholic state typical point near-universality done way violate right others ie violate virtue associated truthfulness one example trite one easy check locate protestant cite issue catholic worship mary try find one check confrere say wait guy old false canard catholic really worship mary find number protestant source repeat canard trouble finding protestant admit claim wrong nearly modern prots repeat false claim heard prior source first prots asserted excuse asserted without justification inventing simply contrary virtue truth eg checking fact fomenting false rumor etc error first protestant obviously wrong common theme check fact carefully usually mis-represent catholic teaching say catholic integralist essentially correct even state uphold basic right free speech speech violation others right constrained law spouting false thing violation right,feser,2964,0,2775

"Wherein is your confidence grounded? Rather than (and prior to) ""immoral,"" it would seem to be utterly pointless (inconceivable in relation to causal finality) and incoherent, and as such metaphysically impossible, on the presupposition of a sound (essentialist) metaphysical understanding of good (as fulfillment) and evil (as privation).""      It's a necessary moral fact that I intuitively grasp. One that I am more certain of than a lot of ordinary facts. Asking for my ""warrant"" here would be like asking me how I can be so confident that contingent facts must have an explanation - I could give you arguments, but at the end of the day it is obvious to me and I am convinced I grasp its truth simply by understanding it.      It absolutely *is* a moral fact. The fact that you can explain it through finality and essences doesn't change it so, as I'm sure you know, so I don't know what exactly your point would be.      If you accept that it is impossible for God to do what I just said, then what's the difficulty in making a similar (prima facie) judgment about the evil in our world? I believe there may be good, morally intelligible reasons for God to not interfere with our rotten world, in this sense it is different from the pointless-torture world. But in the absence of those reasons, our world would be as impossible as the torture-world, given God's perfect nature. This is sufficient to get the problem of evil going: the proponent simply thinks that postulating the existence of those morally sufficient reasons is implausible or too much of a cost. It IS a cost, but the theist will presumably want to hold that it is offset by the positive case for God, such that it's a cost the theist is willing to pay.      ""...fine, that's a subjective report, but the post here addresses that problem; if it means ""there's a real problem here for which we have no adequate solution,"" then I think you're mistaken...""      Well, I believe my views of evil reflect objective reality. Again, I know it and I would bet my house on the idea that God, or anything that is metaphysically perfect or subsistent existence, cannot create a pointless- torture world. This is a subjective report on my part but is also what I think about objective reality. And just like I am willing to bet my house on God not being able to create a world of pointless torture, I would also be willing to bet my house that God cannot possibly do-nothing about an innocent person that is suffering horribly in this world (say, being burnt), unless there is a greater good to be gained by his non-interference (or a proportionate evil avoided by his non-interference).      For example, suppose the burning contributes to the victim's ultimate virtue and happiness in an eternal heaven by giving them fortitude or whatever, in a way that somehow outweighs the suffering the victim endured on earth. Some people would find this implausible, but this is just an illustration, so suppose it's the case. Suppose also that this is the only potential good to be gained from that burning. Then if that good did not exist, I insist that God could not permit that victim to be burned. God would have to interfere to prevent or stop the burning. A corollary is that if the burning happens, and someone finds it implausible that the burning contributes to the victim's ultimate virtue and happiness in heaven, then the burden constitutes evidence against God's existence, since God would not allow the burning unless the burning contributed to the victim's virtue and happiness in heaven.

"My recent article on [the error and condemnation of Pope Honorius](http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2022/10/the-error-and-condemnation- of-pope.html) has gotten a lot of feedback both here and at Twitter (much of the latter surprisingly civil and constructive for that venue). Because of the historical and theological complexities of the topic, several issues have arisen, but the main one I want to address here is the question of whether Honorius can plausibly be defended from the charge of heresy that the Sixth Ecumenical Council leveled against him. Keep in mind that what is at issue here is _not_ whether Honorius taught heresy while issuing a purported _ex cathedra_ definition. He was certainly not doing that, which is why the case of Honorius is irrelevant to whether popes are infallible when they _do_ teach _ex cathedra_ (which is all that the First Vatican Council taught in its decree on papal infallibility). What is at issue is whether Honorius taught heresy when _not_ speaking _ex cathedra_ – and, more generally, whether any pope could in principle do so.",recent article error condemnation pope honoriushttpedwardfeserblogspotcomthe-error-and-condemnation- of-popehtml gotten lot feedback twitter much latter surprisingly civil constructive venue historical theological complexity topic several issue arisen main one want address question whether honorius plausibly defended charge heresy sixth ecumenical council leveled keep mind issue whether honorius taught heresy issuing purported ex cathedra definition certainly case honorius irrelevant whether pope infallible teach ex cathedra first vatican council taught decree papal infallibility issue whether honorius taught heresy speaking ex cathedra – generally whether pope could principle,feser,1077,0,2785

"Dear @Michael and @Talmid      The point Michael made about sane mind is true. Because when you read all that deplorable doctrines (I am using doctrines for the other philosophical views like reductionism, buddhism, etc.) there's no way your mind not being affected. Not because they are too counterintuitive - even though that is true - but because of the derailment of reason and the bizarre (to say the least) conclusions.      When I found Ed's blog and learned a little bit more about act and potency (keep in mind that we don't have that in Brazil, at least I never found it anywhere through my youth or academic life) there is a certain beauty in the doctrine of Aristotle - not in the sense of ""wow, after all that bullsh*t I found across the internet like reductionism and etc. there is finally something sane"" - but most especially in the way that the doctrine fits with itself i.e in the way that is constructed (the careful appreciation of every matter and etc.). But most importantly that gave me hope. And that is something I can't forget. Because at least it seemed plausible at the time.      But I want to confess something. Even though I never was an atheist throughout my life, I never had strong reasons to believe in Our Father. That's no surprise that I became a skeptical pseudo-atheist through my 19's. In a sense, I think my skepticism is a disease that I can't get rid of and that grow to the point that made my life in the miserable condition that I am now. That's hard to say but I swear to God that that's true.      The one (and the only one to be honest) reason for all of that is the fact that I am afraid of believing some falsity and dying without knowing the truth. I know that sounds really dumb for a motive but on closer analysis, I'm pretty sure that 99% of atheists and co. minds work like that too. That's why I am that way. The origin of that was the fact that part of my family is ''Espirita'' (if you guys don't have that crap religion there is a mixture of cartesian res cogitans plus the movie ghost from Patrick Swayze) and for a long time I was surrounded by 'palatable' ideas like: ""after death, there is a soul in the same form as your body that will come out of it and live forever"". I know that sounds stupid but as a kid in my 14-15years, I thought that that was true. It 'tasted' good because, you know, nobody wants to die. But the point is my intellect was so suffocated by that that I truly believed that in some way I ""was a soul"".

"Dr. Feser,      This was my question, also. Given your response, I have to ask the following: How does the *real* possibility of God opting not to create make any sense given classical theism's core doctrines of divine immutability and simplicity? It seems these most fundamental commitments logically entail the necessity—in some sense—of creation.

"Wright is also selective in the way he cites the relevant authorities. For example, while he acknowledges that Chapman is on the side of those who judge Honorius to be guilty of teaching error, he makes Chapman’s position sound more tentative than it really is.  Wright claims, for example: “Chapman is the most hostile critic, and yet all that he can bring himself to say is that certain passages are ‘difficult to account for.’” As we’ve just seen, though, that is far from the truth. Again, in his book Chapman goes so far as to say that “unquestionably no Catholic has the right to deny that Honorius was a heretic”; and in his _Catholic Encyclopedia_ article on Honorius, he says that “it is clear that no Catholic has the right to defend Pope Honorius.  He was a heretic, not in intention, but in fact.” Oddly, Wright does not quote these (rather important) remarks when reporting on Chapman’s views.",wright also selective way cite relevant authority example acknowledges chapman side judge honorius guilty teaching error make position sound tentative really wright claim example “ chapman hostile critic yet bring say certain passage ‘ difficult account for ” seen though far truth book chapman go far say “ unquestionably catholic right deny honorius heretic ” catholic encyclopedia article honorius say “ it clear catholic right defend pope honorius heretic intention fact ” oddly wright quote rather important remark reporting view,feser,906,0,2790

"As I said what really guts me is the fear of dying or believing something that is false. I know I may sound like a hypocrite or a fool (because I never gave up my faith in God). But that's just how I feel. And I admit that I think that I am only that way not just because of the overwhelming OCD that keeps triggering that thought and fear of being wrong in my mind but because I am too stupid and dumb to get things right (I'm not ashamed of saying that because it is true). If you ask me why metaphysical ideas are not affected by empirical conclusions I don't know what to say because I am simply too illiterate to understand the 'why question' and the difference between the two in the first place (even though I read Ed's blog posts about that e.g that one about the philosophy of nature). And I am afraid that someday some ""discovery"" may overthrow all of this.      I know that by the way the empirical sciences are derived today i.e that mathematized and abstract way it has nothing to do with and can't even scratch the A-T Meta at all. But my fear is what if there's some change in the methods or what if some way they could someway turn the tables against us? I admit that is not very clear to me how Metaphysics is separated from empirical matters.      But I remember seeing videos on youtube where Ed explains his road from atheism to theism (i.e by the way of philosophical reason and a lot of time studying those matters) and I think to myself: ""look at the certain look in the eyes of this man and how he defends the arguments he exposes"". I know that for a philosopher a straight face and seriousness don't mean that the argument is, in fact, good, but for the average joe like me, the impressions mean a lot (especially from a guy that comes from the other team i.e the atheist side because there must be some serious argument that made him change his mind in the first place). I think that you guys may understand what I want to say now. At the end of the day, every man wishes to learn the truth and die with it.      I don't know what to say. At Ed's blog, I somehow feel at home - even though I feel a lot of shame and fear of people mocking me and not taking me seriously, for example - it's hard to talk about that at least for me. But I swear to God that that's how I feel and in some way, that's why I'm somehow tied to buddhism because it ''ties'' my intellect into it i.e ""what if that insane ideology is true at the end of the day?"" But the fact is still I'm too stupid and incapable of wrapping my head around it alone (keep in mind that I do not believe in buddhism, as I said, I'm just afraid of something bizarre as that is true).      So, @Michael and @Talmid - I don't even know how to ask it without sounding, even more, idiot but I need to - there is a way to know for certain that nothing that may come in the future or whatever may affect the doctrine of Act and Potency, Substance, etc.? There is something that might turn all of that wrong or its stands or falls without being affected ever by the outward disciplines of science?

"Hey Tony      I affirm that man's ultimate end which is God has to be co-related with societies ends, but I think it's prudent to pursue this end only in a way that invokes a generic sort of theism on a governmental level. I also don't see anyway in which this generic sort of theism can be enforced in the sense that people should be penalized if they don't affirm it. I think the only plausible or effective way for a state to affirm theism is only if at the grass roots level a religious upbringing is pursued such that the majority of the people are religious and traditional which in turn forces the politicians to pay due regard to that reality. The Politicians's paying due regard to that reality is the most that one can possibly achieve with respect to the state's recognition of the ultimate end      I also am skeptical of any claims to the effect of constraining speech on the account of its violating the truth.

"@UncommonDescent      "" Neurocentrism: ""you are your brain"".""      That reminds me of an e-mail I sent to Ed back in 2019 more or less - when I first discovered his wonderful blog and work ...back then I used the term neuroatheism - referring specifically to Sam Harris ''book'' labeled free will. But I liked your term neurocentrism and I will friendly steal that apt- term from you :)      ""Truth: we are hylemorphic compounds, body+soul inextricably linked""      One thing that I can't possibly understand about the ""science guys""/antirealists of a sort is the fact that they treat the human body as a ""separated thing"". I mean, they don't think that the human body is one and only one compound - in other words, they despise body essential unity. They treat the body as if it were the cells that are in some sense 'individuals' that we're 'co-opted' by natural selection to work together, so at the end of the day, our unity is (by applying a bunch of sophistry 'based on science') nothing but an accidental one. But this to me - even though they might think they're geniuses and we are just a bunch of idiots - seems schizophrenic at best.      I would love to talk about this specifically with Ed if someday we could arrange to do a Q&A or a video talking about A-T Meta - specifically to bring that content to Brazil in a special way. But, with my rudimentary way of thinking I would argue that our parts don't really pre-exist us in any relevant sense, they don't have any ontological independence apart from the whole, and that they have an inherent subservient nature to the body - so it doesn't really make any sense at all to treat them as separated things. You can talk about different body parts, but you can't say that they are arranged there in any way like a computer part.      And I don't think that there is any 'magical' argument of the sort like ""oh, but we do not even know or understand the nature of the universe/humans, etc.. so how can you know for sure that that is really true?"". I think that any magical or sophistry arguments like that can't work because there isn't any other way around the problem in the first place. Or the parts are independent of the whole or they're not - there is no turnaround from this.

"Son of Ya'Kov, Thanks for the encouragement. Yes, it's true that atheist polemicists portray God in over-the-top anthropomorphic terms. All we can do is point out their error.      While it's also true that Christians (including Catholics) sometimes also hold to ideas that, strictly speaking, do not tally with divine simplicity, they often hold ideas that are wrong in other areas too. They don't make the rules in the Church - as a rule. Outside religion, the same pertains in every field of knowledge, including philosophy; not everybody is right on everything. That's why we have a Church to guide us.      Apart from the Church, it is personality itself that saves the orientation towards God, even among the ignorant: It's not for nothing that God says ""I am the God of Abraham"", more often than He says ""I am that I am"". Surely God's interventions were meant to make him recognisable; we know at once that it's the God of Isaac, not of Mohammad, not Zeus, Huichilobos, Heaven, the Sun etc.      Even if not essentially required, God has always wanted humans to be in relation to Him (religion), and told us so.

"part 2   As far as I’m concerned, this is all mystical, pseudo-philosophical gibberish. None of these ‘explanations’ mean anything. What is an “eternal act,” or knowledge that doesn’t produce a “metaphysical change” in the knower, or something willed “from everlasting”? Yes, your idea of God is immune to most atheistic attacks, but in securing this victory, you basically hollow out the definition so much that not only is there no trace left of a loving Father we can have a personal relationship with (not such a serious problem for religions like Buddhism, but a massive blow for traditional Christianity), but ‘God,’ identified as nothing more than a string of abstract concepts, is (like all abstractions) absolutely bereft of any concrete reality independent of a thinking subject.   Third leading from my second issue is are you a Pantheist David? I have read both yours and Ed Fesers blog sites and I recall you saying “The accusation of pantheism troubles me not in the least… There are many ways in which I would proudly wear the title… I am quite happy to be accused of pantheism.”   So, unless you were being facetious, I don't see how that doesn't confirm his and his followers' beliefs about you. You've also said that ""Pantheism is a vague term."" Well, the simplest definition is God=World that's it, he is immutable, indifferent, formless and eternal. However, is it possible that the accusations of pantheism are actually misunderstood as Panentheism?   Put simply, a Panentheist (also known as also known as Monistic Monotheism), is the belief, similar to Pantheism, that the physical universe is joined to God, but stressing that God is greater than (rather than equivalent to) the universe. Thus, the one God is synonymous with the material universe and interpenetrates every part of nature (as in Pantheism), but timelessly extends beyond as well. This conception of God influenced New England Transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, and was popularized by Charles Hartshorne (1897 – 2000) in his development of process theology in the 20th Century. The Neoplatonism (which you declare yourself a follower of) of Plotinus (in which the world itself is a God) is to some extent panentheistic with polytheistic tendencies, and philosophical treatises have been written on it in the context of Hinduism for millennia (notably in the “Bhagavad Gita” and the “Shri Rudram”). For more details on Panentheism I have provided a video link below, feel free to watch it.

"Implying that a Pope can teach heresy when not speaking ex cathedra - simply because Vatican I defined that ex cathedra statements cannot be heretical - seems a classic logical flaw of making the conclusion broader than the premises.      The Seventh Oecumenical Council could not evaluate the writings of Pope Honorius as heretical, not only because they weren’t, but because there was no discussion of these writings. If it accepted the history that Honorius was a heretic, it got it wrong.      Vatican I, which left nothing to implication, explained how we ought to interpret its deliberations. Because it defined that all the Popes had “unfailing faith”, the expressions contained in the deliberations of the Seventh Oecumenical Council should be understood as the censure of the extremely negligent behaviour that it was; the term heretic was not as specific then as it later would be. The sense of Vatican I in defining Papal infallibility is obvious; it is prefaced with Christ’s prayer that Peter’s faith would not fail, not merely that he might speak infallibly one a century. Rather than put a strict modern theological understanding of the term heresy into the mouths of prelates in ancient times, we need to apply the modern Church understanding of the Papacy; there is no getting around this.      Whether or not one can be accused of being a heretic for “not resisting an error” and “not defending the truth, one is NOT a heretic because of those things; Pope Felix III, cited in the post, has just explained how to view quite possible uses (which do not convey the understanding of a heretical Pope as we discuss it) of the term heretic in his times!      The bottom line is that, even if “the Pope cannot be heretical when not speaking ex cathedra” were reduced to an opinion that is not probable, this would not translate into meaning the contrary opinion is probable.

"Dear Tony   You make some interesting points.      With regards to the examples you pose, I agree that in those situations there is a need to have kids, but I am not sure if ""social pressure"", as in actively discouraging something really works in those situations, what would be more effective is creating incentives, probably monetary one's or social benefits for having those kids which may make women more likely to have them.      As for the overall morality or immorality of it, it seems to me that there is a general presumption in favour of the notion that having lots of kids necessarily implies that a women cannot pursue a career, but I am not quite sure of it. It's subjective.   Even if a society is in dire straits, there doesn't seem to be reasons to keep women who are working but at the same time has 4-5 kids from participating in the workforce, if she is able to do so.      There could be a social preference to stay at home but this does not have to be done in a coercive way, bur rather create better incentives to stay at home and that might be more effective.      Yes, it's sad that motherhood is not valued properly at times and seems to have a low social status lots of times.      To me though it's not really about working for the sake of earning money or profit, but it's just that women also have creative and intellectual persuasions which they may want to pursue as a part of what makes them human beings , they also are directed towards motherhood qua female, and as far as possible I think it's better if those are harmonised",dear tony make interesting point regard example pose agree situation need kid sure social pressure actively discouraging something really work situation would effective creating incentive probably monetary social benefit kid may make woman likely overall morality immorality seems general presumption favour notion lot kid necessarily implies woman can not pursue career quite sure subjective even society dire strait seem reason keep woman working time - kid participating workforce able could social preference stay home done coercive way bur rather create better incentive stay home might effective yes sad motherhood valued properly time seems low social status lot time though really working sake earning money profit woman also creative intellectual persuasion may want pursue part make human being also directed towards motherhood qua female far possible think better harmonised,feser,1559,0,2824
"Norm and Tony,   I appreciate both of your very nuanced views of how society should arrange itself to bring about the full human flourishing of men and women in the workforce. Something that I've been thinking about is how the current societal situation that we find ourselves in is the result of World War II (in the U.S. anyway) and the need for women to enter the workforce then. Since that time, we haven't exited wartime conditions in the workforce, insofar as the men/women balance was concerned. While I don't have a problem with that, it is something that we as a society haven't really stopped to reflect on to determine how best we should move forward (as the wartime boom in the economy pushed people into consumerism, which tends to discourage critical thinking).      Additionally, I know that St. JP II has talked about the importance of governments establishing a family wage instead of a living wage, which would enable one member of a household to support an entire family, which encourages parental rights insofar as education, both secular and religious, is concerned. Such a wage would also reduce the burden on single-parent households, as, with only one parent working at a time, the normal cost of items at an economic level would be reduced to accommodate the reduced demand, at least for a time. The question, of course, is, as you both have raised, is that if roughly half of the workforce should exit the workforce, which half should it be? Should only women be expected not to work in the private or public sectors anymore, or should it be more egalitarian? Regardless of which option is chosen, I believe that it is something that we should try to enact in the U.S. soon, as I remember reading a study (or at least the published results of a study) that said that raising children, which women still tend to in a dynamic of both parents working, was in an of itself a full-time job. This means that women are now expected to essentially work two full-time jobs in order to support and care for the family. While some of the could certainly be alleviated by greater husband involvement, I'm not so sure if that alone would solve the problem.",norm tony appreciate nuanced view society arrange bring full human flourishing men woman workforce something thinking current societal situation find result world war ii u anyway need woman enter workforce since time exited wartime condition workforce insofar menwomen balance concerned problem something society really stopped reflect determine best move forward wartime boom economy pushed people consumerism tends discourage critical thinking additionally know st jp ii talked importance government establishing family wage instead living wage would enable one member household support entire family encourages parental right insofar education secular religious concerned wage would also reduce burden single-parent household one parent working time normal cost item economic level would reduced accommodate reduced demand least time question course raised roughly half workforce exit workforce half woman expected work private public sector anymore egalitarian regardless option chosen believe something try enact u soon remember reading study least published result study said raising child woman still tend dynamic parent working full-time job mean woman expected essentially work two full-time job order support care family could certainly alleviated greater husband involvement sure alone would solve problem,feser,2169,0,2825

"Dear Tony      Thank You for your insightful reply.      Yes ! I more or less agree with your analysis.      I fully agree that there are professions, probably one's which involve a greater degree of physical aptitude that are better suited for men then women.      There may be some professions where even psychologically speaking men are more suited fo the job, example prison wardens.      And obviously temperamentally speaking women might veer more towards one profession then the other eg Humanities, so it isn't right to attribute all disparities in sex ratios to sexism per say or to undertake some massive campaign to equalise ratios.      My point is, more broadly speaking, that women should have at the very least the opportunity to pursue professions without it being pitted against her motherhood especially in professions which involve more intellectual endeavors rather then physical, generally speaking most professions are in that mould and even then I am not denying differences in aptitude with regards to these intellectual professions although the differences tend to be fairly neglible. What's important is the opportunity. And what's even more important is that the very idea of them participating in some profession shouldn't be seen as anathema.

Ihave posted on that several times here and go no real answer.      The Bible asserts God foreknows the future. Isaiah 41, 43, 46 etc.   God creates all.      If so, God must choose an initial state of the Universe he will create. From whatever state God chooses, God knows what will happen in that Universe. No sentient being in that Universes has free will.      Now, God having foreknowledge of the future as we are told, will know 13.75 years ago this Universe will have evil mongols, Nazis, Fascists, and Communists. A trillion years ago, God knew in the future he would creat a Universe, and what initial states of creation he would choose.      We are told dogmatically God is infinitely eternal. So from any point in the past no matter how distant, God knew when he would create a Universe, what initial state of creation God would choose, and the future existence of Mongols, Nazis et al.

"The Monothelite heresy arose as a sequel to the Monophysite heresy. Orthodox Christology holds that Christ is one Person with two natures, divine and human. Monophysitism holds that Christ has only _one_ nature, the divine one. Monothelitism can be understood as an attempt to find a middle ground position between Monophysitism and orthodoxy. It holds that while there are two natures in Christ, there is only one _will_. From the point of view of orthodoxy, this is unacceptable, for one’s will is an integral part of one’s nature. Hence to deny the reality of two wills in Christ is implicitly to deny that he has two natures. (I’m aware that the dispute over these heresies is more complicated than this quick summary lets on.

IOW, ""formal principles of reasoning"" are based on materialistic processes that even a simple computer can execute.         One cannot talk about materialism without a super-naturalism making its metaphysical entrance. It needs a dichotomy to be meaningful.      Merriam-Webster defines materialism as: ""a theory that physical matter is the only or fundamental reality and that all being and processes and phenomena can be explained as manifestations or results of matter."" I don't need to prove that this is metaphysically true to use it as a basis for understanding chemistry. But I can still use it as a tool for that understanding, even while formally unproven.

"(Continuation)      Based on what I've learned from Ed I've tried to fight against that fear of that undesired metaphysics. But my OCD won't let me. The more I've tried to fight and understand things the more they stuck in my head. I could notice btw a lot of gaps and things that I think were wrong with that nefast metaphysics - but I'm incapable to fight on my own and understanding things (you know, philosophy is hard. The fear of misinterpreting them due to a possible fallacy by my part or that they got some ""magic argument"" that I don't know and could just flip my refutation, etc. ).      I tried to engage against those arguments from impermanence, they're ontology and etc. by applying the methods of retorsion that Ed taught in the first chapter of Scholastic's Meta. There are a lot of similarities or so I think between Heraclitus and the Buddhists - after all, they both can't live for more than a second. But due to all my trauma and the fact that I felt so uncomfortable just by reading and thinking about it (my symptoms goes from headache, sleepiness, and weakness to fever). And all the other things like ""what if they have some argument that I don't know that could prove that I'm wrong'', ""what if I'm reading them wrong"" (even though I thought I'm somehow not), ""what if they have some way to turn around that argument from Aristotle in some way"" and all that stuff. But by now the more I try to confront this I'm simply mentally incapable and it's been almost 3 years of living that way. I don't have much more forces. My only hope is that someday some professional philosopher as formidable, careful, and badass as Ed could discuss this thing pointing out not just how it's wrong but that it can't even be right, to begin with, so I can finally put all that pain to rest. Because I'm simply incapable to tackle it by myself.      So, in all of this, I thank you guys, especially you @Michael, and My fellow countryman @Talmid.

"Tom,   ""is radiated into space which is how space is a resistive medium""   Ordinary object do radiate energy, true, but that does not make space a medium that is resistive to motion, nor does the radiation of energy by objects mean there is a net loss of energy, there isn't. Matter/energy are conserved.      Air, for example, seems to be a resistive medium, commonly called air resistance. An object in motion does indeed lose energy to the air as it moves through the air, and from the direct human senses that energy appears to be lost.      Such apparent losses are all around us. Roll a ball and of course, it will slow and stop and its energy of motion appears to have been lost. But that appearance turns out to be wrong. In fact the energy of motion of the object was merely transferred to increased energy of motion of the molecules that air is composed of.      ""You take a position that amounts to ""nothing is lost"" which is, effectively, that ""everything is one thing"", an absurdity.""   Everything is part of just one system, the cosmos as a whole. There is no necessity for a first mover to account for the observed motions within the cosmos because the causes of these myriad motions are the mutual and net lossless interactions of everything already moving in the cosmos.      ""You claimed that Aristotle thought that a force applied to an object forever would cause it to move infinitely fast, but this is correct. You have repeatedly ignored this consequence of relativity,""   According to relativity c, the speed of light in a vacuum, is an absolute speed limit. Thus far, all experiments performed confirm this.      Acceleration is a process of applying a force over time. In particle accelerators force is applied to particles over time to accelerate them. It has been confirmed experimentally that the more a particle is accelerated the more its speed asymptotically approaches c, but the energy of that acceleration is not lost, rather, the mass of the particle increases.      So, I suggest you do a little more research on the subject of accelerating beyond c, and you will find you need to modify your views on this subject with respect to the predictions of relativity you state above.      ""I still want to know what your purpose is in what is clearly just another boring attack on the Catholic Church.""   I am not interested in assertions of personal motives. I am interested in logical arguments and independently verifiable facts. Assertions of personal motives are unverifiable, but you asked, so I will tell you for whatever it might be worth to you, perhaps nothing at all.

Well he was all wrong about Christianity, plain and simple, for 32 years, which is why he didn't become one earlier.

"Tony, if I understand your post, I agree with most of what you say in it. Thanks to Dr. Feser, I know what an order is in Wullner's sense of that word. But I doubt that sanctifying grace makes a non-Catholic a member of the Church.      I doubt that Pope Pius XII and Msgr. Joseph Clifford Fenton tell us the difference between being a member of the Church and being in the Church as a nonmember of it.      Pius XII and Fenton say that only Catholics are members of the Church since each member of it must meet four requirements. He must wear the baptismal mark on his soul, profess Catholicism, be willing to submit to the pope and to the Church's other legitimate hierarchy, and not be under full excommunication. By those standards, a Protestant in sanctifying grace is in the Church as a nonmember of it.      But the dogma that there's salvation in only the Catholic Church is still true because people can be in the Church as nonmembers of it.      See Mystici Corporis Christi and Msgr. Joseph Clifford Fenton's book ""The Catholic Church and Salvation.""      A non-Catholic is in the Church if there's sanctifying grace in his soul. So he'll die in her if he's in that grace when he does. But his sect doesn't get him to heaven. If he reaches it, he does that despite that sect, not because of it.      That's why Blessed Pope Pius IX writes:   ""Our Predecessor, Gregory XVI, an “insanity,”2 viz., that “liberty of conscience and worship is each man’s personal right, which ought to be legally proclaimed and asserted in every rightly constituted society; and that a right resides in the citizens to an absolute liberty, which should be restrained by no authority whether ecclesiastical or civil, whereby they may be able openly and publicly to manifest and declare any of their ideas whatever, either by word of mouth, by the press, or in any other way.” But, while they rashly affirm this, they do not think and consider that they are preaching “liberty of perdition;”3 and that “if human arguments are always allowed free room for discussion, there will never be wanting men who will dare to resist truth, and to trust in the flowing speech of human wisdom; whereas we know, from the very teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ, how carefully Christian faith and wisdom should avoid this most injurious babbling.”4""      From what you're telling me, I must have misinterpreted John Paul's quotation from Redemptor Hominis. But his Assisi meetings and Vatican II's religious liberty may make some non-Catholics likely to die outside the Church.

"@Tony      It should be mentioned that the quote on the understanding to be given to the term 'proselytism' when it appears in Church documents, taken from a 2007 CDF document under Benedict XVI ('Doctrinal Note on some Aspects of Evangelization'), is a footnote (49) from a text whose main body is entirely devoted to the legitimacy of sharing one's faith.      Even in ordinary language, the term 'proselytism' does have a vaguely negative connotation these days, so it is fair enough that the Church has chosen to deploy it to denote negative ways of promoting the faith, while giving this clarifying definition in the 2007 document.      The same magisterial document explains: ‘Everywhere and always, each Catholic has the right and the duty to give the witness and the full proclamation of his faith. With non-Catholic Christians, Catholics must enter into a respectful dialogue of charity and truth, a dialogue which is not only an exchange of ideas, but also of gifts, in order that the fullness of the means of salvation can be offered to one’s partners in dialogue. In this way, they are led to an ever deeper conversion to Christ…The work of ecumenism does not remove the right or take away the responsibility of proclaiming in fullness the Catholic faith to other Christians, who freely wish to receive it.’ (12)      ‘…Love and witnessing to the truth are aimed above all at convincing others through the power of the word of God.

"UncommonDescent,      I've been in and out of here for many years. I've seen the ""reasoned"" argument in many variations. The variations all rest on something that can never be proven either directly or indirectly, and they usually demand acceptance of a proposition that's either highly questionable or downright false. We will disagree on what is necessary to claim knowledge. I look at the epistemology of the followers here and all I see are assertions masked as reasoning, dead- ends, and failures. I look at an epistemology that depends only on the material world and I see great successes. It's easy for me to choose which is best.      ""If our minds were wholly material, we could never attain knowledge"" -- That's an assertion. It's impossible to prove that.      ""Materialism can not explain the unity of the intellect"" -- There is a difference between ""materialism can never explain the unity of the intellect"" and ""materialism has not yet explained the unity of the intellect."" Your problem is that it's impossible to prove the former while it is possible to prove the later. Your philosophy is a defeatist philosophy. It builds failure into its ideology. You assume there is no answer therefore you stop looking.      ""nor can it explain the levels of abstraction that the human mind can attain, which are the basis of scientific knowledge.""      Abstraction is not a problem. Computers already perform forms of abstraction. Maybe you mean ""understanding abstractions."" What will you say when computers do understand abstractions? But even more to the point, how does your immaterial ""soul"" understand abstractions? This is another thing that's impossible to explain and I don't recall anyone on your side even trying. Your attempt at that is inept. You're not even trying. ""Apprehension of the substantial form"" is just a redefinition. ""Apprehension of what underlies them, what's beneath them"" is not a how. You're merely re-framing the issue. ""The knowledge of the true nature or essence of things is the province of the human soul"" is pure assertion and has nothing to do with a how.      ""And yet, only one species among the billions that Evolution has spawned can understand the meaning of 'Evolution'.""      It only takes one. You have no point here. Humans cannot fly. It does not follow that therefore evolution is incapable of producing animals that fly. It's irrelevant that we happen to be the smartest of animals. Some animals do understand things. One only has to play ball with a dog to realize that. Monkeys are smarter than dogs.

"Hi Tim and Talmid,      Thank you for your comments. It seems to me that they cancel each other out. Tim insists that dualism is the default position that humans gravitate towards from childhood, while Talmid makes the following admission concerning the way people think about God: ""most people do assume He has a body because they just do not have the necessary training a philosopher has(or should have) to be capable of understanding what being immaterial means."" That suggests that the default position is some kind of subtle materialism. Well, which is it: dualism or materialism?      Most people picture themselves still being able to see and hear after they die, and that many NDE experiencers report the same. (Likewise, Jesus' parable of Dives and Lazarus in Luke describes Dives as being able to see Lazarus and hear Abraham.) Some NDE survivors even report seeing God. Of course, I don't for a minute claim that this proves God is corporeal: rather, I assume God is able to appear to us in whatever form He wishes.      That said, I do think Tim is correct when he writes that many people naively tend to think of themselves as a mind inhabiting a body. However, I don't think people believe that the mind of a deceased person is utterly disembodied: rather, they tend to picture it as having a subtle embodiment, like a shade or ghost. The Biblical story of Saul and the witch of Endor fits this tradition.      Finally, I am not claiming that the Bible has to be interpreted as TEACHING a bodily God. Rather, I think there's overwhelming evidence that that's what the authors of both the Old and New Testaments, as well as the Christians of the first two centuries, actually believed. They didn't feel any need to teach it: to them, it was obvious.      Ironically, the most significant evidence for this point comes from Augustine himself. (See Paulsen's essay, pages 74-76.) Despite growing up with a Christian mother (Monica), he was under the sincere impression that Christians believed in a corporeal God with a human form, until an encounter with the cultured Christian bishop Ambrose (a huge fan of Platonism, whose sermons contained many phrases from Plotinus) led to his conversion in 386, at the age of 32. By then, the Roman empire was mostly Christian. Augustine would have met and conversed with Christians every day. How could he have been so profoundly mistaken for 32 years if (as readers on this thread claim) the standard teaching of the Church at that time was that God is immaterial? Back then, it wasn't. That came later.

That may be the position of some, but it is not my position and it is not a necessary conclusion. This article begins with the most common mistake theists make. They turn indifference into a necessarily positive statement. It's true I do not believe in the supernatural. But it does not follow that I argue there cannot be a supernatural. I simply argue, it makes no difference. It can never be proven. It's not a credible factor in my life. It cannot be relied upon for any effect in the natural world, the world in which we live.

My only care is when people use it as an unassailable political ideology which, unfortunately, is almost always the underlying motive.

"(continuation)      But the more I grew up, the more I saw how bullshit and make-believe that idea was. That's why I was very (and still am in some way) very afraid to believe or take something for granted. I don't want to believe in something because of how it tastes (i.e good or desirable), but because that's the truth. That's why I (wrongly as I can see now) take the road of ""naturalism"". Not only because of the overwhelming appeal that has today but because it was ""science"" and ""science is the truth"" and ""science is the only thing you can trust that is rational"" because ""it is founded on empirical data"" [I can go on ad nauseam but I will stop here]. But the problem is that at the time I didn't knew that ""science"" was so problematic and not that all-powerful being that is painted today, and full of theories and all that dogma behind it - I simply took it for granted like the average XXI century atheist.      But the problem with skepticism though is the fact that you never get anywhere with it - and in fact, it seems more reasonable to ""believe"" in absurdities that defy reality than something that sounds plausible or good at all. That's why I'm afraid of ""taking sides"". I must say the theory of act and potency, substantial form, the doctrine of the four causes is the most beautiful (and it sounds a lot saner than the rest of the competition out there) that I found since then. And I do believe that when I am reading it that it tends to reflect the truth. It's so good to be true. It reflects a God as the cause of the world and even grants our status as real beings.      But the problem with me, I'm afraid, is having the same 'faith' I had in the 'espirita' way (i.e the fact that being desirable and all of that) in the same sense with the A-T Meta. I know it sounds ridiculous to compare that crap doctrine of espiritismo with the A-T Meta (and I AM NOT DOING SO).

"End quote. Note that Hart takes what amounts to a compatibilist view of divine freedom. That is to say, he claims that God’s being free is compatible with his being unable not to create the world. Now, as Rooney says, this contradicts Christian orthodoxy. To be sure, the tradition affirms that God is unable positively to will _evil_ , specifically, and that the ability to do so would indeed be a defect in his freedom. But it also insists that he was nevertheless able not to create this particular world, or indeed any world at all. For Christian orthodoxy, the claim is not (contra Hart) merely that the world could have failed to exist.  It is that God could have refrained from bringing it into being. It is a claim not merely about the nature of the _creation_ , but also about the nature of the _creator_.",end quote note hart take amount compatibilist view divine freedom say claim free compatible unable create world rooney say contradicts christian orthodoxy sure tradition affirms god unable positively evil specifically ability would indeed defect freedom also insists nevertheless able create particular world indeed world christian orthodoxy claim contra hart merely world could failed exist god could refrained bringing claim merely nature creation also nature creator,feser,814,0,2895
"@ Tim Finlay,      ""[...] sleep furiously""      Very good indeed. Thus perhaps Chomsky's reputation among some as ""the father of modern linguistics"" is ill deserved except as just another example of modernity being ""the mother of all confusion"". Chomsky's understanding of language seems to be quite limited although couched misleadingly in sophisticated mathematics.      So much, then, as well for the importance of the idea that all truth can be expressed mathematically. Perhaps it can, but perhaps all falsity can also be so expressed. But then how would mathematics illuminate the difference … as ""A is true and B is false"" and ""B is true and A is false"" are both expressions, but they cannot both be true? It seems that there must be something more fundamental than mathematics … even if it is a formalization of human reason.

"Dr. Ed Feser gives a brief rundown of the “error” and condemnation of Pope Honorius I (625-638). He draws mostly from the Patristic scholarship of great Fr. John Chapman who was a remarkable scholar on the early Papacy and the issues related to the Latin vs Byzantine Churches throughout the first seven ecumenical Councils. In my own research, I have come to think that Fr. Chapman’s is perhaps the best sketch and explanation of the events surrounding Honorius. There can be no question that Pope St. Leo II, the very Pope who confirmed the decrees of the Council of Constantinople III (681), that is, the very council which had accused Pope Honorius of heresy, believed that his predecessor Honorius had committed a heresy. There can be no question that, including Constantinople III, three more ecumenical synods repeated the anathema against Honorius for heresy. Moreover, in the Roman Breviary, up until the 18th century, included a description of Honorius as a “heretic” for June 28th, the feast of the Pope who executed Honorius’s condemnation (St. Leo II). There also can be no question that these Councils, Popes, theologians, canonists, and general Christian thinkers understood Honorius as a heretic. Though, you have some exceptions.      One thing that Feser does not venture deeply into is the question of what kind of “heretical crime” was proven at the Council in 681 over Honorius, a man who had died 42 years prior to its convocation. At best, Honorius can be convicted of material heresy since the form added to the matter of heresy has to be proven. Moreover, since the doctrine of two-wills in Christ was not definitively settled, even a material heresy in this regard (according to Catholicism’s developed canon law) could not, of itself, situate one into the canonical crime of heresy nor the status of mortal sin. Otherwise, we would have to anathematize the person and memory of St Thomas Aquinas for his rejection of the Immaculate Conception. But that is impossible since Pope Sixtus condemned anyone who would accuse another for mortal sin or canonical heresy when the matter had not yet been resolved by the Apostolic See. While the Council of Constantinople III cannot be said to have worked with these parameters, those parameters did become standard and acceptable to Catholic canon law, jurisprudence, and pastoral theory. It is practical today.      What lessons, asks Feser, can be drawn from Honorius for us today? I think the most that can be drawn is that a Pope can commit a doctrinal error. But that a Pope could become teach heresy and thereby become a formal heretic is not illustrated by the Honorius-event. One might argue that the Honorius-event lends great precedent that such a thing could, in theory, happen. But there is nothing in the Honorius-event, according to developed Catholic beliefs on the nature of heresy and its criminality, that illustrates that precedent. Now, if we revert back to the standards of the Latin and Greek policies during the 7th century, then it is a foregone conclusion, a Pope can become a formal heretic. But it seems to me that we cannot ignore the canonical, theological, and pastoral developments that have taken place since Honorius to the present day.      For a more relevant historical context wherein a Pope committed an error while in office, coupling form and matter (but perhaps not pertinacity), you would have to study the Three Chapters controversy under Emperor Justinian regarding the Constituta of Pope Vigilius.      PS. For the life of me, when I read Honorius’s letters, my own private judgment does not see him as a true Monothelite.

" _Walter, we have been well-prepared by three hundred years of conservative ascendancy since the triumph in the early eighteenth century of the society that would be defended by Burke and de Maistre._      Cervantes, could you, out of courtesy to present company (especially our host Dr. Feser), stop referring such bilge as the above as being accredited to ""conservatives"" simply, and use a more correct term, such as (to pick one among various options) ""Burkean conservatives"", or some other hyphenated- conservative slice that does not cover the entire gamut of conservatism?

Because your tendentious comments about ""conservatives"" **always** focuses attention on bad ideas from _CERTAIN BRANCHES_ of conservatives, but are not shared by other branches of conservatives and are not generic to conservatism as such. Conservatism includes some who reject exactly the errors you so deride. Henceforth, ongoing failure to **_qualify_** your comments in an appropriate way amounts to either straw man fallacies or simply boorish argumentation meant to score points rather than to elucidate truth.      In point of fact, no version of Burkean or Maistrean theory has held primary social or political control in the West for 300 years, and in reality the degeneracies present in the western society that we have exist _far more_ due to forces _opposed_ to Burkean theory than forces closely allied with his philosophy. (And no, I am no Burkean - the above is not meant to _defend_ his ideas.) Even granting the (arguable) thesis that Burke was a right-liberal while others were left-liberals, the left-liberals have been the ones with vastly more effective power than the right-liberals, in the West considered generally. It is ONLY by lumping Burke in with _all liberals_ that one can consider anything even related to his theory to have triumphed over a 300 year period, but to then go on and attribute this to ""conservatives"" is to simply push the term ""conservative"" beyond any meaningful sense whatsoever, and then your comment becomes mere noise.

Why does God exist in every possible world? He exists because He is, by definition, absolutely necessary. If He weren’t, then He could differ from world to world. But given His absolute necessity, there is no PW without God. There is thus no “collapse” of modality from world to world; He is always absolutely necessary. If God is omnipotent in World 1, He is omnipotent in World 2. God’s will is one with God’s power, so His will cannot vary from PW to PW. So, no collapse occurs.      Similarly, the modality of creation’s contingent status remains the same from PW to PW. Since it is always reliant on an extrinsic cause, it is impossible for its contingent modality to collapse into absolute necessity. To insist otherwise is to equivocate.

"Hello Vicente. Even if you don’t choose to write, nothing stops you from having a read. To repeat myself; the only things that matter concerning Church belief BC or AD are its official pronouncements. There is no disconnect between God as professed in the OT or after Christ. Nor is there any God of classical theism; non-Catholic philosophers (all of them) had insights, but also fundamental errors concerning God. Catholic philosophers like St. Thomas Aquinas professed the same God in the same manner as the OT and the Christians of the first century.      You’ll find that the Church’s official pronouncements are quite in line with popular piety because the Church invented it and guided it, along with the liturgy. Catholicism is not a folk religion, or a pseudo-democracy, or an aristocracy (we’ll leave such non-traditional heresies for the Kwasnewsky Neo- Old Catholics).      Those who can’t get over figurative language in the Bible about God “seeing” etc., need to have a look inside any Catholic Church in the world. These places are full of, not just references to God hearing, speaking, and seeing, but images of His eyes, ears and mouth. We (and the OT) have always understood these things to be figurative. There is no way humans can talk or think about God without figurism; even the Jews, Muslims, and extreme Protestants venerate inscribed words (the same thing). Even our concepts rely on figurism to exist, which does not make them any less true.      The ”scholars” you mention fail to establish their theory and the proofs you’ve mentioned don’t fit the bill. You stated earlier on that “Clement of Alexandria, Irenaeus… and possibly Athenagoras” affirmed that God is corporeal. Where?

I misunderstood your intentions: you want custom scoring rules for a particular P; I thought you were looking for general scoring rules that could be used for any P.   For example, if you want to evaluate your weatherman, you probably want to evaluate his ability on all kinds of weather not just e.g. snow.      Also, you seem to want to derive scoring rules from a RV V dependent on the event P.   The scheme is:   1\. estimate x as Pr(P);   2\. use estimate x to calculate the optimal strategy;   3\. use the actual payoff V as the score.

I honestly don't have a mission against Prof.Feser, I mean if I did, I wouldn't post on the blog in the first place, nor would I have complemented this post as informative if you look to my very first post.

But in that entire first post if you look at it, there wasn't any reference to Prof but only my take on faith and punishment.      In the second post where I did mention Prof Feser by name (negative, critical), I also mentioned ""justifiably"" and ""understandably"". I even mentioned justifiably so as to suggest that the frustration and overall bleak outlook on this papacy can indeed be justified. And can even be the subject of an interesting and wholesome exchange like the one we had now. Even I become negative and critical from time to time. It isn't really wrong to be so. Again I admit the word ""bitter"" was a bit of an overstatement. I think what I was going for was is, ""exasperated"" with this papacy.      And the overall context of that second post was to point to a hypothetical scenario where a Pope who was orthodox in every except the death penalty and ponder on what would be or should be our reactions. I indicated that Prof's reaction would be more or less similar to what it is now however you may classify it.

"Norm, I agree with almost everything you have said here. In particular, I think it would be - mostly - better to have social _incentives_ for the desirable actions, than to rely on coercive measures. But the reality is that social incentives and social DISincentives always co-populate an arena, and **only SOME social disincentives are coercive**. There are vast swathes of social interaction where I choose not to do an action (that is socially undesired) because if do it I will be snubbed, I will be sneered at and considered a boor, a jerk, etc. That's not coercive, but it is an _effective_ social disincentive.      _There could be a social preference to stay at home but this does not have to be done in a coercive way, bur rather create better incentives to stay at home and that might be more effective._      The problem is this: infants and toddlers and pre-schoolers need, absolutely _need_ , some single person who is their main caretaker, (not a team), a someone whose top obligation, during those years, is to see to their care minute by minute, hour by hour. Someone whose other jobs _take second fiddle_ to those of being the caretaker, so that when the infant needs them RIGHT NOW, they can darn well give them attention right now, not in half an hour when the client is gone. In principle that person could be either the mother or the father, but any OTHER choice (e.g. aunt, grandfather, friend, neighbor, day care center, etc) will _always_ be only a second choice that is fitting ONLY because the first choices of mother or father are not possible. Social disincentives that directly speak to that truth, i.e. that SAY things like ""you know, you're putting the kid in day care because you want to pursue a career means the kid will lack valuable benefits"", while not being coercive _as such_ , will be felt as oppressive to the parent who doesn't WANT to acknowledge the truth of it, and who _wants_ a career that is well separated from hour-by-hour care of infants. In those situations where the parent's career provides total benefits _to the whole family_ (including the kid) which significantly outweigh the detriment to the kid, the parent may well be right to pursue the career, but they should be making that judgment **in light of clear understanding of the detriment the kid will suffer by not having a parent as the main caregiver.      It is a result of biology that infants need a breast to nurse at and that young infants need that too often to allow the mother to fit it ""in between"" the tasks of a regular day job. It is also a result of biology that a nursing mother receives hormonal rewards that enhance her bond with the baby, which also make it easier emotionally for her to handle the small daily trials of caregiving than would be the case for a stranger. It is a result of psychology that children need siblings not vastly divided in age. And thus it is a result of human nature that a normal family will have its children in a concentrated clump of the kids a couple years apart, not stretched out one every 6 years. Given these facts, it is driven by human nature that _mothers_ , specifically, will usually be the best infant and toddler caregiver, all other things being equal. Yes, there are individual circumstances that dictate departing from this norm (e.g. post-partum depression could force a change), but it's still **_a true norm_** of family life. The fact that we can, when necessary, make other provisions, doesn't disprove it as a norm. **",norm agree almost everything said particular think would - mostly - better social incentive desirable action rely coercive measure reality social incentive social disincentive always co-populate arena social disincentive coercive vast swathe social interaction choose action socially undesired snubbed sneered considered boor jerk etc coercive effective social disincentive could social preference stay home done coercive way bur rather create better incentive stay home might effective problem infant toddler pre-schoolers need absolutely need single person main caretaker team someone whose top obligation year see care minute minute hour hour someone whose job take second fiddle caretaker infant need right darn well give attention right half hour client gone principle person could either mother father choice eg aunt grandfather friend neighbor day care center etc always second choice fitting first choice mother father possible social disincentive directly speak truth ie say thing like know putting kid day care want pursue career mean kid lack valuable benefit coercive felt oppressive parent want acknowledge truth want career well separated hour-by-hour care infant situation career provides total benefit whole family including kid significantly outweigh detriment kid parent may well right pursue career making judgment light clear understanding detriment kid suffer parent main caregiver result biology infant need breast nurse young infant need often allow mother fit task regular day job also result biology nursing mother receives hormonal reward enhance bond baby also make easier emotionally handle small daily trial caregiving would case stranger result psychology child need sibling vastly divided age thus result human nature normal family child concentrated clump kid couple year apart stretched one every year given fact driven human nature mother specifically usually best infant toddler caregiver thing equal yes individual circumstance dictate departing norm eg post-partum depression could force change still true norm family life fact necessary make provision disprove norm,feser,3501,0,2937
"Hey, Uncommon.      If you have some time, check this (https://naturalhistory.si.edu/education/teaching-resources/life- science/early-life-earth-animal-origins). Now, this is an example of what I have been trying to say.      Leaving aside the fact that the text tried to implicitly assert the plausibility of the mitochondria theory as a 'known fact' or true without arguing - when it's in fact just a theory among others. Look what they say about animals - especially multicellular ones. And besides the fact of the 'magical' conjoining of diverse cells or microorganisms inside microorganisms, they are doing exactly as I said in the example.      As I said, this sounds insane. But based on your comments and @Tom Cohoe - and some things I read of Ed's work - I think we can say something about this. First, even though this is all true and or cells and etc. we're co-opted by 'who knows why' to work together, the history is very different now than it was long ago. Our ACTUAL existence is not like it was long ago. They say in the text that the microorganisms that formed the mitochondria were separable in principle - at least they suppose it is that way. In our actual existence, we can't separate our parts and expect them to work ALONE or in the same way, as it was long ago (again, supposing that they were right) because they are organs - parts of substances - not substances in their own right.      But one of the major problems I think that all of this has (and I'm basing myself on somewhat the same analysis that Ed does when discussing atomism in his Scholastic Metaphysics book) is when it comes to the first organism because the first organism on earth necessarily had parts that work together - and work for him. So, even if they say that our unity is an accidental one (like atomists say), they can't get rid of substance (and prime matter) in the first place (like atomists).      What do you guys think?

It just doesn't seem right for a first Catholic missionary to inform the authorities of a state that they should allow missionaries to convert and at the same time accept that Catholic countries won't allow conversions in their regions   because Catholicism is the truth.      While ofcourse it's the Truth, it also requires detailed argumentation and convincing for people to see that Truth. I would say most of the time it isn't even argumentation but just the experience of God's work through some profound life changing event which borders on being a miracle that ultimately causes people to convert, eg being cured, making up with your estranged family etc.      One might argue that this truth isn't as obvious as other truths and requires a good degree of commitment. It also means that reasonable people might ultimately not come to see that Truth.      Hence it makes sense for me for states to not be specifically religious especially in regards to matters of preaching and conversion, it should be neutral in that regard.

"@WCB      Interesting. I imagined that the number of theists there would be a bit lower.      And yea, a lot of non-religious theists would probably not have a well defined concept of God. I know that my younger self did not.      @Multiverse Anon      That is actually a very good reply. Sounds like Spinoza take on creation.      I guess that one dificult would be that this leads to there being no contigent truths, the classical bullet Spinoza bited, for them the FC can't not create the multiverse.      Another dificult would be with the multiverse part. For instance, if all possibilities are true them there probably would exist a universe were there is a galaxy or a solar system exactly like our owns but with nothing else,, it just happened that, say, a solar system exactly like our own exists there alone and that is it. But we live in a universe where there is way more, so we observing so much seems improbable if a multiverse exists.

"Vincent, I fear your new theory is just the same as the Aristotelian thesis but in different words. You still have levels of being and now some actualities are grounded in other “actualities.” Form is the source of a things defined properties, matter is the source of its ability to have other properties. If you scrap matter for just another kind of form then you have a Parmenedian static universe. If this conclusion doesn’t follow from your new conception of “levels of actuality” then you’re really just describing potency.      Potency is not mysterious, it’s almost the exact same meaning as when average men say something has “potential.” And I highly disagree that essence and existence are artificial.      The ancients like Plato and Aristotle were much better at being in touch with intuitive knowledge and deepening their understanding of what is already implicit in our mind (I.e. growing of wisdom) rather than the contemporary philosophical practice of over-analyzing to the point of doubting the obvious. The contemporary philosopher is rigorously trained to over-analyze and cut himself off from the original source of information (e.g.Descartes, Kant, pansyschism, etc.), so I caution against the accusation that Plato, Aristotle, or Aquinas were mysterious or artificial in their thinking when it is probably us who are blind.

I wouldn't call these religious beliefs, they are normative moral beliefs based on embryology and sociology. And since I hold them to be true obviously I would seek to convince others as well. But obviously through the democratic process, if the majority of the people happen to disagree with me and vote accordingly, I will respect that outcome and perhaps adopt a more grass roots approach to change that out come through the democratic approach.

"@Walter writes:       _The point is that, apparently, unicorn do not fit into His will, so it is not possible for a world with unicorns to exist._      There is a difference between logical possibility and actual possibility. It is logically possible for me to jump to the moon, but it is actually impossible for me to do so. And it is impossible because my nature does not permit it. It is also logically possible for God to create a universe with unicorns, but it is actually impossible if God’s perfect will does not include it.       _Tyhe ""necessary condition"" I am atalking about is not just God, but God's will to create a world without unicorns., which is identical to God._      Well, if it’s identical with God, then it is just God.

If you define absolute necessity as independent necessity, then creation is not absolutely necessary, but I don't know anybody who would argue that if creation is necessary but dependent, there would be no modal collapse._      Your point is rather vague here. The word _contingent_ [means](javascript:void\(0\);): “dependent or conditioned by something else.” So, if creation is dependent on God, it is contingent by definition. We can say that creation is necessary on the supposition that God creates, but its necessity is always hypothetical and not in itself.      And as I’ve stated several times now, creation’s status is always derivative which makes its modality a conditional necessity. The fact that it exists in all PWs never collapses its conditional necessity into absolute necessity. Thus, modal collapse does not occur.      Opponents of DS have argued that the necessity of the universe forces its defenders to abandon divine liberty, for if the universe is necessary across every PW, then God is forced to create this universe. But as we’ve apparently agreed, this does not threaten divine liberty at all.

A big sign does not light up in the sky before all.      ""We"" choose as individuals to believe this, or its essential opposite, that.      Catholics (not all, of course) believe that enough sign is there to allow us to choose the essential truth without being so overwhelmed by some deductive system that faith is unnecessary (""faith is [...] the evidence of things not seen"" - Hebrews 11:1 KJV).      Aquinas had faith long before he wrote The Summa, so what he wrote must be seen in that light. He also wrote very early in the Summa that if we had nothing at all in common with those who oppose the faith, we could convince them of nothing, but knowing the truth ourselves, we could see how they were wrong because truth cannot oppose truth (in the sense of LNC).      So his First Way is ""natural theology"" as philosophy, but it is written that it will not conflict with his faith.      I was not overwhelmed by a deductive system at all. After 65 years of perplexity, I saw enough sign that I could choose (without ""seeing""). I chose to believe.

"Sorry, I thought I had logged in under my name. I was the Anon of 2:29 above.      _It is / uses a theory that starts from the notion of surplus value and the workers' creation of surplus value._      Since both capitalism and socialism agree that there is surplus value that arrives on account of labor's input, neither _the surplus_ nor that it comes from _labor_ can be used to distinguish between the two economic model groups. What distinguishes them is that the socialist model insists that the means of production must not be privately owned:      _a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole._      While it is facially possible to speculate on models that provide for instances where factories (and other means of production) are owned by lower- down entities than **the whole community** , there are two problems: (1) the fundamental criterion here is that _there is no choice_ about whether the property is owned by ""the community"", the state mandates it and enforces it. So, while some community other than ""the state"" may be the nominal owner, because the state sets all of the criteria of what constitutes a sufficiently non-private entity, the state necessarily is embroiled in controlling the conditions of ""ownership"" on a vastly more intrusive level than in private property. This takes many of the elements of the ""bundle of rights"" that constitute ownership and puts them into the state's hands. Nominal ownership and actual control are not the same.      (2) Nobody has successfully articulated an actually _workable_ plan by which ""the workers"" can exercise control over production without very heavy intrusion of state authority. Even the most optimistic of ideas - which have never actually been implemented in an actual state - effectively would entail government regulation of ""boards"" and ""committees"" and ""councils"". Stanford Encyclopedia's description:      _Finally, and crucially, economic coordination would be based on comprehensive participatory planning. This would involve a complex system of nested worker councils, consumer councils, and an Iteration Facilitation Board. Various rounds of deliberation within, and between, worker and consumer councils, facilitated by this board, would be undertaken until matches between supply and demands schedules are found—with recourse to voting procedures only when no full agreement exists but several promising arrangements arise._      Anybody who knows the least bit of the history of the National Labor Relations Board knows that anyone relying on the above description without imagining intense government intrusion is wearing rose-colored glasses.      Regardless, my essential point is that it in socialism it is NOT an option for ""the workers"" to decide to distribute the means of production that may be ""under their control"" to individuals, and this constitutes a very grave limitation on their ""control"", such that it severely constrains a claim that ""the state doesn't own the means of production"". Yes, as long as you understand all the qualifiers that make that less than _simply_ true. The further constraint on property that has the state determine what constitutes a sufficiently large-scale ""means of production"" to require it ceasing to be ownable by an individual or a small group of individuals, and the typical mechanisms by which the state wrests control away from said individuals, also constitute reservations on what is meant by saying the state ""does not own"" the property. Under socialism, whatever community ""owns"" the property is, ultimately, shored up under a system of state constraints on said property that limits their choices in very important ways.

"For Johannes --- my responses have been simply in response to the claim that certain passages *necessitate* communism/socialism or some sort of ownership- less society for *all* people at *all* times. I have also stated that scripture clearly teaches that we need to have charity and the notion that our physical possessions, wealth, etc are fleeting and ephemeral, bound to this life only. Wealth can be a great stumbling block. I have only reiterated what I think is the standard view of these passages.      Your patristic citations deal (as I read them) primarily with communal Christian living and I can agree with them without claiming (as the skeptic above seemed to claim) that they necessitate some sort of socialism or collectivism for *all* Christians at *all* times.      Also, there is a difference between (i) a group holding all its possessions in common and living communally vs (ii) selling everything and giving everything to the poor (which in turn makes one poor and dependent on others). I'm merely reacting (ii), that *all* people at *all* times are supposed to sell *all* things and give the money away. (A wooden village skeptic sort of assertion.) It is this latter situation that I describe as resulting in an absurdity.      If you want to aspire to be communal or socialist or not own anything, my response is ""go for it"". I think that voluntary socialism/communism on a small scale (like at the family level, or a small community level) might work. That aspiration, however noble it may be, does not strike me as binding on *all* people at *all* times, like a wooden village atheist reading of those passages charges.      My position is that there is a happy common-sense medium which I've tried to convey. And, once again, my comments are only and exclusively in response to the idea (which I've heard advanced by skeptics over the years) that we're *obligated* to be communists/socialists.

Why isn't it good enough? Why does it take the scientist's experiment to change us rather than relying on the immateriality to work its magic by itself._      Because as I have said earlier, knowledge about the world (for us) is mediated by matter (we are obviously not angelic creatures). We have to work, and work hard to get to the essence of things. That's why empirical science is so important. But ""important"" and ""only source of knowledge"" are not the same. That was the error of Hume and co.      _A filter may exclude important information, but it may also limit noise in the input._      The problem is that, according to materialism, we can not escape the filter. There's no vantage point from which to test what passes the filter vs. what is beyond it. Reality remains out of bonds and we have opened the doors to radical skepticism.      _In my philosophy, causation is not imposed by our neuronal tissue upon the world._      How can we know that causation is not an illusion (another one) foisted upon us by evolutionary processes?

"Yeah, I think I made a number of mistakes in my argument.      On consequentialism what is evaluated is the action, not the end of the action. So even if my winning has lower utility than your winning under similar circumstances, it does not follow that my trying to win has lower utility than my not trying to win. There are two possibilities, after all, assuming I try to win. Either I will succeed or I won't. If I won't succeed, then the harder I tried, the more enjoyable the victory for you, for your fans and for my fans. If I do succeed, the utility is lower than if I had tried and you nonetheless succeeded (I am assuming your victory has higher utility), but it may still be higher than had I failed to try (in which case very likely I would not have succeeded) because then there would have been general disappointment. So a case can be made that my trying to win is better than my not trying to win, even if other things being equal my winning is worse than your winning. And similar things seem to hold on expected utility versions.      Still, suppose that the utility of your winning is higher than of my winning, and I am about to win, but I have some subtle way of throwing the game so no one can tell, and everyone will enjoy the game pretty much as much. Then on externalist consequentialism I should throw the game in this way. Whether such a way of throwing the game is available depends on many factors: what the game is, who the audience are, what level one and one's opponent are. Still, there are probably a number of combinations where such throwing is available, and the slight loss in quality of play is outweighed by the benefits of your winning.",yeah think made number mistake argument consequentialism evaluated action end action even winning lower utility winning similar circumstance follow trying win lower utility trying win two possibility assuming try win either succeed succeed harder tried enjoyable victory fan fan succeed utility lower tried nonetheless succeeded assuming victory higher utility may still higher failed try case likely would succeeded would general disappointment case made trying win better trying win even thing equal winning worse winning similar thing seem hold expected utility version still suppose utility winning higher winning win subtle way throwing game one tell everyone enjoy game pretty much much externalist consequentialism throw game way whether way throwing game available depends many factor game audience level one opponent still probably number combination throwing available slight loss quality play outweighed benefit winning,pruss,1676,1,3001

" _I know that St. JP II has talked about the importance of governments establishing a family wage instead of a living wage, which would enable one member of a household to support an entire family, which encourages parental rights insofar as education, both secular and religious, is concerned._      Interestingly, one of the simplest ways of achieving a ""family wage"" is to **_NOT_** pay an ""equal wage for equal work"" across the board: A family wage- earner being paid more than a single person doing the same job. (This does not imply, by any means, paying men more and women less: if the family wage earner is a woman and the single person is a guy, both doing the same job, it means paying the woman more than the guy.)      One gospel basis for this would be to point to the parable of the workers and the vineyard owner: he paid the workers differently _per hour_ , by paying them all the same amounts even though it was for different amounts of work. As long as the worker getting the lesser amount agrees that his wage is suited to the work being done, he has no legitimate gripe if the owner pays another worker more for the same work. So, arguably, ""equal pay for equal work"" is NOT a basic principle of just labor theory, and may even make the ""family wage"" impossible to achieve.",know st jp ii talked importance government establishing family wage instead living wage would enable one member household support entire family encourages parental right insofar education secular religious concerned interestingly one simplest way achieving family wage pay equal wage equal work across board family wage- earner paid single person job imply mean paying men woman le family wage earner woman single person guy job mean paying woman guy one gospel basis would point parable worker vineyard owner paid worker differently per hour paying amount even though different amount work long worker getting lesser amount agrees wage suited work done legitimate gripe owner pay another worker work arguably equal pay equal work basic principle labor theory may even make family wage impossible achieve,feser,1293,0,3007

A minor point about this struck me yesterday. There is doubtless some _p_ ≠ 2 such that _G_ _m_ 1 _m_ 2/ _r_ _p_ would have fit the observational data _better_. For in general when you make sufficiently high precision measurements, you never find _exactly_ the correct value.

"@bmiller,      I have a Ph.D. in Classics and publish on ancient philosophy and rhetoric. I really have no clue about physics!      You are right, I have not proposed a methodology by which one might gain knowledge about God. It's not easy to know how to propose a methodology, since apologists for Christianity (I can't speak about apologists for Judaism or Islam or other religions) generally tell us both that God is ineffable and beyond our ken AND tell us many things about God.      The best I can do is to suppose that experiences given to a wide range of people, across cultures and spaces, that can't reasonably be accounted for by natural causes, would provide evidence that God exists. After all, if God moves events in time-bound history (whether or not the ""moving"" itself was effected in time), people in general should be able to perceive them as moved by God and by no other mover, if they are to conclude from said events that God exists. Maybe, if the generality of people were given the same exact presentation at the same time with the same content, of which no natural entities could reasonably be considered the cause ...      I guess I'm saying that to establish the existence of a singular entity, and not merely to argue that certain notions are mutually consistent, we need some event in time experienced by a wide swath of people, and verifiable. We have stories about such events ... e.g. Yahweh giving the covenant to all of Israel at Mt. Sinai, or the alleged events at Fatima ... but then, we are pushed back into evaluating historical sources.      God is supposed to be the omnipotent and omniscient one around here, not me. If God wants to convince the generality of people that He exists, He should be able to figure out a way.      My beef with analogical predication concerns even the Ways. St. Thomas insists that God is not a member of any genus. But for the First and Second Ways to go through, as far as I can see, the first unmoved mover and the first uncaused cause must be members of the genera, mover and cause. So not all that is true of the first mover (it's supreme in its genus) is true of God (in no genus). So the first mover is not God, because not all that is true of the one is true of the other.   Similar problems beset other Ways.      As for the premise, ""if it has a beginning, then it has a cause,"" it doesn't matter whether St. Thomas endorsed the KCA. I gave that only as an example of how we can find arguments for God employing premises, which we do not know are true.

"ficino,   Dr. Bonnette is declaring principles ad hoc, conflating existence with motion of an existent object, and then circularly employing his ad hoc assumptions.      Even Aristotle understood that motion would continue ad infinitum absent an impeding medium, and did not himself apply an act/pot analysis in the case of such unimpeded motion. This is a fact of history the A-T folks seem to be avoiding, either intentionally or out of mere lack of study.      Let's see what Aristotle had to say on this subject:   archive.org/stream/aristotle-physics-book-III-and-IV-clarendon/aristotle- physics-book-III-and-IV-clarendon_djvu.txt   CLARENDON ARISTOTLE SERIES   General Editors   J. L. ACKRILL and LINDSAY JUDSON   IV. 8 TRANSLATION 214 b   (4) Again, no one could say why something moved will come to rest somewhere; why should it do so here rather than there? Hence it will either remain at rest or must move   on to infinity unless something stronger hinders it.      So here we have Aristotle describing, essentially, inertial motion. Note, Aristotle makes no attempt to analyze such motion using potential versus actual positions, or anything of the sort, rather just the opposite.      Aristotle understood that once an object is moved it will move on to infinity unless something else hinders it.      Aristotle understood that motion from L to L1 is not the actualization of a potential that requires an external mover, rather, motion of a thing is a natural state of that thing, once moved, and that thing will remain in that state of motion unless ""something stronger hinders it"".      The error Aristotle made is in believing that sub-lunary motion is in an impeding medium such that the motion of a thing (or what we would call the kinetic energy, or a different parameter we would call the momentum), is lost. It is the perception of loss that was the key mistake.      Dr. Bonnette lacks the insight of Aristotle in analyzing motion absent a lossy impeding medium and has invented ad hoc a baseless and false principle that somehow requires a mover to keep it moving. Obviously, the opposite the case. It is the stopping of a moving object that requires an external mover, or as Aristotle correctly stated ""something stronger hinders it"".      Both Dr. Bonnette and Dr. Feser also, and similarly, have existential inertia completely backwards. An object in existence at T and then in existence at T1 has not changed in its aspect of existence, therefore, no changer is called for to account for existential inertia. Yet, Feser has repeatedly asserted just the opposite, that somehow an object would just blink out of existence absent an unseen changer, and therefore there is a first sustainer somehow keeping everything in existence, and this is related to the very confused argument put forth by Dr. Bonnette with respect to existence at different times and places. Blinking out of existence would be a change calling for a changer, continued existence is not a change and therefore does not call for a changer.",ficino dr bonnette declaring principle ad hoc conflating existence motion existent object circularly employing ad hoc assumption even aristotle understood motion would continue ad infinitum absent impeding medium apply actpot analysis case unimpeded motion fact history a-t folk seem avoiding either intentionally mere lack study see aristotle say subject archiveorgstreamaristotle-physics-book-iii-and-iv-clarendonaristotle- physics-book-iii-and-iv-clarendondjvutxt clarendon aristotle series general editor j l ackrill lindsay judson iv translation b one could say something moved come rest somewhere rather hence either remain rest must move infinity unless something stronger hinders aristotle describing essentially inertial motion note aristotle make attempt analyze motion using potential versus actual position anything sort rather opposite aristotle understood object moved move infinity unless something else hinders aristotle understood motion l l actualization potential requires external mover rather motion thing natural state thing moved thing remain state motion unless something stronger hinders error aristotle made believing sub-lunary motion impeding medium motion thing would call kinetic energy different parameter would call momentum lost perception loss key mistake dr bonnette lack insight aristotle analyzing motion absent lossy impeding medium invented ad hoc baseless false principle somehow requires mover keep moving obviously opposite case stopping moving object requires external mover aristotle correctly stated something stronger hinders dr bonnette dr feser also similarly existential inertia completely backwards object existence existence changed aspect existence therefore changer called account existential inertia yet feser repeatedly asserted opposite somehow object would blink existence absent unseen changer therefore first sustainer somehow keeping everything existence related confused argument put forth dr bonnette respect existence different time place blinking existence would change calling changer continued existence change therefore call changer,feser,3032,0,3022

"UncommonDescent,      The supposed eternal essence of ""T. rexness"" is the thing in dispute. I say that essence is fleeting. Without us to define that essence it's difficult for me to see where that essence lies. We humans may not even agree on what it is. But if it's anywhere, I say it's to be found in its DNA. As I previously said, it's also possible that the ""essence"" of ""T. rexness"" is in birds (No, I'm not referring to Archaeopteryx only, since Archaeopteryx likely evolved from something else. I agree our classification of species is subjective, but based on real differences nonetheless.). IOW, the true essence did not go extinct, we just don't know what the essence is. It did change its form into something we won't recognize superficially. That ""T. rexness"" we see in museums was merely a snapshot of the changing skin and bones wrapped around the true essence which is not simply ""T. rexness"". The true (ultimate) essence preceded T.rex; the skin and bones distract us on the issue. But I still think essence is our way of categorizing like things according to our interests.

"8\. _If you insist that indirect knowledge cannot be knowledge then you destroy your own theory of reality. You cannot directly perceive immateriality. You have no direct access to forms._      Indirect and ""representationalist"" are not the same.

And that's because we are properly disposed towards forms. Abandon this disposition and we enter Cartesian, Lockean and Humean skepticism.

Not a good move.      9\. _No theory is going to put you into my head._      St. Thomas's theory of intentionality does exactly that. I can apprehend your form but not your matter.

" _in the misbegotten attempt of thinking that such a strategy will drag Catholic thought into the mainstream from the periphery,_      That's just plain goofy, stupid nonsense.

If Feser has not credibly identified the real Catholic response to CRT, then his attack on CRT cannot be identified with ""Catholicism"" anyway. If, however, Feser has credibly identified the real Catholic response to CRT, then he won't be **_dragging_** Catholic thought anywhere, mainstream or not.      Moreover, Feser is well aware that _real_ Catholic principles and thinking have been rejected by the mainstream in the West for decades now, and nothing he does is likely to affect the ""mainstream"" anyway.

"Dear Papalinton      While I think some structural changes are due, my comments weren't against capitalism per say.

"Jack, Conservatism’s attitude towards religion defines it because the divinisation of civil society and relativisation of Christianity encompasses all its variations. Rather than get tied down with the less Christian types (Burke’s dubious and latitudinarian notions are of course, outshone by outright denial and, outrageously, REDEFINITION of dogma after dogma in authors like Scruton and Dostoevsky), we can cut to the chase and look at what Russell Kirk had to say.      The great ideological divider between conservatism and the Christian worldview is original sin. For conservatism, civil society becomes religious society or Church (this has NOTHING to do with unity, or collaboration, of Church and State). The most “religious” conservatives are usually the worst ones because they describe civil society as “immortal” and personal in the proper sense – but the Church is the ONLY society to which such terms apply.      Original sin is incompatible with a belief in God speaking through civil society. The divinisation of civil society by “religious” conservatives is their greatest departure from the religious worldview. Kirk saw a history of divine action through civil society in terms that divinised it. His talk of a “collective mind” does not even apply to the Church; this is just nineteenth century bogus philosophy: “How are we to know God’s mind and will? Through the prejudices and traditions which millenniums of human experience with divine means and judgements has implanted in the mind of the species”; “History is the gradual revelation of a supreme design… God makes history through the collective mind” (The Conservative mind).      From a religious point of view this is astonishing. How can the “prejudices and traditions” of millennia, which are a mixture of falsehood and truth, be called God’s mind? These high sounding phrases only restate the blurring of nature and the divine of Classical thought.      Those works you mention do not save Burke, or conservatism, from the charge of being naturalistic, evolutionist Enlightenment ideology, in its pure, counter- revolutionary form. The re-writers of history cannot change the fact that the Church never supported the principal thinkers of the Counter-Revolution; no more than it supported Italian Fascism, whatever the “services” it rendered the Vatican.

"Abstract: Scoring rules measure the accuracy or epistemic utility of a credence assignment. A significant literature uses plausible conditions on scoring rules on finite sample spaces to argue for both probabilism—the doctrine that credences ought to satisfy the axioms of probabilism—and for the optimality of Bayesian update as a response to evidence. I prove a number of formal results regarding scoring rules on infinite sample spaces that impact the extension of these arguments to infinite sample spaces. A common condition in the arguments for probabilism and Bayesian update is strict propriety: that according to each probabilistic credence, the expected accuracy of any other credence is worse. Much of the discussion needs to divide depending on whether we require finite or countable additivity of our probabilities. I show that in a number of natural infinite finitely additive cases, there simply do not exist strictly proper scoring rules, and the prospects for arguments for probabilism and Bayesian update are limited. In many natural infinite countably additive cases, on the other hand, there do exist strictly proper scoring rules that are continuous on the probabilities, and which support arguments for Bayesian update, but which do not support arguments for probabilism. There may be more hope for accuracy-based arguments if we drop the assumption that scores are extended-real-valued. I sketch a framework for scoring rules whose values are nets of extended reals, and show the existence of a strictly proper net-valued scoring rules in all infinite cases, both for f.a. and c.a. probabilities. These can be used in an argument for Bayesian update, but it is not at present known what is to be said about probabilism in this case.",abstract scoring rule measure accuracy epistemic utility credence assignment significant literature us plausible condition scoring rule finite sample space argue probabilism—the doctrine credence ought satisfy axiom probabilism—and optimality bayesian update response evidence prove number formal result regarding scoring rule infinite sample space impact extension argument infinite sample space common condition argument probabilism bayesian update strict propriety according probabilistic credence expected accuracy credence worse much discussion need divide depending whether require finite countable additivity probability show number natural infinite finitely additive case simply exist strictly proper scoring rule prospect argument probabilism bayesian update limited many natural infinite countably additive case hand exist strictly proper scoring rule continuous probability support argument bayesian update support argument probabilism may hope accuracy-based argument drop assumption score extended-real-valued sketch framework scoring rule whose value net extended real show existence strictly proper net-valued scoring rule infinite case fa ca probability used argument bayesian update present known said probabilism case,pruss,1755,1,3076

"Academic philosophers and the defenders of big-time false religiosity continue to persist in the silliest kind of sophomoric debates about the ""existence of God"". The arguments always range between ""proof"" offered by Reason. and the ""proof"" offered by Revelation - but both kinds of ""proof"" are nothing more that the poor servants of the adolescent dilemma of left-brained rationalism.      To ask if God exists is already to doubt God's existence absolutely - and it reflects a commitment to the presumption that God (or Reality Itself) does not exist until it is absolutely proven otherwise. Once it is presumed that the existence of God (or Reality) is in doubt or in need of proof, the dreadful dilemma of separation from God (or Reality) has already solidified, and neither inner Reason nor outer Revelation has sufficient Power to liberate the individual from the (unexamined) subtle and fundamental despair that is inherent in such Godlessness      God must be Realized as the obvious, not ""proven"" to exist. We must abide in the Mood of God-Realization, or inherence in the obvious, rather than in the mood or irreducible dilemma wherein obvious Truth must be ""proven"" to exist. We must proceed on the basis of prior inherence in God (or Reality), or ecstatic surrender of the psycho-physical self in God, rather than on the basis of the presumed mental and physical separation from God (or Reality).      The question ""Does God (or Reality) exist or not?"" is itself a proposition - it is doubt, it is the idea of separation from ecstatic Fullness, it is the self-image of Sinners, it is the emotional contraction of the body-mind- complex from God, Life, and all relations. Reasons and Revelations are only a hedge around the hell-deep fear of sinners - a false sanctuary for the wounded self, who presumes him or her self to be trapped in the dead ends pf the Machine of Nature.

With that weaker Pareto principle, the proof that the existence of a _G_ -invariant preference of the right sort on the distributions implies local finiteness of action does not work.

If Daniel is on the soccer team and deciding how hard to work, it makes little difference whether he is on the Belgian or Brazilian team. But suppose instead that Daniel is has two talents: he could become an excellent nurse or a top soccer player. As a nurse, he would help relieve the suffering of a number of patients. As a soccer player, in addition to the intrinsic goods of the sports, he would contribute to his fellow citizens’ pleasure and desire satisfaction. In _this_ decision, it seems that the number of fellow citizens _does_ matter. The number of people Daniel can help as a nurse is not very dependent on the total population, but the number of people that his soccer skills can delight varies linearly with the total population, and if the latter number is large enough, it seems that it would be quite reasonable for Daniel to opt to be a soccer player.

"The solution is to create conditions where both men and women can flourish in their roles as father and mother as well as in their professions.      And this is not something alien to natural law reasoning.      Pope St John Paul II in his letter to women was quite open about this, to quote      ""Certainly, much remains to be done to prevent discrimination against those who have chosen to be wives and mothers. As far as personal rights are concerned, there is an urgent need to achieve real equality in every area: equal pay for equal work, protection for working mothers, fairness in career advancements""      He mentions equal pay and ""protection for working mothers"". Which means that society should seek to facilitate and make it easier for mothers who choose to work not discourage them from working all together.      Pope St John Paul II also emphasises in the same letter that women's greater participation in society will be the solution to some of the serious problems we face. To quote      ""Women will increasingly play a part in the solution of the serious problems of the future: leisure time, the quality of life, migration, social services, euthanasia, drugs, health care, the ecology, etc. In all these areas a greater presence of women in society will prove most valuable.""      Pope John Paul II was validated, women have been at the forefront of some of the biggest victories for catholic social life, Roe was finally struck down on the basis of the final vote of Justice Barrett, the neo-thomist revival has taken place due to figures like Eleonore Stump. Given all these reasons, I think it's reasonable to maintain that women being a part of the workforce should be encouraged, obviously not in opposition to their family life and obviously not in a way that is demeaning of their motherhood but in a way that recognises both the importance of their motherhood and their ability to contribute in the professional sphere.

"@WCB. There was a recent post that denied God's existence based on the claim that the existence of ugliness in the world impugned God's beauty. It seems that your claim is that God exists, but is not good; or that God exists, but is not all powerful. Either way, you take being all powerful and all good as mutually exclusive given the state of suffering in the world. I will post the response that I gave on the compatibility of the beauty of God and ugliness in the world as I touched on the coherence of the classicial view as it relates to the problem of evil. I wrote:      This is a crude variation of the problem of evil as an argument against the existence of God. The argument from the problem of evil can be constructed as follows: 1. Evil exists, 2. If God is all good and all powerful, He could and would remove evil from the world, 3. As He has not done so, God does not exist.      The variation you have presented attends not to goodness and evil, but to beauty and ugliness and could be constructed similarly. 1. Ugliness exists, 2. If God were all beautiful and all powerful, He could and would eliminate ugliness in the world. 3. As He has not done so, God does not exist.      The reason that I refer to your variation as crude is because you introduce ambiguous language (""sustain ugliness"") and you don't bother to construct your argument well. I have helped with that above, but you have neither had the courtesy of offering a basic definition of key terms like beauty and ugliness (something that could be done in a relatively brief manner even in a blog combox) nor made the effort to understand how a Thomist might define these terms.      To help remedy the latter problem, St. Thomas understands beauty in terms of order and proportion. Something is beautiful to the extent that it is proportionate or well ordered. For example, a face is beautiful in its structure to the extent that its parts are proportionate to the whole and manifest the order of symmetry. A symphony is beautiful to the extent that it’s notes fit with one another in a melodious order. Writing can also have a cadence to it that makes it beautiful. Computer codes are described by programmers as elegant or beautiful to the extent that they are well constructed. So fittingness or order are essential features of beauty. Something that is beautiful is well ordered.      Conversely ugliness is a lack of order. A face is ugly because it lacks order and is misshapen or misfigured. A symphony is ugly when the notes are not related in a melodious order. Writing is ugly when it is poorly constructed and lacks order. Finally, computer codes lack elegance and beauty when they lack structure and order.      Ugliness is both logically and metaphysically posterior to beauty. It is logically posterior to beauty in that beauty consists of right order or proportion and ugliness is privation of that order/proportion. The order is more fundamental metaphysically in that there are consistent patterns to the operation of the natural world. The natural world operates according to laws that can be known. The movement of the planets and laws of motion are so ordered that they can be understood with mathematical precision.      This order is so normal to us that we expect it and are shocked when it is absent. We go to a symphony and expect beauty and are angry when we have paid good money and the notes are cacophinuos rather than melodiously well ordered. We are shocked by a misfigured face in a way that we are not shocked at a particularly beautiful face. The reason for this is that we expect beauty as more fundamental to reality than ugliness.

"1) You can indeed seek something for its own sake while also seeking it for the sake of something else, but that implies there are two motives properly distinct from the other; and one could then perhaps say that what defines the motive of seeking something for its own sake is to not seek it for the sake of something else AND to seek it for the intrinsic value it has. This motive, having such a structure, would still be properly distinct from the other motive which DOES seek something for the sake of something else.      2) So about seeking a thing of intrinsic value instrumentally, I think this just reifies (or is that the wrong word to use?) or reduces the intrinic value of a thing to just a means - you could literally just replace it and have the rich man tell you he's gonna give you much money if you find something completely red today.      The redness in this case, just like the intrinsic value in the other, is just an identifier that you're looking for in order to gain something else. So I think there's a confusion of meaning going on when someone says they pursue X because of the intrinsic value it has. One could take this in an instrumental sense, or one could instead take this in a sense similar to how one loves others for their own sake, or oneself for one's own sake.      When one seeks the good of another person for the other's own sake, I guess one is thereby recognising the intrinsic axiology or value-ness of the person and doing the action on the basis of that.      One sees the value of the other and recognises that benefitting the other person itself, taking the person as the end because they're valuable simply as such (axiologically I guess?) is good. So benefitting them is just intrinsically worth seeking of itself, with the end being the person, and the grounds being the value & worth of the person properly distinct from any other end.         3) As for achieving X for the sake of Y, I think the person doing the achieving is also crucial. For the person wanting to achieve X for the sake of Y, Y is the final cause of **their achieving** X, not X by itself simpliciter.      So it seems one could say that, for the person wanting to achieve X, if he wanted to do this for its own sake, he'd be taking X as the final cause of the very achieving itself, or the seekig to achieve. There's no problem in taking X as the final cause of itself then, since it's not about a final cause inhering in X itself.         4) I'd also love to know the difference between seeking X for X's sake and seeking it for its own sake, because those two seem identical to me - what is ""its own sake"" in regards to X? How could it not be, well.....X itself? Since the ""own"" is self-referential to X?

"Alexander R Pruss: ""there is no objective reason to do or believe anything""      You cannot believe anything at will. Nor are your choices to do something are ever free, even if they seem to be so. All your beliefs and choices to act are predetermined by your genetic makeup and past experiences, which express themselves in the current emotional/cognitive (that is, biochemical) state of your brain. This hypothesis is simpler than to suppose some immaterial stuff, whose interaction with material things, including the brain, would be beyond comprehension.   Also note that being rational is not somehow ""inherently better"" than being irrational or arational. Rather, it's just that rationality is the kind of attitude that pays off most of the time in the long run. And even this ""paying-off"" translates to things that support the survival of the individual, so it can be expressed in value-neutral terms.      ""every reason expresses the value of the thing it is a reason for""   This is false.   For example, if you know that p, and also know that ""if p, then q"", then this knowledge, together with knowledge of the rule of inference ""modus ponens"" may be a reason for you to believe (and, also know) that q. But there is nothing that expresses the ""value of q"" in the state of knowing p, ""if p, then q"", or in knowing ""modus ponens"", nor in its application. They are just propositions, syntactic structures with semantic interpretation according to classical logic.

"Wesley:      1\. But you can seek something for its own sake while seeking it for the sake of something else as well.      2\. So, this is the weird thing about my example: the non-instrumental value is being instrumentally pursued. (It kind of reminds me of Frege's infamous ""The concept horse is not a concept"".) But the point remains that the non- instrumental value is indeed a goal one has, just as when one is seeking to rob a bank, the obtaining of the tools is a goal one has. Sure, you can use ""goal"" or ""reason"" in such a way as to indicate the ultimate goal which one non-instrumentally pursues, but then the account of non-instrumental pursuit becomes circular: you non-instrumentally pursue X iff X is your non- instrumentally pursued goal      By the way, one can combine my truth and ""volitional inertia"" examples. Suppose that a rich eccentric is paying me each time I get something of intrinsic value. I am greedy and generally lacking in virtue, so I pursue all sorts of things of intrinsic value solely for the sake of money. Then the eccentric withdraws the offer. Out of volitional inertia, I continue to pursue the things of intrinsic value, and do so because they have intrinsic value, but I don't suddenly come to pursue them for their own sake. So in this example, I pursue something because of its intrinsic value, and for no other reason, and yet I do not pursue it for its own sake.

The credences or degrees of belief of real human beings are unlikely to be consistent. In particular, they are unlikely to satisfy the axioms of probability, especially additivity. At the same time, real human beings need a way of making predictions. Mathematical expectation is out, because that requires at least a finitely-additive measure (normally Lebesgue integrals are defined with respect to a countably-additive measure but they can also be defined with respect to a finitely-additive one).
