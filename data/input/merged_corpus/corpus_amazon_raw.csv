81,Just bought my second and third one of these.  The first one backs up a desktop computer and monitor and easily runs it for 15 minutes after a power outage.  The new ones are to power my cable box (Comcast) because even the briefest flicker of power and the box goes through the whole five minutes restart procedure.  The other one is just for the modem/router/VOIP/NAT devices.  We don't lose power very often or for very long periods of time but keeping all those devices from resetting and rebooting is worth the price of these inexpensive UPS devices (paid $45 each).  Batteries are easily replaceable and about $17 each for the generic brand.,bought second third one first one back desktop computer monitor easily run minute power outage new one power cable box comcast even briefest flicker power box go whole five minute restart procedure one modemroutervoipnat device lose power often long period time keeping device resetting rebooting worth price inexpensive ups device paid battery easily replaceable generic brand,positive,647,1
57,"So, I wouldn't have purchased this if it were not for my wife, who is infinitely frustrated with my audio setup.<br /><br />I needed something that would sit next to our TV, and be simple to use.  The fact that this has a remote is a nice bonus.  The fact that this can grab my local radio stations is a HUGE bonus - one which I didn't know it could do (does it via streaming).<br /><br />My problem is that I have this setup:<br /><br />Computer requests audio to be played from a Linux computer which uses a M2Tech Hiface to stream digital to my DAC (streamed lossless FLAC).  This then feeds into my preamp, and then amp and speakers.  To access the linux computer that runs the whole show, I have to have her use shell login to my linux host (not easy for most people, and if something goes wrong, she can't fix it).  You can then  from command line play pandora or music.<br /><br />So, those issues being stated, after plenty of research, I chose this.  I can connect this up right into my preamp, and she can use it pretty easily.  The setup was a snap, follow a few instructions, and I'm now linked up with my pandora account (I've got probably 40 stations I've been grooming for years).  Great.<br /><br />I had mistook the &#34;antenna&#34; in the product pictures for a coax hookup for an AM/FM antenna.  In fact this hookup is for the antenna to your wireless router.  Very fortunately, this nice box has the great feature of being able to pickup any radio station that streams their broadcasts (which as it turns out, is almost all of the local stations).  Not only that, but I can get stations that I would otherwise not be able to get at all (since I don't rely on an antenna, just whatever I choose to stream).  how do I get my local stations?  Simple !  you just set your location (enter your city I believe).  And it'll select the right stations for where you are.  It will also allow you to then progress outwards and grab more stations that you wouldn't otherwise be able to get with an antenna of probably any size.  I live in Baltimore, and it allows me to get stations hundreds of miles away!  Very slick!!<br /><br />The one downside to this product is that the built-in amplifier is really pretty poor quality.  However, I didn't buy this for that functionality anyway.  I only ended up using it, as my preamp crapped out, and I'm stuck using the built in amp for the time being.  It's nice that it's available, but don't think that if you have decent speakers, that you'll get very good sound quality.  You're much better off using the 'line out' and putting this into your favorite receiver or preamp, as the built in one just isn't so great, but it's functional.ith an antenna of probably any size.

16,"Can't get any simpler that this.  And it works just about anywhere you can find a flat lip or side panel.  Ideally the lip should be at least 1 3/8&#34; for best stability, but I got it to hold decently well on the short lip of my desk top, which is just 3/4&#34;.<br /><br />Because the front hanger piece can be adjusted to hang parallel or perpendicular, (or any angle in between), to the clamping surface, I was able to get the firmest grip on the side of a bookcase.

I don't knock it with my arm or elbow as I raise/lower/turn in my chair.

53,"[[VIDEOID:3bdd17778455ef097fcffb1d018022b6]] There is a good variance in Bluetooth speakers, from physical design, extras in the box and sound quality. Not all speakers are worth your time and money. This little Cube speaker by iGadgitz is a very interesting speaker; it may be little but it has big sound and it works very well. I did find one potential issue when it comes to the range of operation that I will describe below.<br /><br />This is one of the smallest speakers I have seen and used. In spite of its size, it is a solid and hefty little speaker, weighing more than you'd expect. In my mind this is a good sign: it means that there is more to this little speaker than a cheap little speaker and a sub-par receiver. To be honest I was a little skeptical that it would put out good sound when I first saw this speaker. It has pleasantly surprised me (more on that shortly).<br /><br />This speaker pairs and connects very easily. When it is in discoverable mode it identifies itself as \\""Xquare 2\\"". I had no issue with it pairing to my phone and once connected it remained connected without issue.<br /><br />The range on this speaker is good and I have been able to carry it from the source to a distance between 20' - 30' before it began to stutter or cut out. I have seen speakers that have more range but the majority of them fall into this threshold. Now, that said I need to mention an issue that came up in testing that should be kept in mind. If the speaker is sitting such that the switch and controls are facing down (that is, the control side is on the flat surface where it is sitting) the range is cut very dramatically. With the speaker sitting that way the range dropped to about 6' before it started cutting out. It did not seem to matter if it was the speaker that was moving away from the source or the other way around.<br /><br />I loaded up some music and played it through this speaker and was pleased with the outcome. The speaker has no problem with playing at higher volume, without distortion or \\""washing out\\"". The profile is very good too - the bass is strong and slightly elevated but not overkill, the midrange is very good and the music has depth as a result, and the highs are bright and crisp. For such a small speaker, this one produces better-than-expected sound.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite Bluetooth speakers. It is very small but it has excellent sound and is made very well. The size makes it placeable in areas where other speakers are too bulky to fit. This speaker proves that smaller speakers can have great sound and it's worth its asking price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.er volume, without distortion or \\""washing out\\"".

62,I was very dissapointed with the quality of the headphones they sound very low the battery dies in less then 2 hours which I find ironic because they are not even loud. The range from your phone to the actual headset is probably only like 2 feet because it disconnects everytime I got my phone in my pocket all around upset about the product especially for this price I could've bought any one of the 30 or 40 dollar headphone and it probably would've been the same or better,dissapointed quality headphone sound low battery dy le hour find ironic even loud range phone actual headset probably like foot disconnect everytime got phone pocket around upset product especially price bought one dollar headphone probably better,negative,475,0

67,"[[VIDEOID:ca7421903fd1ad5c64ae1dc42a160649]] Earbuds have always been an issue for me. Mine is one of those stereotypical stories -- I can't find a pair that fits my ears well. I've tried so many types of earbuds and most of them give my ear canals some sort of fatigue. It's not that they sound bad, just that keeping them in my ears for more than 10 minutes is painful. The only ones I could tolerate were the Apple EarPods, and I have a love/hate relationship with them. Sure, they sit nicely in my ears, but them being fully open means I lose my music to the crickets of night and pelicans of day. Well, no more! I found the Flare R2A in-ear monitors, and seems my fear of earbuds is over.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />The R2s began their life on Kickstarter with a campaign that raised over $170,000. That's quite a lot for IEMs, which are a rather niche market. Flare is a British company that strives for excellence in sound, and hopes that the world can join them in this pursuit. Before the R2s, the company made loudspeakers, so in-ears is a bit of a different industry. I think they did a fine job of things.<br /><br />I listen to a lot of different genres of music, but mostly folk and dream pop lately. To test out the R2s, I listened to hip-hop, jazz, EDM, instrumental guitar and piano, rock, classical, and of course the aforementioned folk. They performed consistently well in every genre. They also look great.<br /><br />First, of course, the sound. These IEMs aren't active noise canceling or anything fancy, which is good because noise canceling often diminishes the sound quality. The R2s are still great for keeping outside noises to a minimum. They use the same plushy foam tips as earplugs, which makes for a comfortable and quiet listening environment. I tried them at work, in the bus, walking down a busy road, and even in a studio while recording. There's absolutely no sound leakage at all, which is great for quiet environments, and none of the quality seems to be lost when the environment is noisy.<br /><br />People sometimes rant about flat response and how it's better than everything else. Those people might be troubled by the R2s. They're warmer than most earbuds, but don't have muddy bass. The main issue with earbuds is always treble: there's way too much of it everywhere. Then Skullcandy wanted to have fun so they started adding a bunch of bass to the mix. Everything above 80Hz seemed to have been lost. The R2s have none of those problems -- highs are crisp, mids cut through well, and the lows of course deliver the much-needed punch, rather than a drone. The responsiveness of everything is very tight.<br /><br />As I said before, everything I listened to with these IEMs sounded wonderful. They revealed details in songs that I didn't know were there, while also being comfortable, affordable, and easy to use. The highs were not overbearing, but pronounced; the high-mids don't clutter the highs at all; the low-mids keep all the bass lines in check; and the lows make sure you remember that the bass drum exists without making you forget about the guitars in the mid-range. That's a great achievement. I really love the way these sound. Everything is balanced. Overall, it's a bit warm, but I would much rather it be warm than sound like tinny old Apple earbuds from the early 2000s, with their mesh and bass-less muddle.<br /><br />On to the design. These things are beautifully minimal, but aren't trying to be artistic, which is nice for a change. The earbuds themselves are black (or whatever color you chose), and the tips and cable match that. There's also a rectangular machined aluminum box that splits the stereo signal for the left and right channels. It doesn't need to be as big as it is, but it does add some pizzazz to things. Lastly, there's the 3.5mm connector, which on mine is black with two gold stripes running through it.<br /><br />I love the design, but there's one ergonomic inconsistency: The aluminum box. It looks cool, and I can see why the designer would have put it there. However, if you want to use these as a versatile pair of IEMs, you may walk with them once in a while, or just move around a bit. The latter is inevitable, and when you do choose to move around you'll hear some strange thudding sounds. That's the box attempting to defy gravity. Every time I hear this I tell myself it's cool to look at, but doesn't need to be so heavy and certainly doesn't add any special functionality. The heaviness, I suppose, adds value to the IEMs. I would just prefer it wasn't here, especially when I'm using these to perform.<br /><br />While these are \\""reference\\"" series -- at least according to the marketing by Flare -- I don't recommend using them for referencing. The R2s don't produce a completely flat sound like Sonys do. They're amazing for listening to, but not necessarily for studio work. I tried mixing a few song using them just for fun, and I noticed that most of my mixes tended to lose the low-mid range on other speakers and headphones simply because the R2s are warm. This characteristic is great when listening to music, but not for mixing/producing it.<br /><br />If you're a musician, you'll find that these are great for monitoring (and thus they are named in-ear monitors). I used them to monitor my vocals and piano while recording an entire song and they worked great. The warmth helps make things less straining on the ears, and there's not so much bass that I get a headache using them after a while. I also used these to monitor my synth and the rest of the band while playing live, and the foam tips isolated the sound very well.<br /><br />It's worth noting that since these are in-ear monitors, there is no microphone. The aluminum block in the middle of the cable just acts as a splitter -- there's no hidden microphone. At first this bugged me, because I would receive a call and forget I couldn't use these headphones to talk. After a while, I just accepted it. There's no reason for IEMs to have a microphone since there's no way for you to use it as a talkback to your band or anything. It also goes against the way that Flare built these, which is to solely focus on recreating sound accurately, not adding more sound. Bottom line: A microphone would have been useful, but there isn't one, and that shouldn't be a deal breaker.<br /><br />Here's the verdict: The R2s made me like earbuds again. I was considering the Shure SE215s, but these reign superior. Once they're in my ears, I don't feel like I need to take them out. They feel at home. Even Apple's EarPods, which \\""sit\\"" in my ears nicely, don't make me forget that I'm listening to music through small pieces of plastic in my ears. The R2s do, and they don't look ridiculous like some earbuds. My friend even told me he didn't notice I was wearing them because they're so small. That's awesome.e the design, but there's one ergonomic inconsistency: The aluminum box. It looks cool, and I can see why the designer would have put it there.
