3134,"2\. In a similar fashion, you say that our observation of objects ceasing to exist always and only due to a positive cause is superiorly explained by EIT than by CTST. Now the problem with this is that, strictly speaking, we have never observed (nor could we observe) the occurrence of any *positive* causal destruction. The reason is that the very notion is incoherent. Positive causal destruction implies that the non-existence of a concrete object O is the effect of — brought about by — some cause. However, ‘non-existence’ cannot be an effect. Effects must exist in order to stand in the causal relations they do. It follows that objects cannot cease to exist or corrupt through being caused to do so.

One of the indicators of this is, expressly, the Church's willingness to categorize someone as ""a heretic"" (and not just condemn their teaching) on the basis of not merely that their idea is erroneous, but that _they should have KNOWN better_ , and thus their holding such ideas is _morally_ faulty as well as intellectually faulty. Certainly, the fact that something had been already _taught universally by the Fathers_ was considered sufficient evidence of its bona fides, without either a council or a papal declaration, and indeed its unanimous affirmation by the Fathers _was USED by the Councils_ as the basis for their dogmatic definitions. But at the same time, there were many other teachings that were neither dogmatically defined, nor contested / disputed, that were simply _passed along_ from generation to generation as being ""what had been taught"" and everybody assented to them and nobody got worked up about whether they were held definitively and irreformably or just, you know, the ordinary teachings of the Church.

For if every single molecule _within_ the sculpture (including the one’s on its exact boundaries) retained a mean molecular kinetic energy with a measured value below 32 degrees Fahrenheit, then it will persist in existence. Thus, the kinetic energy of the molecules wholly outside the sculpture are _not_ sustaining causes here. Thus, the kinetic energy of the molecules to which Hsiao and Sanders label as a sustaining cause must be that of the molecules _within_ the sculpture. But in that case, the molecules and activities to which we’ve referred are merely _proper parts_ of the sculpture, not efficient sustaining causes of its existence.

2302,"Also, naturalist's theory of ""spandrels"" is, again, a re-enactment of the **actualization of hidden potentialities existing in prime matter.** (an A-Thomistic metaphysical thesis).

1767,"I've been reading through the complete works of C. S. Lewis for the past 7-8 months. (Reading through his works by genre). When I got to his non-fiction ""popular works"" (such as Mere Christianity, Miracles, etc.), I was surprised that his descriptions of God sound similar to the Classical Theist understanding of God. (At least in some cases). Below are a few quotes from Lewis's books (possibly) showing this.      For each quote, the name of the book (and chapter) comes first.      In this first quote when Lewis uses the word ""Dualism"" he means ""Cosmic Dualism"" (the belief in 2 equal opposite powers that control the universe, one good and the other evil), not ""Substance Dualism"". In this article he's responding to C. E. M. Joad, a British philosopher who was arguing in favor of Cosmic Dualism. (Lewis wrote this essay while WWII was happening).      (God in the Dock, Part 1, Chapter 1 ""Evil and God"")   (Quote)   ""We are left then to choose between monotheism and dualism—between a single, good, almighty source of being, and two equal, uncreated, antagonistic Powers, one good and the other bad. Dr. Joad suggests that the latter view stands to gain from the ‘new urgency’ of the fact of evil. But what new urgency? Evil may seem more urgent to us than it did to the Victorian philosophers—favoured members of the happiest class in the happiest country in the world at the world’s happiest period. But it is no more urgent for us than for the great majority of monotheists all down the ages. The classic expositions of the doctrine that the world’s miseries are compatible with its creation and guidance by a wholly good Being come from Boethius waiting in prison to be beaten to death and from St Augustine meditating on the sack of Rome. The present state of the world is normal; it was the last century that was the abnormality.   This drives us to ask why so many generations rejected Dualism. Not, assuredly, because they were unfamiliar with suffering; and not because its obvious prima facie plausibility escaped them. It is more likely that they saw its two fatal difficulties, the one metaphysical, and the other moral.   The metaphysical difficulty is this. The two Powers, the good and the evil, do not explain each other. Neither Ormuzd nor Ahriman can claim to be the Ultimate. More ultimate than either of them is the inexplicable fact of their being there together. Neither of them chose this tête-à-tête. Each of them, therefore, is conditioned—finds himself willy-nilly in a situation; and either that situation itself, or some unknown force which produced that situation, is the real Ultimate. Dualism has not yet reached the ground of being. You cannot accept two conditioned and mutually independent beings as the self-grounded, self-comprehending Absolute. On the level of picture-thinking this difficulty is symbolised by our inability to think of Ormuzd and Ahriman without smuggling in the idea of a common space in which they can be together and thus confessing that we are not yet dealing with the source of the universe but only with two members contained in it.

His view makes the fires of hell purgative rather than retributive.

So thank you, thank you so much!      @Michael, I saw the post that Ed made with an open thread and I will participate! Today was the first day in weeks that I felt a little bit better. I will try somehow engage in the arguments there, because like I said, I'm not worried about materialism per se (even though the existence of atoms and etc. sometimes puzzle me as to why God makes the world that way, you know? Why the micro exists in a way that it 'seems' that things could be ""reduced"" to them) because of the arguments Ed presented in the prolegomenon of the Scholastics Meta (I only believed materialism in this XXI century sense because I was a foolish boy born in a country that philosophy that is seriously engaging in these points marginally exists - yeah continental philosophy sucks).      My problem is the worse version of 'materialism' that is the buddhist (because in practice, doesn't matter how they argue, the consequences are basically the same but, surprisingly, worse). In these very difficult (to say the least) 3 years of my life. What really broke me from the inside (based on what I was talking about Libet) is the fact that I (and the person that I love with my life in this world, my mom, who's in fact the only family that I have in practice) could indeed be a substance per accidens (to use the best terminology) - because ALL of these ideologies like reductionism, materialism, and especially buddhism will lead to that no matter how they try to persuade or say otherwise. They will inevitably treat human beings as unreal and aggregates or 'useful fictions' (sometimes I think that it was the devil himself who plunges these ideologies into our mentality).      If there is one thing in all these 3 years that I do not forget was the pain (the mental pain and depression) that I felt and still feel. In my 24 years of life, nothing EVER hit me like that. And I don't know how people simply swallow materialism or even worse buddhism of these sorts - if they do really love their own kind ones or have any moral principles about persons at all - they should be rejecting it immediately. Because as I said what caused me all that trauma that still scares me today is the possibility of those things (i.e the fact that we are just an aggregate or unreal and live just to suffer).

And as Pohle and Preuss note in their manual _God: His Knowability, Essence, and Attributes_ , against the traditional doctrine of divine perfection, it is precisely “Pantheists [who] object that ‘God plus the universe’ must obviously be more perfect than ‘God minus the universe’” (p. 188).",reviewhttpswwwthepublicdiscoursecom god commenting view creation follows inevitably nature noted “ hard see different trinitarian claim son necessity begotten father different creation le divine son ” necessitarian view creation thus one several respect noted review position collapse kind pantheism pohle preuss note manual god knowability essence attribute traditional doctrine divine perfection precisely “ pantheist object ‘ god plus must obviously perfect ‘ god minus ” p,theist,828,1

But he teaches here that it is _not_ justifiable to refrain from such criticism merely because it is difficult, or because we fear causing offense and losing friends, or because we don’t want to risk losing status or other worldly goods. For the wicked are in danger _of damnation_ if they do not repent, and we “wickedly blind ourselves” if we shirk our duty to encourage them to do so.

(Or, in the case of the arguments from perfection, it’s _not immediately clear_ that they succeed, and furthermore they create problems for trinitarianism.) Second, Gel’s arguments almost invariably _add to the complexity of theism_ —by, e.g., adding the monumentally controversial principle IoI, or adding claims about which properties are perfections together with controversial claims about the appropriate methodology for PBT, etc. So _even if_ Gel secures a point in theism’s favor, this may very well be offset by incurred complexity costs.

2090,"(continued from previous post)      So, in the case of Honorius, we see this distinction between formal and material heresy is not made, and the question of whether it could have been formally heretical is challenged by the fact that in his own lifetime (at least while holding the Chair), Honorius himself would have been the final court of appeal. Assuredly he would not have taken his own view to be heretical. So right there there seems to be a strong reason to declare he was at least not a FORMAL heretic. But this takes us to the question of the authority of FUTURE councils and Popes. Many questions arise.      First, it seems to me that while current popes have primacy of jurisdiction, and infallibility in ex cathedra teaching, their juridical judgments are not infallible (leaving aside the issue of the infallibility of canonizations of saints). But of course, in their time no one would have the authority to ignore or override a Pope's juridical judgment. Vatican I makes this much clear. BUT, could such a person still believe, privately or publicly, that a current pope's judgment was wrong, even while admitting that neither he (that person himself) nor anyone other than the Pope could juridically do anything about this? It seems this would be the case, though it would also be within the Pope's power to discipline such a person.      So, it does seem possible that a Pope could wrongly judge that someone was not in heresy, or that the person was heretical, but juridically that judgment would still have to be honored, since the current Pope would have the final say in such matters.

I just suppose that Walter would reply, that on these cases we would have the goods while not suffering anything, which is a acceptable view to the non-christian.      @Walter      I see what you are saying. Just a correction: on the view i'am defending God is beyond what we usually mean by good, for He has no essence separate from His essence that He must be a great exemplar of, but is THE good that we all recept a fraction, you could say. It is not a case of the voluntaristic view were God chooses things to be good for no reason so i dont see much circularity. The name ""good"" that we use to Him mean only that He has no lack, but it has little to do with our virtues.      Now, could this Being, beyond our good but also its cause, choose something that we would not choose? I would say that we just cant know much of this answer a priori. Since God has no nature that we can separate from Him and say ""His nature is to choose such and such"" them there is a sense were, while He can by no means be evil*, He is sure hard to predict.      Notice that the monotheistic-or-close pagans, that had no Bible, normally did not really treat God as much similar to us. This because pure reason cant really show much of how He thinks, only that He cant be bad(and what i mentioned below).

1176,"@ Walter Van den Acker,      The little logic puzzles that you are setting are tricks that you are playing on yourself.      ""If logic is contingent, so is God, because the proposition 'God exists' is, in that case, a contingent truth.""      Contingent logic and contingent truth are not the same thing. Logic is a procedure that, properly used, takes us from one truth to another. Contingent truth is not absolute truth. ""It takes an hour to swim across the lake"", depends on the lake, the person swimming, and other contingent factors. God knows all the contingencies. They are in the infinite sequence which is contingent to us, but not to God, who is absolute truth. Furthermore, the infinite sequence is an _image_ of God, a Divine Idea, meaning that God knows it. But an image of God is not God any more than the pixels in your digital photo of a tree are the tree. You cannot say that the tree does not have sap because the photo does not have sap. Similarly, you cannot say that God is contingent from the entertainment of an image of God. The image does not show what God is, but it shows what you cannot say that God is not. Because people, made in the image of God, can be stupid does not imply that God is stupid.      God has no procedure of using logic. God knows the procedure of logic that you use. He created it. That procedure, properly used, is whatever God wills it to be. Whatever he wills it to be, it still allows humans to reason from one contingent truth to another within the composite contingent truths that humans understand.

2018,"Implying that a Pope can teach heresy when not speaking ex cathedra - simply because Vatican I defined that ex cathedra statements cannot be heretical - seems a classic logical flaw of making the conclusion broader than the premises.      The Seventh Oecumenical Council could not evaluate the writings of Pope Honorius as heretical, not only because they weren’t, but because there was no discussion of these writings. If it accepted the history that Honorius was a heretic, it got it wrong.      Vatican I, which left nothing to implication, explained how we ought to interpret its deliberations. Because it defined that all the Popes had “unfailing faith”, the expressions contained in the deliberations of the Seventh Oecumenical Council should be understood as the censure of the extremely negligent behaviour that it was; the term heretic was not as specific then as it later would be. The sense of Vatican I in defining Papal infallibility is obvious; it is prefaced with Christ’s prayer that Peter’s faith would not fail, not merely that he might speak infallibly one a century. Rather than put a strict modern theological understanding of the term heresy into the mouths of prelates in ancient times, we need to apply the modern Church understanding of the Papacy; there is no getting around this.      Whether or not one can be accused of being a heretic for “not resisting an error” and “not defending the truth, one is NOT a heretic because of those things; Pope Felix III, cited in the post, has just explained how to view quite possible uses (which do not convey the understanding of a heretical Pope as we discuss it) of the term heretic in his times!

It also also has wider scope than theism, as it can explain God (if there is a god) in terms of a fusion of qualities. It can also explain the existence of God in terms of a derivative being that supervenes upon the modal space of qualities. Unfortunately, the latter two claims are incompatible with classical theism, as they violate the doctrine of divine simplicity and both conjuncts of the aseity-sovereignty doctrine (i.e., the doctrine that (i) God is an absolutely independent being, dependent upon/derivative of nothing and (ii) everything distinct from God depends upon her for their existence).

2846,"Intuitively, fully fleshed out and plausible versions of mereological and locational perdurance should be available. We can say that objects should be identified with their space-time worms and that they are exactly located at their paths. How to fully flesh out and render plausible either mereological or locational endurance is not as obvious. One can render perdurance or endurance consistent with the empirical adequacy of relativity by either (i) replacing perdurance or endurance with appropriate relativistic analogues, (ii) replacing relativity with an empirically equivalent theory that includes relations of objective simultaneity, or (iii) introducing additional structure into relativistic space-times in virtue of which one can define objective simultaneity relations. Each of these three possibilities faces formidable difficulties that often go underappreciated in philosophy of religion. For example, William Lane Craig (2017, 2008, 2001b, 2001c, 1999, 1990) has suggested replacing relativity with Neo-Lorentzianism, a theory supposedly empirically equivalent to Special Relativity. Neo-Lorentzianism restores three-dimensional spaces located at distinct absolute times.

2004,"@Laudator Temporis Acti      There is nothing about your objection that logically limits its application to matters of religion - if it were valid, it would remove the possibility of objective certainty in any field of knowledge, since any assertion we made would always require the implicit qualification, 'But since I am fallible, I could be wrong about this' (even about e.g. 2+2=4).      I'll mention in passing - the objection, thus taken to its logical conclusion, would therefore appear to be self-refuting, because the objector puts forward the objection itself as objectively certain truth (not qualifying it as 'merely probable').      But be that as it may, I will try to show that (whether or not its conclusion is self-refuting) the objection is a logical fallacy.      This is its basic structure:      It is possible for beliefs of mine to be false.   X is a belief of mine.   Therefore it is possible that X is false.      Consider the parallel argument:      It is possible for cats to be black.   Fluffy is a cat.   Therefore it is possible that Fluffy is black [even though I can see she is white].      The reason that these arguments fail is that I can be aware of more about Fluffy than the fact that she is a cat, and I can be aware of more about 'X' than the fact that it is a belief of mine. If all we knew about Fluffy was that she was a cat, then it would be reasonable to say that it was possible that she was black. And if all we knew about X was that it was a belief of my fallible self, then it would be reasonable to say that X was possibly false.      But in fact, I can know from the evidence of my senses that in Fluffy's case, the abstract possibility for cats to be black is not fulfilled in her particular case. And I can know from direct knowledge of conclusive logical or factual evidence in the particular case of X (e.g. 2+2=4), that the abstract general possibility of my beliefs being false is not fulfilled in the particular case of my belief X.      This is why the general fallibility that is ours as humans does not prove the impossibility of individuals reaching valid objective certainty in particular cases, where the individual is aware of sufficient evidence for the belief.      So there is no reason in principle why an individual, although fallible, might not discover sufficient evidence to ground a valid objective certainty (absolute certainty or reasonable moral certainty as the case may be) that e.g. '2+2=4', or 'The theory of relativity is true', or 'God has promised to protect from error a whole class of statements made by the pope in certain fairly well-defined circumstances'. One would need to examine the purported evidence in each case, but there is no reason in principle that it could not exist, despite our fallibility.

2041," _Is that swapping of caps problematic on your view?_      No, this is no problem for me: I **expressly said** that if the pope (or any other bishop) gives a caveat that makes it clear that they ARE NOT intending their comment to be taken as ""official"" or not as from them qua _teacher_ , it is not magisterial.

Not sure which one.)      _I'm reading you (maybe) as saying or implying that the assertions of a pope in faith or morals cannot fail to be 'binding' on any Catholic to some extent, whether the pope likes it or not; or maybe that this is so, at least by default._      I am saying that the ""bindingness"" is a matter of degree, just as is the _intention_ and the _manner in which the intention is expressed_ are manifestly capable of degree.

The teleological approach is also lacking in Aristotle's purely secularist view.

1988,"Wright is also selective in the way he cites the relevant authorities. For example, while he acknowledges that Chapman is on the side of those who judge Honorius to be guilty of teaching error, he makes Chapman’s position sound more tentative than it really is.  Wright claims, for example: “Chapman is the most hostile critic, and yet all that he can bring himself to say is that certain passages are ‘difficult to account for.’” As we’ve just seen, though, that is far from the truth. Again, in his book Chapman goes so far as to say that “unquestionably no Catholic has the right to deny that Honorius was a heretic”; and in his _Catholic Encyclopedia_ article on Honorius, he says that “it is clear that no Catholic has the right to defend Pope Honorius.  He was a heretic, not in intention, but in fact.” Oddly, Wright does not quote these (rather important) remarks when reporting on Chapman’s views.",wright also selective way cite relevant authority example acknowledges chapman side judge honorius guilty teaching error make position sound tentative really wright claim example “ chapman hostile critic yet bring say certain passage ‘ difficult account ” seen though far truth book chapman go far say “ unquestionably catholic right deny honorius heretic ” catholic encyclopedia article honorius say “ clear catholic right defend pope honorius heretic intention fact ” oddly wright quote rather important remark reporting view,theist,906,1

Everyone here sees this clearly and you wish for us to believe that you are the only person, not just here, but in all of theological history with 20/20 vision on this question? That suggestion authentically moves beyond laughable to worthy of pity.      The reason you are parading your initial premise as the conclusion to an argument is because you are not competent in either theology or the rudiments of logic. To help with the latter point you might read Kreeft's Socratic Logic or Logic as a Liberal Art by Houser.

1826,"Okay now to address your scenario. You are asking whether the scenario you describe is possible. Here we have to make a distinction between something being logically possible and something that is actually the case. The scenario you describe is logically possible in the same way that it is logically possible that God could have made unicorns. However, framing it this way and then going on to say that we should hope for this is analagous to suggesting that we should hope for the existence of unicorns.      The question is not whether it is logically possible in the strict sense. The question is: what from reason or revelation has led you to think that this is in fact the case? After we have all listened to the crickets for a bit, we should be able to move on from this question. Instead we have to put up with folks bending their will to find any figure within the tradition who will agree with their foregone conclusions.      Their approach is not: what is the weight of Tradition on this question. Their question is: can I find anyone who agrees with me. Their question is not: how do I operate within the stream of Tradition making sense of all of Scripture in light of Tradition and especially in light of the greatest figures in the Tradition (doctors like St. Thomas, St. Augustine, etc.). Rather their approach is: how close can I get to affirming something as close to universalism as possible without actually committing myself to propositions that have been explicitly condemned. This is *NOT* a catholic approach to theology.      The problem, however, is even greater than what I have described. It is not that they have neither reason nor revelation supporting their position and they choose to believe it anyways. That would be irrational. However something more is occurring. They actually have both Scripture affirming that few will find eternal life and the greatest doctors of the Church understanding that passage in its very obvious sense and they reject this testimony or explain it away. Again, that is *not* a Catholic approach to theology.      And contrary to the calumnious suggestions otherwise, the concern of those who are speaking out against these trends is ""pastoral"". Those speaking against these trends (e.g. Ralph Martin in his book Will Many Be Saved? and Edward Feser and Fr. Rooney and the Popes who have repeatedly warned about indifferentism) are motivated precisely out of love for those drawn into indifference over sin because of these dangerous opinions. Hard to get people to suffer the embarrassment of a good confession if they think that everyone is going to heaven regardless. And those who say ""well it is possible that everyone is going to heaven"" easily move to: most people are in fact going to heaven for otherwise God would be cruel.

1240,"@Walter and anon. I’m deliberately using necessary in a way that will not be popular here. I think a huge amount of time and credibility is wasted on arguing whether God had choice in something. Pretty much all of those arguments are meaningless. There are some realities God could have brought forth that we can sort of imagine, say that there are two temporal dimensions and four spatial dimensions. Really tricky to actually get your head around, but we have at least some ability to do so. There are others where we just incapable of even imagining. To argue about God’s choices is therefore meaningless unless he revealed something about it.      When I use necessary here, I mean it purely in that it seems necessary in order to achieve God’s plan, which is at least in part to create children who choose to be as like Him, and can therefore participate with Him in the Trinity. That is an astounding thing, a top down view of the telos of the universe.      Arguing what is necessary from a bottom up perspective in the way that philosophers tend to, in terms of what God could and could not do, is like ants on a cathedral wall arguing about the cathedral’s architecture and construction. Yes they are builders themselves and so know something of building, but it’s several orders of magnitude higher in it’s nature than ants are capable of conceiving.

2197," **But the same sorts of thing occur in reverse,** when you judge and evil man to be innocent: in respect of the **mere judgment itself** neither harm nor benefit befalls anyone else, including him. But as soon as you act on the judgment by according him trust as if he were innocent, when he is guilty, you harm _whatever project hinged_ on according him that trust. This usually means harm to yourself (because, usually, you will be a participant in that project), or it COULD be many other people besides yourself. You therefore are **JUST AS LIKELY** to harm yourself and others in this way as in the first case above. The two are entirely analogous.      To look at it from a non-personal perspective: in a court of criminal law, regarding penalties that the law might impose, the judge (or jury) applies a standard of ""innocent until proven guilty"" and a standard of needing guilt to be established ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". But in a civil suit, the judge applies a DIFFERENT STANDARD: the award of damages or benefits is based on a mere _preponderance of the evidence""_ , i.e. wherever the stronger argument lies, there is where the judgment lies. And the judge MUST render a judgment that will be to the detriment (i.e. ""harm"") one of the two parties. Therefore, he must harm one and benefit the other on the basis of merely _whichever is one more probably in the right (has the better argument)_ , he cannot choose to opt out of judging.      Here's the thing: The ""court of public opinion"" and personal judgments are similar to each other in this - that they are RIGHTLY not restricted to bringing conclusions only with evidence showing ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". They both RIGHTLY make judgments based (at least much closer to) on a mere _preponderance of the evidence_ , OR EVEN LESS! And this applies to the vast, vast array of social and civic decisions we must make: I choose not to enter into a repair contract with this roofing contractor because ""he felt slimy to me"", and nothing more specific than that, is a **perfectly appropriate** judgment to make. I don't even have to be judging him to be ""slimy"" as being ""more likely than not"" (i.e. above 50%), it would be sufficient for me to do it based on a lower scale, like 20% or 30% likelihood, because I can go find another contractor whom I estimate is far less likely to be slimy, perhaps ""less than 5%"". Thus I ""harm"" the first contractor based on a very modest basis of evidence, and do so with complete legitimacy.      You might recast this judgment as being not ""he IS slimy"" but rather ""there is a 30% probability he is slimy"", but that doesn't prevent (a) that you made a negative judgment and a negative CHOICE affecting him, and (b) your choice does him harm (in some sense). So recasting it that way still causes the judgment to fall under St. Thomas's stated opprobrium, even though it is manifestly a right kind of judging.      The only way to repair the argument Thomas gives is to reframe it as: it is wrong to make FIRMER judgments (against) someone than the evidence (you have) allows for. And the certain wrongness here lies **primarily in its defiance to the virtues of truth** , and not ""harm to the person.” The virtues of truth (e.g. prudence) would have you make DUE judgments that the evidence allows for, and WITHHOLD from firmer opinions than the evidence allows, and when you violate that, you _harm yourself_ first, before harming some other.

1041,"Hi everyone,      Thanks you all for your responses.      Talmid, you write: ""Either it [Pure Existence] is infinite or it is finite. But if PE was finite them it would be a certain form of existence and so not PE, which is contradictory, so PE has to be infinite.""      What your argument really proves is that the notion of ""pure existence"" is utterly amorphous: it is not tied to any particular form. But by the same token, since it has no form, we cannot say that it is positively infinite, either; all we can say is that it has no positive characteristics at all.      RunDec, you object to my assertion that the alleged distinction between a thing's essence and its existence can be explained in terms of the form-matter distinction, by arguing as follows: ""the existence of an animal might require its material exemplification, but this is not the case with immaterial beings (such as souls, angels, God, or any other candidates).""      Re separated souls: at least we can say that they once had bodies and that they will one day have them back, so we can regard them as being ""branded,"" so to speak, by the matter they informed. Re angels: I'm sure you're well aware that there were many medieval philosophers who held that angels are not pure forms, but possess a kind of spiritual matter, allowing two or more angels to be of the same species. As for God, His essence and existence are commonly held to be identical, anyway.      You also ask, ""if God had an accident distinct from himself (his essence), where would this accident come from? It can't come from the essence lest you accept the precedence of a perfectly simple Essence which is the source of all things, which is what you're trying to avoid.""      I'm quite happy to say that God's essence is simple. What I insist is that God's Mind or Essence has multiple thoughts and intentions which are contingent accidents - e.g. God's concept of this universe, and His intention to make it.      You deny that having an intention is a necessary condition for making a choice because ""if it were, we would never be able to choose anything, since we would have to choose our intention before being able to make a choice, and that is circular or regressive."" However, your argument misconstrues my position, which is that an agent's choice to do something must be (at least logically, even if not temporally) preceded by a plan or intention to do it. Otherwise, it would be impossible to attribute an action A to spiritual agent X rather than spiritual agent Y, as neither of them would have done anything to identify it as the cause of A. But although I produce things (or states of affairs) as an agent, I do not ""produce"" my intentions; I just have them. They are voluntary, but not in the same sense that my actions are. My intentions have no prior cause; I just have them, and that's all. So too with God.      I don't have any problem with an agent either choosing to bring about X or choosing not to bring about X, and having an identical causal history in both cases. What bothers me is the notion of an agent acting without a plan. That just makes no sense. Cheers.      William,      While Ed doesn't deny that God is personal, He construes God's personhood in terms of His possessing an intellect (and will), which in turn is construed in terms of God being Pure Act and containing (eminently) every form which He generates, within Himself, since He is Pure Being. Thus God's personhood is grounded in impersonal notions like ""being"" and ""act"": for Thomists, these are what God is, primarily. I maintain that God has thoughts of His own, which are in some sort of Divine language, and these thoughts are what makes God personal.      I hope Ed spoils himself this Christmas and buys himself a copy of Professor Francesca Stavrakopoulou's ""God: An Anatomy."" It will change the way he thinks about the God of the Bible. Cheers.

2851,"So much, then, for premises (1) and (2). What about premise (3)? I have two replies. First, nothing in the argument or what Kerr says on its behalf in Kerr (Forthcoming) rules out a situation in which an essence-existence composite has existence _neither_ in virtue of what it is _nor_ in virtue of something _ad extra_. In such a case, the essence-existence composite in question would not have existence _in virtue of_ or _from_ anything. Suppose, for instance, that neo-classical theism is true. The neo-classical theistic God’s essence, we can suppose, is not numerically identical to its existence. The neo-classical God, then, is an essence-existence composite.[2] Nevertheless, the neo-classical God is the necessarily existent, unlimited, perfect, ultimate foundation of everything else. He therefore doesn’t exist or obtain _in virtue_ of anything but is instead the uniquely unexplained reality.[3] Everything else, by contrast, is explained ultimately by reference to him. We therefore have a case in which it is _false_ that everything essence-existence composite has its existence _in virtue of_ or _from_ anything. To be sure, _thomists_ would reject this view. But that’s irrelevant. What matters is that _nothing in the argument above or what’s said on its behalf_ gives those who _do_ hold such a view sufficient reason to _abandon_ their position. And in that case, premise (3) is dialectically toothless.[4]",much premise premise two reply first nothing argument kerr say behalf kerr forthcoming rule situation essence-existence composite existence neither virtue virtue something ad extra case essence-existence composite question would existence virtue anything suppose instance neo-classical theism true neo-classical theistic essence suppose numerically identical existence neo-classical god essence-existence composite nevertheless neo-classical god necessarily existent unlimited perfect ultimate foundation everything else therefore exist obtain virtue anything instead uniquely unexplained reality everything else contrast explained ultimately reference therefore case false everything essence-existence composite existence virtue anything sure thomists would reject view irrelevant matter nothing argument said behalf give hold view sufficient reason abandon position case premise dialectically toothless,sceptic,1426,0

3171,"[9] Some recent developments that may favor discrete time are based on _causal finitism_ , the view that every event, state, or substance has a finite causal history. (For sustained arguments for causal finitism, see Pruss (2018) and Koons (2014)). For if time were continuous, then presumably infinitely many distinct states _could_ causally influence (whether directly or indirectly) a final state (e.g., the location of a particle at time _t_ would be dependent upon or causally influenced/explained by the particle’s location at each of infinitely many distinct previous times; or my existence at each of infinitely many distinct earlier times causally contributes (directly or indirectly) to my present existence; etc.). Pruss (2018, ch. 8) argues along different lines that while causal finitism does not automatically entail discrete time, it still provides _evidence_ for it.",recent development may favor discrete time based causal finitism view every event state substance finite causal history sustained argument causal finitism see pruss koons time continuous presumably infinitely many distinct state could causally influence whether directly indirectly final state eg location particle time would dependent upon causally influencedexplained location infinitely many distinct previous time existence infinitely many distinct earlier time causally contributes directly indirectly present existence etc pruss ch argues along different line causal finitism automatically entail discrete time still provides evidence,sceptic,883,0

But, clearly, there is a time when a given material object has not gone out of existence and a time when the object has already gone out of existence. Therefore, instead of defining positive destruction as taking place at a specific time, positive destruction can be defined as having taken place somewhere in a _range_ of times. In any case, we can ignore this complication for the purposes of this post.",may sorites paradox associated positive destruction material object example material object go existence losing constituent atom might specific number atom sharply divide existing existing particular time object go existence clearly time given material object gone existence time object already gone existence therefore instead defining positive destruction taking place specific time positive destruction defined taken place somewhere range time case ignore complication purpose post,sceptic,743,0

For instance, there might be the question as to why reality is so constituted that the successive stages in an object’s life are related by causal relations.

1430,"@Phil Tanny, I can appreciate the desire to avoid getting mired in perpetual kvetching, but it is untrue that unless I can provide an alternative solution, I have no right to dismiss or reject an idea.      I also disagree with the problem statement and the premise that the solution involves some kind of massive payout by the so-called 1%. First, a wealth disparity between racial groups is not per se a problem to be solved. Second, if it is a problem, it isn't necessarily the result of any kind of racism in any tangible sense. It could be cultural, and I claim that the problem is largely cultural (for example, Thomas Sowell, for example, opines that the disintegration of the black family beginning in the 1960s, often assisted by well-meaning social programs, has had a devastating effect on black Americans; I would also mention ideologies of perpetual powerlessness and victimhood that both demoralize and divert energy away from constructive activity toward ineffectual grievance and blame). Third, even if it were racist, I don't see what the rich have to do with it unless you can show that they employ racist policies specifically to impoverish certain racial groups (the targeting of the rich under the pretext that they benefit from a rigged system is the kind of sloppy and unjust rationalization I would expect from a Marxist who foments class conflict). Fourth, throwing money at problems is precisely what (per Sowell) created much of the problems we're seeing today. NGOs, often run by wealthy philanthropists, offer a relevant example of how funneling money and free goods into causes can cause more damage than it solves (the destruction of the Nigerian cotton and textile industry through mitumba, the destruction of Haitian farming through free rice given long after a crisis has passed, even something like the effect of TOMS on African shoe manufacturing and repair). I'm not saying *charitable* work cannot help, but I would be very suspicious of any ""philanthropic"" or even government-mandated solution given their track record. More importantly, no amount of money can solve the basic problem which, again, is cultural. Maybe Catholic missionaries could play a role here. The Catholic Church is, after all, what turned even the pig-chasing savages of Europe into something resembling a civilization. Only after the Church has given structure to the mission to lift black America out of spiritual and moral decay and, secondarily, poverty, does talk of money make sense because only then can it be used and allocated prudently and with care. But expect also a good deal of opposition from those who pretend to be concerned for such minorities, especially when the Catholic Church is involved and from those whose careers depend on maintaining the present status quo.",phil tanny appreciate desire avoid getting mired perpetual kvetching untrue unless provide alternative solution right dismiss reject idea also disagree problem statement premise solution involves kind massive payout so-called first wealth disparity racial group per se problem solved second problem necessarily result kind racism tangible sense could cultural claim problem largely cultural example thomas sowell example opines disintegration black family beginning often assisted well-meaning social program devastating effect black american would also mention ideology perpetual powerlessness victimhood demoralize divert energy away constructive activity toward ineffectual grievance blame third even racist see rich unless show employ racist policy specifically impoverish certain racial group targeting rich pretext benefit rigged system kind sloppy unjust rationalization would expect marxist foments class conflict fourth throwing money problem precisely per sowell created much problem seeing today ngo often run wealthy philanthropist offer relevant example funneling money free good cause cause damage solves destruction nigerian cotton textile industry mitumba destruction haitian farming free rice given long crisis passed even something like effect tom african shoe manufacturing repair saying charitable work help would suspicious philanthropic even government-mandated solution given track record importantly amount money solve basic problem cultural maybe catholic missionary could play role catholic church turned even pig-chasing savage europe something resembling civilization church given structure mission lift black america spiritual moral decay secondarily poverty talk money make sense used allocated prudently care expect also good deal opposition pretend concerned minority especially catholic church involved whose career depend maintaining present status quo,theist,2796,1

Critics of divine simplicity often argue that it is incompatible with God’s having freely created the universe. For if God could have done other than what he has in fact done, doesn’t that entail that God is changeable, contrary to divine simplicity? And if he is in fact unchangeable or immutable, doesn’t that entail that he could not have done otherwise, and thus created of necessity rather than freely? In response, Davies points out, first, that creating _freely_ simply does not in fact entail _changing_. Certainly it simply begs the question to assume otherwise.

As David Bradshaw [notes](https://afkimel.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/divine-freedom-in-greek- fathers.pdf), Clement of Alexandria says that “God does not do good by necessity, but by choice.” (Does this conflict with the Christian doctrine that God cannot positively will evil? No, because we can understand Clement as meaning, not that God could do evil instead of good, but rather that he could refrain from acting at all rather than doing some good action.) Bradshaw also notes that Basil the Great rejects the idea that God creates “without choice, as the body is the cause of shadow and light the cause of brightness” (where he obviously takes these effects of the body and of light to be necessitated by them); and that Gregory of Nyssa holds that God created “ _not by any necessity_ … but because it was fitting.”",father also understand divine freedom way rule necessitated david bradshaw noteshttpsafkimelfileswordpresscomdivine-freedom-in-greek- fatherspdf clement alexandria say “ god good necessity choice ” conflict christian doctrine god positively evil understand clement meaning god could evil instead good rather could refrain acting rather good action bradshaw also note basil great reject idea god creates “ without choice body cause shadow light cause brightness ” obviously take effect body light necessitated gregory nyssa hold god created “ necessity … fitting ”,theist,934,1

2044," _1) Yes it was an act of the Magisterium, even from the Pope himself, thus 2) Therefore the Magisterium is not protected even from heresy in its ordinary teachings._      What, specifically, makes you phrase the second as ""not protected from _heresy_?""      We know that the Church's fallible teachings (I.e. those which were not taught infallibly) are ""not **absolutely** protected"" from ERROR, in that fallible teachings are reformable and might eventually be reformed because they were wrong and needed to be corrected.      But one cannot conclude from this that the Church's fallible teachings are therefore _utterly_ not protected from error, i.e. that there is simply NOTHING that limits how much error they have. That doesn't follow. As I understand it, the Church says of these teachings that they, too, are influenced by the Holy Spirit, in a lesser way, such that the Church will not fall into such error (on non-infallible teachings) that she _lastingly_ leads Christians into grave error that endangers their souls. These criteria are inherently difficult to apply to particular cases, but the basic _idea_ is that, like situation where the Holy Spirit's action by which He molds the teachings of the many bishops so that they (without formal collusion) all teach the same thing so that it becomes an infallible teaching, so also at other times He molds their teaching so that where one or some are in error, others are not, or at least not gravely and for long. This is indeed a protection, afforded to _the Church_ , that does not protect from every error, rather from an error having a certain scale of effect.      Clearly the Arian heresy running rampant was an error _in the ranks of bishops_ so that they were teaching error, but it never swallowed the entire episcopate. Since it is simply the case that the bishops who were Arians were teaching _wrongly_ by their _officially demanding_ belief in Arianism, and since the bishops certainly exercise their magisterial office when they teach in an official capacity in such wise as to insist on and require assent, we know that ""the Magisterium can teach error"" _in at least that limited sense_ , don't we?",yes act magisterium even pope thus therefore magisterium protected even heresy ordinary teaching specifically make phrase second protected heresy know fallible teaching ie taught infallibly absolutely protected error fallible teaching reformable might eventually reformed wrong needed corrected one conclude fallible teaching therefore utterly protected error ie simply nothing limit much error follow understand church say teaching influenced holy spirit lesser way church fall error non-infallible teaching lastingly lead christian grave error endangers soul criterion inherently difficult apply particular case basic idea like situation holy action mold teaching many bishop without formal collusion teach thing becomes infallible teaching also time mold teaching one error others least gravely long indeed protection afforded church protect every error rather error certain scale effect clearly arian heresy running rampant error rank bishop teaching error never swallowed entire episcopate since simply case bishop arians teaching wrongly officially demanding belief arianism since bishop certainly exercise magisterial office teach official capacity wise insist require assent know magisterium teach error least limited sense,theist,2176,1

841,"Hi Ed,      You write:      As Augustine says, there isn’t “any evil [that] happens to the faithful and godly which cannot be turned to profit,” so that, with St. Paul, “we know that all things work together for good to them that love God” (Romans 8:28).      I have to say that Augustine's remark sounds very Pollyanna-ish. There are some evils which can only be described as soul-breaking, rather than soul- making. Three which come to mind are rape, mutilation and torture. These are horrendous sufferings which serve no ""greater good,"" and which can destroy even a good individual's faith, as the following account of the 17th century ""torture in the pit"" illustrates:      https://sspx.org/en/news-events/news/real-life-silences-character      There were priests, many of them good men, who apostasized. What good was served?      You also cite Augustine to support the following claim: ""We cannot achieve happiness in the world to come if we become too attached to the world that is, and suffering is a means of preventing the latter.""      This might explain some of the suffering that befalls adults, but it fails to explain the death and suffering of a child, who has no worldly attachments.      Finally, original sin (or the fall of Adam) is said to be the ultimate explanation for why humans are permitted to suffer and die, rather than enjoying immortality and bliss. I am not persuaded that a dumb choice by a distant ancestor makes it fair for us to be allowed to suffer soul-breaking evils of the sort described above, but let that pass. What original sin cannot explain is the fact that people (e.g. political prisoners, psychiatric patients) have been beaten or tortured to death, while screaming for Divine deliverance or at least some Divine consolation (i.e. a sense of ""I am with you"") at the moment of death, and in many cases, it never arrives: they die in agony and desolation. Spiritual abandonment at the hour of death is the most difficult evil of all to make sense of, and if you can make any sense of it, Ed, you're a better man than I.      For my part, I think it's best to honestly acknowledge that some evil in this world is indeed gratuitous and senseless, and that there are some dark recesses of the human psyche which God Himself cannot reach: He can console us while we're in pain, but not while we're in agony, as that severs the communication channels.

2604,"Gilmore proceeds by employing the notion of an _achronal surface_ (Gilmore 2008, p. 1228). In relativistic space-times, any space-time point A can bear one of three relations to any other space-time point B: A is _light-like_ related to B just in case a signal moving at the speed of light can propagate from A to B or from B to A; A is _time-like_ related to B just in case a signal moving slower than the speed of light can propagate from A to B or from B to A; and A is _space-like_ related to B just in case a signal cannot propagate from A to B or from B to A. A surface is _achronal_ just in case any two numerically distinct points on the surface are space-like related to each other (for a formal definition, see Calosi and Fano 2015, p. 287). Here, we use the term ‘surface’ in a fairly general way; an achronal surface can be a three-dimensional slice of the space-time block.

Here's what I said      ""hence the urgency to show that it is possible for a Pope to commit heresy so that it isn't seen as some kind of novelty""      In this very post he mentions      ""The lessons of the case of Honorius are clear. When a pope is not speaking ex cathedra, it is possible for him to fall into error. ""      To quote Prof. Feser from twitter while he was replying to someone who questioned that the arguments in this post are also used by heretical catholics (sedes, liberals) to habitually disagree with Papal statements      ""But there are also people whose faith is shaken because they think they're expected to swallow that which contradicts past doctrine. There's a danger in not addressing that worry by keeping silent about the possibility of legitimate disagreement merely because some abuse it.""      It doesn't seem that I said anything different, danger implies urgency.      As for what you mentioned about the abuse scandals, personally, I feel it's a bit uncharitable to lay all of the blame at the feet of Pope Francis, 99% of the all the abuse took place preceding this papacy and were just revealed during this papacy, obviously there have been some hush ups which should be criticised but those same kind of cover ups took place on a very large scale during Pope St JPII's papacy, And even Pope Benedict was aware of Mccarrick and had already imposed some sanctions. How Prelates may choose to respond to some scandal is a matter of Prudence, prudence maybe wrong at times. There has also been large scale reform though in regards to the issue though, such as making the reporting process easier, efforts to make the process more transparent, candidates to priesthood are also scrutinized to a very high degree, so there has been some positive change.      As for heresy with regards to sexual morality being perpetuated at the highest level, with regards to same sex marriage and blessings of such couples and the like, the document by the CDCF which was put out awhile ago was quite firm, Pope Francis approved it. Is it not better to go by an official statement then by unconfirmed reports of someone reporting what the Pope allegedly told them.      With regards to Amoris Latetia, Orthodox Theologians like Mathew Levering have shown that the texts in doubt can be given an orthodox interpretation. Obviously it would be better if Pope Francis answered the Dubium himself and we could criticise him for that. But that doesn't entail that this issue is such that people have cause to question their faith especially when orthodox   Interpretations have been offered. In the absence of clarification, one ought to charitably go with the orthodox interpretation while respectfully awaiting a reply. If you are someone with a high position in Rome you could even respectfully use your influence to perhaps prompt some response.         As for ""leaving heterodox opinion at the highest levels standing without clear or any correction"", It can even be argued that Pope John Paul II did the same with Walter Kasper by promoting him who evidently has a heretical postion on the very issue of divorce. Pope Benedict XVI while obviously and sternly disagreeing with him on this issue, did appraisingly mention Kasper's book on Christ in the intro to his final books on the new testament and Christ.

Difficuly one is if there is no real past, there can be no before, now, afterwards.""      The first sentence is not how a classical Theist would make the sort of assertion you are trying to make. If you are going to engage in dialogue where anyone at all takes you seriously, you are going to have to make more effort understanding the positions you appear hell bent on rejecting. Perhaps if you at least understand them correctly, that spark within you that cares about understanding rather than pretending might be fanned into a flame.      To say is correctly, you would say that God is not bound by time. That is a correct way to state the initial premise in an argument that you are set on criticizing. Now this requires an understanding of time and time's relation to matter, if you are going to actually understand a classical theist on this point.      In your third sentence quoted above you move from talking about God being outside time to simply making the assertion that this entails that there is not past, present, or future. Here you move from the assertion that since God is outside time, everyone and everything must be outside time. Well once it is framed that way (and this is an accurate way to frame the issue based on St. Augustine and St. Thomas' understanding of the relationship between time and matter--again more below--and God's relationship to time and matter), it becomes clear that what you are saying is sheer nonsense. So if you are going to frame a critique of classical theism, you are going to have to offer something beyond a sophmoric and blundering misinterpretation and misrepresentation of the premises of the classical theists argument.      Regarding the relationship between time and matter, Philo and St. Augustine held that these are interdependent and this is confirmed by modern physics (See Barr's Modern Physics and Ancient Faith). We are subject to the limits associated with time because we are corporeal beings and there is interrelationship between time and matter. After all, we measure time with respect to the movement of matter (e.g. the rotation of the earth around the sun). So the argument requires a deeper understanding and exposition of their understanding of time in order to get their argument right in the first place.      You have not taken the time to understand all of this which is why there is no one here that is impressed with what you have to say on this matter. If you wish to have your arguments taken seriously, why don't you first make a serious effort to consider the arguments of figures like St. Augustine and St. Thomas? This of course requires that you actually make a good faith effort to understand them on their terms. Now this would also require a smidge of humility in recognizing that they have something to teach you and that it is, to put it gently, relatively unlikely that you have created a fool proof argument against God's existence that no one else has ever considered.

It is the outcome of the absence of any unbalanced force applied to the object, combined with its natural tendency to keep moving unless such a force is encountered. Of course, one may ask why the motion or existence of any object is characterized by inertia, and the inertialist in either context may or may not be able to provide an answer… But even if the existential inertialist cannot identify any deeper metaphysical basis for this form of inertia, this in no way invalidates [EIT] as an explanation of the world’s continuance; it is not a condition on legitimate explanation that a deeper explanation for every statement in the explanans always be ready to hand, or even that it exist at all.

2608,"Although a foot causing an impression in some sand from eternity past is a common example of a cause that does not precede its effect, we do not find the example convincing. According to accounts on which causes are substances that produce their effects, why think that the foot must have _produced_ the impression in the sand? Consider, for example, a situation in which there already existed an impression in some sand and, at some subsequent time, a foot exactly matching the impression comes to rest in the impression. Although one could argue that some cause needs to be posited to explain the shape of the impression or to explain why the impression exactly matches the foot, the foot would not be posited as the mediate cause of the impression. We can consider moving the time that the foot comes to rest in the impression arbitrarily far into the past. Points at positive or negative infinity are not standardly included on the real line. Therefore, when we move the event of the foot coming to rest in the impression infinitely far into the past, we remove that event from the timeline altogether. Since, by construction, the production of the impression occurred prior to the foot coming to rest in the impression, we would also have removed the production of the impression from the timeline. There would be no event involving the creation of the impression. So, where some have argued that the foot is the eternal cause of the impression, we can instead imagine that the foot and impression have simply co-existed for all eternity without positing that one is the cause of the other.[14] Whatever one might make of this argument, we think that there is a deeper reason to deny simultaneous causation.",although foot causing impression sand eternity past common example cause precede effect find example convincing according account cause substance produce effect think foot must produced impression sand consider example situation already existed impression sand subsequent time foot exactly matching impression come rest impression although one could argue cause need posited explain shape impression explain impression exactly match foot foot would posited mediate cause impression consider moving time foot come rest impression arbitrarily far past point positive negative infinity standardly included real line therefore move event foot coming rest impression infinitely far past remove event timeline altogether since construction production impression occurred prior foot coming rest impression would also removed production impression timeline would event involving creation impression argued foot eternal cause impression instead imagine foot impression simply co-existed eternity without positing one cause whatever one might make argument think deeper reason deny simultaneous causation,sceptic,1712,0

2296,"While I hold a lot of skepticism about McGinn's use of mysterianism on the hard problem of conscious thought, as a Cathlolic I also would tend to be very, very cautious about castigating mysterianism _altogether_. After all, we Catholics are in the position of positing that without the grace of faith, we **could not know** that God is a trinity of persons, and further that we cannot really _understand_ (fully) the Trinity in our present state (behind the veil, through a glass darkly).      Suffice it to say: we cannot invoke mysterianism _merely_ because it is a hard problem. There must be a properly accounted reason that _explains_ our inability to access the thoughts needed. In the case of God, we are limited intelligences, and he is unlimited intelligence, and so our minds are not of a nature capable (on their own) of encompassing the whole of God. But that account doesn't work for our own minds: presumably, the nature and workings of our minds are correlative to _our minds_.      However, it may be possible to argue that we cannot _in principle_ access the way our minds work **directly** , because when we are thinking an immaterial thought (say, about pi), we cannot ALSO be thinking second-layer thinking _about_ that thought, (at least, without the danger of disturbing and ending the thought about pi in order to think the thought ABOUT the thought about pi. So, (arguably) we could only ever, at best, draw the conclusions about consciousness in terms of _indirect_ considerations, rather than via direct access / observation.

1097,"Among the important additions to the new edition are a few pages addressing the question of whether, given the significant differences between classical theists’ and theistic personalists’ conceptions of God, they are even really referring to the same thing when they use the word “God.” Davies suggests that it may be that “if differences in beliefs about God on the part of classical theists and theistic personalists are _serious_ and _irreconcilable_ , then classical theists and theistic personalists do not believe in the same God” (p. 19). But he also urges caution and acknowledges that everything hinges on what counts as “ _serious_ and _irreconcilable_.” He does not attempt to resolve the matter, but recommends looking at Peter Geach’s treatment of the question (which I discussed in [a post some years back](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2013/06/geach-on-worshipping-right- god.html)).",among important addition new edition page addressing question whether given significant difference classical theistic conception god even really referring thing use word “ god ” davy suggests may “ difference belief god part classical theist theistic personalists serious irreconcilable classical theist theistic personalists believe god ” p also urge caution acknowledges everything hinge count “ serious irreconcilable ” attempt resolve matter recommends looking peter treatment question discussed post year backhttpsedwardfeserblogspotcomgeach-on-worshipping-right- godhtml,theist,902,1
2132,"Well done. You, and I believe someone else, touch on another point I wanted to make but already had a four part reply. :) As you say, there had not yet at the time of Honorious been a formal declaration against monotheletism, so one could not be accused of knowingly opposing a formally established doctrine of the faith. At most, one could say he erred in failing to make an allegedly obvious deduction from Chalcedon (all arguable), but that it seems to me would still just rise to the level of material heresy, because presumably the failure to make such a deduction would not in itself evidence obstinancy in error. And, to be a formal error, there would have to be, I think, a formal declaration of what is to be believed. So I think we are back to (among other things) the question of whether it even makes sense to accuse a deceased person of formal heresy (which Feser has not done I realize), unless perhaps we can explicitly find a place where this person acknowledged he knew his view was heretical and did not care, etc.      It is also fair to say, I think, that these current insights would prevent such declarations against Honorius today. And we might have raise, as i have previously, where future popes could amend the non doctrinal juridical condemnations of earlier councils, but I would have to know more about the status of such statement relative to the establishment of tradition to venture a confident answer on that point. But I am inclined, very tentatively, to say since judgments are not infallible (even if they are at least authoritative AT THE TIME they are given) that they could be corrected later--though of course those corrections themselves could also be the same measure also be reviewed later, and so on.

It is not natural for an essence/ _esse_ composite to be, precisely because _esse_ is not part of the essence of thing. The default setting for a composite of essence and _esse_ is not to continue in being, but to be nothing. Accordingly, there is indeed ‘something’ that needs to be overcome for the composite of essence and _esse_ to be, and this is the thing’s own nothingness; for as long as the essence/ _esse_ composite exists, its own nothingness is being overcome through its possession of _esse_ , which _esse_ it does not possess of itself but through another on which it depends.

1578,"Regarding the council of Orange and semi-pelagianism: Here again, this assertion reflects a high level of confidence and a high level of ignorance mixed in a toxic cocktail. Pelagianism is a heresy. And Church councils condemn heresy, rather than upholding a moderated version of heresy (i.e. semi-heresy).Semi-pelagianism, which is imprecise and often undefined, denies the role of God's grace in the initial movement of the will toward God. This is denied by both the Council of Orange and St. Augustine. In fact it is condemned by the Council of Orange as heresy. So, the council of Orange *nowhere* condemned St. Augustine. It did however condemn a version of the very same heresy that St. Augustine fought so tirelessly against.      Now, the key here for anyone who cares about orthodoxy is that heresy and orthodoxy are not defined by the self-appointed pope WCB. It is defined by the Church that the Scripture's refer to as ""the pillar and foundation of truth"" and which Christ said ""the gates of hell will not prevail against it"". Satan is the father of lies and where lies prevail (e.g. in the thought of WCB), there Satan prevails. This has not and cannot happen in Christ's Church which is the pillar and foundation of truth. So, as I mentioned below, WCB, no one here is interested in joining the cult of WCB. Your judgements are pervasively erroneous and you should consider tempering that unflinching confidence in your own wisdom. Trusting that rickety old bridge is going to lead you to fall into a pit.      As a final note to the interested reader, it is not enough to read Scripture and quote it. We have to interpret it correctly and there is such a thing as a heretical interpretation (for examples of this, review the writings of WCB). Pelagius was, after all, not reading the funny papers when he arrived at his position that ""there was when the word was not"". He was reading the book of Proverbs and offering a heretical interpretation of this book (He also wrote a commentary on Romans.). So, it is not enough to quote Scripture. Satan quoted Scripture. You have to interpret it truly with the pillar and foundation of truth and this involves submitting to the judgements of Church councils which are under the guidance of the Holy Spirit as we see in Acts 15 from St. James' words (""it seemed good to us and to the Holy Spirit"") as the council sent out letters to the Churches notifying all Christians of the decision of the council. They did not say, ""well take a bible--if your literate--and decide what you think on this issue and, if you are not literate, just follow whoever is most able to convince you with ""smooth and flattering words that will ""tickle your ears"" (two quotes from Scripture, I will leave to the reader to look them up). Instead, everyone knew that they must obey the judgement of the leaders of the Church at the Jerusalem council. After all, Hebrews teaches, ""Obey your leaders"". It is for this reason that they did not say, ""Let me see what you think about that and then I will decide whether or not you got it right."" That would be the arrogant and foolish approach of WCB. Instead, they received the letter with joy and docility because they understood the teaching of Scripture: ""Obey your leaders.""",regarding council orange semi-pelagianism assertion reflects high level confidence high level ignorance mixed toxic cocktail pelagianism heresy church council condemn heresy rather upholding moderated version heresy ie semi-heresysemi-pelagianism imprecise often undefined denies role grace initial movement toward god denied council orange st augustine fact condemned council orange heresy council orange nowhere condemned st augustine however condemn version heresy st augustine fought tirelessly key anyone care orthodoxy heresy orthodoxy defined self-appointed pope wcb defined church refer pillar foundation truth christ said gate hell prevail satan father lie lie prevail eg thought wcb satan prevails happen church pillar foundation truth mentioned wcb one interested joining cult wcb judgement pervasively erroneous consider tempering unflinching confidence wisdom trusting rickety old bridge going lead fall pit final note interested reader enough read scripture quote interpret correctly thing heretical interpretation example review writing wcb pelagius reading funny paper arrived position word reading book proverb offering heretical interpretation book also wrote commentary roman enough quote scripture satan quoted scripture interpret truly pillar foundation truth involves submitting judgement church council guidance holy spirit see act st word seemed good u holy spirit council sent letter church notifying christian decision council say well take bible -- literate -- decide think issue literate follow whoever able convince smooth flattering word tickle ear two quote scripture leave reader look instead everyone knew must obey judgement leader church jerusalem council hebrew teach obey leader reason say let see think decide whether got right would arrogant foolish approach wcb instead received letter joy docility understood teaching scripture obey leader,theist,3256,1

Because they are simply the _kinds_ of properties that _require_ co-instantiation. This seems to be a perfectly legitimate explanation of their compresence or unity in something. It does seem somewhat odd to demand some sort of concurrent sustaining cause keeping the two properties together. And this plausibly generalizes to a being whose parts are all the _kinds_ of things that _require_ their unity and co-instantiation.

2118,"I want to pick up on something that Todd said, above:      _authoritative magisterium (i.e. non-infallible)_      I have seen phrases similar to this in many comments (not just blog comments, but (probably even more) news articles and editorial comments in published sources. I want to cry 'foul' on the idea of an ""authoritative magisterium"" of the pope, being somehow a distinct category from his other stuff that he teaches that is, you know, NOT ""authoritative"" or not ""magisterial"" or not ""authoritatively magisterial"".      **There ain't no sich category"".**      At least, that's what I am inclined to argue, though I am willing to be given better material to become educated on the issue.      Pope's generally don't go around stating which of their teachings are ""authoritative"" or ""magisterial"". By coming from a bishop, they automatically _participate_ in the magisterial office of the Church. That's it. All bishops participate in that office, and they are all _authoritative_ when they exercise their authority to teach. Period.      The bishops (all of them) _must necessarily_ participate in the magisterial office of the Church in order to be the agents by which a teaching be infallibly taught _by the universal magisterium of the bishops around the world_. If they can do it SOME of the time, then they **have** the role. And they all have the authority.      Now, there are indeed different _degrees_ by which those teachings enjoy the protection of the Holy Spirit. THAT's open to ""full"" versus something lesser. A pope has a heavier hand in that _being protected_ than other bishops, but his participation in the magisterial office isn't _utterly_ unlike that of the other bishops. He can still err (as proven), and (more importantly) _just like the other bishops_ his teachings are capable of DIFFERENT DEGREES of commanding that respect that comes under ""religious assent"" from the people of the Church. A pope, just like other bishops, teaches some things mildly, some things firmly, and some things _very_ firmly, without invoking the infallibility of an ex cathedra declaration. Similarly, popes (and other bishops) teach some things _in identical fashion_ as those before him for many centuries had, for some things, while on other things he sets out with a new metaphor, or a new explanation for an old doctrine, and _all the degrees in between_ that carry all the possible degrees of assertiveness.      AND THEY DON'T SIT THERE TELLING US WHERE EACH STATEMENT LANDS on these scales of firmness, traditionalness, etc. Indeed, if anything, the popes and bishops are _highly_ reticent to STATE EXPLICITLY anything about how firmly our obligation of religious assent kicks in for most of the things they say. We are left discerning that by _various markers_ that are available, including tradition, tone of 'voice', type of teaching occasion or document, etc. But (short of a solemn declaration by an ecumenical council) these markers make such discernment a chore and often only _probable_. Such, I think, is the life of the educated Catholic.      I would propose that the only teaching stuff that comes from the bishops that is ""not magisterial"" is the stuff that they themselves SAY is uncertain, putting in qualifiers like ""I feel that this is right, but I don't insist upon it"" and ""there is room for disagreement on this"" and so on. Everything else is ""teachings"" and therefore is magisterial.

1740,"Someone explain ""measure"" to me in Aquinas. Like I'm five. Well maybe 25. This section of De Veritate for example:      Note, however, that a thing is referred differently to the practical intellect than it is to the speculative intellect. Since the practical intellect causes things, it is a measure of what it causes. But, since the speculative intellect is receptive in regard to things, it is, in a certain sense, moved by things and consequently measured by them. It is clear, therefore, that, as is said in the Metaphysics, natural things from which our intellect gets its scientific knowledge measure our intellect. Yet these things are themselves measured by the divine intellect, in which are all created things—just as all works of art find their origin in the intellect of an artist. The divine intellect, therefore, measures and is not measured; a natural thing both measures and is measured; but our intellect is measured, and measures only artifacts, not natural things.      Is a measure, measures, is measured...what is happening? I think ""measure"" and I picture someone with a ruler walking up to a sofa or whatever and thinking: I wonder if that will fit in my living room. Hm. I will measure it and then we will see. That's it. But Aquinas is taking some basic meaning of this word and extending it to a host of other things, and I can't quite grasp what that is. ""Measure"" turns up in a lot of his writing, and whenever it does, I just think: Oh no, not that again. There's a lock on that term in my head and I can't find the key.",someone explain measure aquinas like five well maybe section de veritate example note however thing referred differently practical intellect speculative intellect since practical intellect cause thing measure cause since speculative intellect receptive regard thing certain sense moved thing consequently measured clear therefore said metaphysics natural thing intellect get scientific knowledge measure intellect yet thing measured divine intellect created things—just work art find origin intellect artist divine intellect therefore measure measured natural thing measure measured intellect measured measure artifact natural thing measure measure measuredwhat happening think measure picture someone ruler walking sofa whatever thinking wonder fit living room hm measure see aquinas taking basic meaning word extending host thing quite grasp measure turn lot writing whenever think oh lock term head find key,theist,1550,1

2023,"First, the reason a council condemns someone as a heretic is because of his _teaching_. Hence it is, first and foremost, Honorius’s _teaching_ that was condemned. That means that the _teaching_ was judged heretical. But whether a _teaching_ is heretical _is_ a doctrinal matter, and not a mere historical matter. Now, given that a papally-approved council cannot err on doctrinal matters, it follows that the councils in question infallibly judged that Honorius’s teaching was heretical (whatever his intentions). But since anyone who teaches heresy is a heretic, it follows (at least given that Honorius really did write the letters that got him into trouble, as most of his defenders concede) that these councils _did_ after all infallibly judge that Honorius was a heretic.",first reason council condemns someone heretic teaching hence first foremost teaching condemned mean teaching judged heretical whether teaching heretical doctrinal matter mere historical matter given papally-approved council err doctrinal matter follows council question infallibly judged teaching heretical whatever intention since anyone teach heresy heretic follows least given honorius really write letter got trouble defender concede council infallibly judge honorius heretic,theist,776,1

Also for clarity's sake, I DO NOT believe that Hell is empty, and I do accept the weight of Tradition.      However, so far as I am aware (and this is of course limited - I have not read most of the Fathers & Doctors), there is no specific biblical passage that tells us in certain and definitive terms that THERE ARE some in Hell. It is, therefore, (so far as I know), remotely, vaguely possible to suggest that the biblical passages that point toward Hell are all to be understood as contingent: e.g. contingent on the sinner(s) not repenting.      _More than this, the scenario is *not possible* given the fact that Christ has revealed to us than many will in fact follow the path to destruction._      For all those huge numbers on the road to destruction, they will REACH destruction...if they do not repent. Suppose that **every single** person on Earth (other than Christ and Mary) will be on that road at some point in their lives, and so that road is very, very wide, and heavily populated. But we also know that SOME who are on that road turn around and head the other way - they repent.      Therefore, not everyone who is on the road to destruction _reaches_ destruction. What if 90% who are on the road right now, repent: the heavy population of the road right now tells us nothing about the ratio of those who end up in hell. What if it's 99%? What if it's 100% who repent?      Christ will, at the end of time, judge all people. Those who are judged to be goats will go off to final perdition. What if the class of ""the goats"" happens to have no members - an empty set? The _class_ is still a valid concept, because of the contingent possibility that some might not have repented.      I repeat: I don't think this what the weight of Tradition is pointing toward. I think that Christ **repeatedly** pointed out the dangers of Hell because there ARE people going to Hell.

1699,"My concern is not to assess Francis' personal responsibility or guilt (which we would best leave to God), or even to decide where he would stand in a ranking of popes from best to worst.      Rather, I think our aim should be to defend magisterial statements (albeit non-infallible) from charges of error or inconsistency as far as possible.      Quite a number of Francis' difficult statements are non-magisterial, so for these purposes it suffices to point that out in the particular instances.      With magisterial statements, I realise there is the last resort of withholding assent from non-infallible teachings, by someone who is sufficiently qualified and who has sufficient justifiying reasons. But once someone takes that step in one case, it does seem to easily become a habit, and a bottomless pit of doubt and dissent.      The typical Catholic trying to be faithful, and trying to learn more about their faith from Church documents, isn't in a good position to make these assessments, and they would end up with diminished confidence in a vast range of teachings if they became too easily habituated to having to exercise 'private judgment' upon each one.      So to me it's worthwhile, for the sake of both myself and others, to try to find another way if possible.      In this specific matter of whether we should try to 'convert others' - if we too easily take the most 'anti-evangelizing' interpretation of Francis' words, there will be those who will feel obliged to 'obediently accept' his teaching thus interpreted, with detriment to their own evangelizing efforts. So again, it's worthwhile trying as far as possible to avoid that outcome.

1012,"""Being infinitely good, would it not go against His nature to choose a lesser good, as against a better one? Similarly, would it not go against His nature to to choose not to create, if He knows that the choice to create is better?""      I am also puzzled by this. But since I am not bound by dogma, I am open to accepting that God creates out of a necessity of his perfect nature. But it'd be nice if it can be avoided.      So there's a lot to be said about this, and what I'll mention doesn't come close to covering the whole topic, but I think it's an interesting thought, and maybe an escape route. Consider: one could deny that perfect goodness MUST entail always doing the best, if the best is supererogatory. The very notion of a supererogatory action is that it's a good action you can perform without being anything like an obligation. We can imagine you can, for instance, donate 100 dollars to a charity right now, and it would be good and virtuous of you, but it wouldn't be an obligation. You can fail to do it without thereby incurring in sin or evil.      I think creation might be a supererogatory good like that. If it's supererogatory, then God would be very willing to create (or create the best) without nevertheless *having* to create. So you could say God is somehow likely to perform supererogatory actions, but not determined (thus preserving contingency).      I don't think this works for the problem of evil or anything like that (I very much believe God must, for example, prevent or stop a torture if there is no greater good to be gained from permitting it), but I think it's a nice enough candidate to solve the necessitarian issue",infinitely good would go nature choose lesser good better one similarly would go nature choose create know choice create better also puzzled since bound dogma open accepting god creates necessity perfect nature nice avoided lot said mention come close covering whole topic think interesting thought maybe escape route consider one could deny perfect goodness must entail always best best supererogatory notion supererogatory action good action perform without anything like obligation imagine instance donate dollar charity right would good virtuous obligation fail without thereby incurring sin evil think creation might supererogatory good like supererogatory god would willing create create best without nevertheless create could say god somehow likely perform supererogatory action determined thus preserving contingency think work problem evil anything like much believe god must example prevent stop torture greater good gained permitting think nice enough candidate solve necessitarian issue,theist,1663,1

1442,"N.b. I am the Anon that wrote the above post responding to @Infinite Growth (I had selected ""Anonymous"" by accident from the drop down).      To make clear what I meant by recent politics, take, for example, Act H.R.1226 and Senate Act S.447 through which certain organizations, with the aid of the US government, are trying to extract massive sums of money from the Polish state for so-called heirless property that once belonged to Jews. According to both Polish law and the general legal principle followed virtually everywhere, property without a legal heir reverts to the state after the death of its owner. If a legal heir exists, he is free to pursue restitution like everyone else through the Polish courts. The absurd position of certain groups is that the Polish government should treat these cases in a extraordinary way and offer broad restitution anyway, not to any heirs, because of course they don't exist, but to organizations and people who are not legal heirs. And recall that this was property held by Polish citizens as Polish Jews were Polish citizens. By reinforcing the notion that Poles, as a corporate body, are guilty of collaborating in the criminal program of the Nazis, it becomes easier to make claims on the Polish state. Heirless property, combined with a sprinkle of customary special pleading, misrepresentation, and the thought- diffusing VIP pass that is the word ""Holocaust"", provides a convenient opportunity for unscrupulous organizations to illegitimately extract billions of dollars from the Polish state by exploiting the emotional force of a historical tragedy. Perhaps such organizations should instead direct their claims to Berlin as the German state is responsible for handling the restitution of Jewish property lost through actions of the Nazi regime.

Tomaszewski explicitly says that DDS _is_ committed to God’s identity with God’s act of creation; it’s just that DDS must (to avoid modal collapse) hold that this claim is only _contingently true_. It is true in _some_ worlds but not in others. And it’s _contingently_ true because “God’s act of creation” only _non-rigidly_ designates God. It doesn’t pick out God in every possible world in which God exists. It only picks him out in _some_ worlds in which he exists. But it _does_ , indeed, pick him out in the actual world, and so—as Tomaszewski again explicitly says is a commitment of DDS—it is actually true that God is identical to his act of creation. What Tomaszewski (2019, p. 279) says begs the question is only the claim that _it is necessarily true that_ God is identical to God’s act of creation. _That_ is claim (2*) in Tomaszewski’s article, and _that_ is the claim that begs the question. But (2) does _not_ beg the question; indeed, it’s a core commitment of DDS.

2304,"@ Tadeo:       _They say in the text that the microorganisms that formed the mitochondria were separable in principle - at least they suppose it is that way._      Granting the premise that the theory of endosymbiosis is true, it does nothing to invalidate A-T metaphysics and a lot to support it. I'll go for this: those microorganismos were substances at first ( _per se subsistens_ ), capable of ""independent"" life and then merged. A new organism (substantial form) emerged (new species). The mitochondria would remain there virtually, until through accidental changes it could no longer re-gain (in a natural manner) its independence, becoming an obligate intracellular organelle. (But maybe it could in a laboratory in presence of human beings with adequate technology).      2 questions for the darwinian: what does the environment in which a mitochondrion lived prior to the fusion had to do with the intracellular environment in which it found itself after the fusion?? If organisms adapt to their niches, the extracellular life of the mitochondrial organism would have had very little in common with the metabolic machinery of the cytoplasm of the host. Of course these people can elaborate an unfalsifiable nice just-so sory about how it did happen and the ""powers"" of Natural Selection,* but that's garbage science and should not be tolerated.      For the A-T proponent, the prime matter had ""silent"" potentialities that got activated under the circumstances of the fusion (for example metabolical accomodation that did not disrupt the life of any of the symbionts).      *If they try the ""but there were lots of trial-error attempts and then one worked"", then they are admitting that there is (was) a tendency, for certain types of microorganisms, to co-join so new environments can be tried after that. And not a ""single point mutation or error in the DNA replication machinery"" or any other of the silly non-sense these people claim. An tendencies = natures = teleology = Aristotle.

1266,"“ Psalm 50:11: I know all the birds of the mountains; And the wild beasts of the field are mine.”      Where suffering of animals is as part of nature, we must trust that to God. Life could not have evolved without suffering, and we must trust that the rich tapestry of dark and light is perfectly rounded in the end. “All is well” as He told Julian of Norwich. This is just faith in God’s goodness, and I have confidence that the great suffering of animals in nature will make be a necessary part of a perfect plan when we see things as they are.      Where it’s caused by humans, we are responsible. We each are called to play our part in reducing the suffering of others, as far as we are able. I can’t judge a poor person who overworks a donkey to build a house, or buys factory farmed meat, but those who can afford to support better welfare and always choose the cheapest/cruelest must be at least partly responsible for the cruelty.      It’s similar with children. We can’t see God’s full plan, but we know that life is short for all of us next to eternity. We can only play our part in reducing it where we can, and trust the rest to God.      As Augustine alludes to, some who have suffered the most can become the purest, most loving people you could meet. Others become hard and cruel. God is refining us like “silver in the furnace”. If we go with the process as he asks us to, and most of the saints actually welcome suffering in themselves, we have good reason to believe that it’s to our benefit in the long run. Most difficult of course is when it’s others suffering, especially those we love. But it’s exactly the same in that we can do what we can to help (including righteous anger in the very rare cases where that is the right response), but must do all we can to avoid becoming hard and cruel ourselves in response. Difficult as it may be, we must trust. We must try to see that what is sharp and apparently meaningless in the moment, is very different from the widest perspective.      Ultimately we are all called to follow the “suffering servant”, born to “Our Lady of Sorrows”.

3362,"Pascal famously argued that practical reasoning should lead people to try to form within themselves a commitment to religious practice and obedience, based upon a belief in God. I propose to take a less ambitious argument, which I call the Sensible Argument, and use it to present The Puzzle. I argue that there is a huge puzzle here, about the radical dissonance between the beliefs and practices of many of the purportedly religious. There are, I will argue, good reasons to doubt, concerning many (clearly not all or indeed most) purported religious believers, whether they are indeed believers, or at least whether their beliefs are strong; and religion seems to greatly increase the risks of deception, duplicity, and hypocrisy, as well as self-deception and inauthenticity. By turning towards a religious form of life, one will therefore be adding great morality-related risks. Arguably, if there is a God who deeply cares about individual moral behaviour, he would punish religious moral transgressors more than the secular ones. One is unlikely to be saved from hell (or other severe divine punishment) by becoming religious. If one is going to wager, it seems much more sensible to wager on the secular side.",pascal famously argued practical reasoning lead people try form within commitment religious practice obedience based upon belief god propose take le ambitious argument call sensible argument use present puzzle argue huge puzzle radical dissonance belief practice many purportedly religious argue good reason doubt concerning many clearly indeed purported religious believer whether indeed believer least whether belief strong religion seems greatly increase risk deception duplicity hypocrisy well self-deception inauthenticity turning towards religious form life one therefore adding great morality-related risk arguably god deeply care individual moral behaviour would punish religious moral transgressor secular one one unlikely saved hell severe divine punishment becoming religious one going wager seems much sensible wager secular side,sceptic,1217,0

2283,"Hey, Tom!      Thanks for answering me!      ""Even if you want to suggest that evolution is a good explanation for why we have such a feature, that itself is a pretty bad explanation for the feature itself.""      I don't want to suggest that evolution is a good explanation for the phenomena, I just asked what can we say in response to that - on a philosophical level. Because these guys I quoted use some energy trying to explain features, functions, etc. based on evolution and I wish to know how to prove on philosophical grounds why appealing to that is wrong.      In what follows, I will try to give some background.      ""In other words, how do you know that natural selection is blind, other than by assuming it, in which case there is nothing that you can say? But there is a lot of randomness in the environment in which natural selection operates.""      I'm not advocating that it's blind or not. I was quoting Ed - if I get him right anyway - on his answer to Ben Shapiro in this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FvYwpyFbIQ). You can see the specific question that Ben is formulating at 39:57 and Ed's response in the following minutes (but I would suggest that you watch the whole video).      Now, back to Ed's response - again, if I get him correctly - he's not arguing against Natural Selection blindness, he's saying Natural Selection could not explain why the human mind is directed at truth (it is really important to note that he's talking about TRUTH directness, not just any other feature in the present case) and I agree with him (because just like he said, natural selection explains fitness and passing genes). And it's important to note too the fact that he was presupposing that it was true when he formulated the argument - not because he may agree with it or not - but because its trueness or not had nothing to do to the point that he was making (again, he said that natural selection explains fitness, etc. and that's not related with the mind directedness for truth per see).      So, now that I made this background to avoid any misunderstandings what I'm trying to ask is: could we make a similar answer disentangling body unity and evolution or natural selection claims?      I do not have any problem with evolution at all. I was just trying to say that someone could conflate two problems (evolution on one side and unity and substantial form on the other).      For example: if someone says that our unity is caused by ""an evolutionary process that co-opted our cells to do what they do now'' someone, plausibly, may think that our unity is just an accidental one.      Personally, I don't think that's true - I think that's insane - but some people believe this. But I can't just say that that's insane - that would beg the question. Instead, I would have to argue philosophically to show that. And that's what I'm trying to say: these two problems i.e the unity substance's (or we can think of its organs functions related to each other as one indivisible unity) and natural selection or evolution could have nothing to do with it each other - but they might seem at least to be related and someone might argue something like the example I presented. That's why I'm asking Ed if we could (or how to) disentangle the two (like in the same way when he was explaining why truth per se has nothing to do with natural selection).",hey tom thanks answering even want suggest evolution good explanation feature pretty bad explanation feature want suggest evolution good explanation phenomenon asked say response - philosophical level guy quoted use energy trying explain feature function etc based evolution wish know prove philosophical ground appealing wrong follows try give background word know natural selection blind assuming case nothing say lot randomness environment natural selection operates advocating blind quoting ed - get right anyway - answer ben shapiro video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfvywpyfbiq see specific question ben formulating response following minute would suggest watch whole video back response - get correctly - arguing natural selection blindness saying natural selection could explain human mind directed truth really important note talking truth directness feature present case agree like said natural selection explains fitness passing gene important note fact presupposing true formulated argument - may agree - trueness nothing point making said natural selection explains fitness etc related mind directedness truth per see made background avoid misunderstanding trying ask could make similar answer disentangling body unity evolution natural selection claim problem evolution trying say someone could conflate two problem evolution one side unity substantial form example someone say unity caused evolutionary process co-opted cell someone plausibly may think unity accidental one personally think true - think insane - people believe say insane - would beg question instead would argue philosophically show trying say two problem ie unity think organ function related one indivisible unity natural selection evolution could nothing - might seem least related someone might argue something like example presented asking ed could disentangle two like way explaining truth per se nothing natural selection,theist,3372,1

1112,"""It may matter for LFW where that Will came from, but it doesn't matter for my argument.""      How does it not matter for your argument, if whether or not the model counts as LFW depends on it? Of course if there is such a thing as this ""Will"" which determinately lead to vanilla rather than chocolate, we must be the ones to cause such a Will. Otherwise, again, we are in no control whatsoever of our actions - a Will just emerges (uncaused by us, hence beyond our choice or control) which then causes our actions. Of course it matters for your argument, since if your model is unacceptable for libertarian freedom proponents then it won't work as a defense against my claim (that LFW for humans already involves the issue of an agent being able to cause 2 distinct effects without a change in intrinsic properties).      ""What matters is that there is a Will to do X. And a will to do X is not thé same as a Will to do not X.""      And the problem - to repeat myself again - is that if we are to maintain libertarian freedom, we have to have caused this Will. Otherwise the Will- for-X just emerges beyond our control and determines that we do X, and this is no libertarian freedom.      But if we cause the Will-to-X we cannot require a further, second order Will- to-will-to-X, otherwise we end up in a regress. That's been my point for a while now. So it turns out that this ""Will"" isn't really required for our choices. It's a confused notion that would lead to an infinite, vicious regress.      The existence of a Will-to-X becomes superfluous, since even on the assumption that it exists we must be able to choose and cause it (or the Will-to-not-X) without requiring a further second order Will. So it turns out this ""Will"" is not really required for free actions. In the end, LFW requires that an agent be able to choose and cause X or ~X without a difference in intrinsic properties. If there is a Will-to-X, it does not determine X, and is not incompatible with the possession of a Will-to-not-X.",may matter lfw came matter argument matter argument whether model count lfw depends course thing determinately lead vanilla rather chocolate must one cause otherwise control whatsoever action - emerges uncaused u hence beyond choice control cause action course matter argument since model unacceptable libertarian freedom proponent work defense claim lfw human already involves issue agent able cause distinct effect without change intrinsic property matter x x thé x problem - repeat - maintain libertarian freedom caused otherwise will- for-x emerges beyond control determines x libertarian freedom cause will-to-x require second order will- to-will-to-x otherwise end regress point turn really required choice confused notion would lead infinite vicious regress existence will-to-x becomes superfluous since even assumption exists must able choose cause will-to-not-x without requiring second order turn really required free action end lfw requires agent able choose cause x x without difference intrinsic property will-to-x determine x incompatible possession will-to-not-x,theist,2009,1

1432,"Hi Ed,      In your interview, you state:      ""You’ll also find – and this is something that I discuss in my book – that the Catholic Church and the popes have officially taught for five centuries now that the kind of slavery that was practiced in the New World and the kind of slavery represented by the African slave trade was intrinsically evil. The popes condemned this consistently from the beginning. Now, it’s true that there were a lot of people who simply ignored the teaching but that was indeed the teaching. People often have this false impression…that somehow the Church is a late comer to this. Well, no. In fact, the Church has been consistently condemning what’s called chattel slavery – or the treatment of other human beings as if they were mere pieces of property or as if they were animals or something – for centuries even if the teaching was, again, often ignored.""      I have to say that this is simply incorrect. I refer you to Pius Onyemechi Adiele's work, ""The Popes, the Catholic Church and the Transatlantic   Enslavement of Black Africans 1418-1839"" (Georg Olms Verlag AG, Hildesheim 2017), which was accepted as a Doctoral Dissertation in 2014 by the Faculty of Catholic Theology of the University of Tübingen. The author carried out his research at the Vatican Secret Archives (ASV) as well as the Portuguese National Archives (ANTT). His book is available online:      https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/id/8aa95306-9256-443f-9e89-de5871874288/external_content.pdf      With a wealth of impressively documented scholarship, Adiele demonstrates that the Popes actively supported the enslavement of Africans and the Transatlantic slave trade for nearly four centuries. He writes: ""Even in the face of numerous protests made by some anti-slavery proponents in both Europe and America against the continued unjust enslavement of Black Africans, none of the popes of the Church beginning from the renaissance papacy in the fifteenth century, throughout the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries and up to the first three decades of the nineteenth century ever remembered to hearken to those voices of protests so as to extend their fatherly concern towards Black Africans laboring under the chains of Transatlantic slavery... Even in the sixteenth century precisely in 1537 during the papacy of pope Paul III, when the papacy at last began to show interest in the sufferings of peoples held under the bondage of slavery by condemning the enslavement of the Indians of the West Indies, the Black Africans were left out and ignored in this papal interest in protecting those under enslavement... The papacy showed her concern for Black Africans in 1814 and 1823 respectively only at the motivation of the British government and only on the condition that the British government will help the Church to recover her lost Papal States which were taken away from her by the Napoleonic invasion and occupation of the Papal States in 1808.""

2071,"The bishop's office of ""teacher"" is not exercised ONLY when he _expressly_ ""intends to bind the faithful"" in an _unreserved_ way, for a bishop _cannot_ bind the faithful in that way because he is not infallible. But he still exercises the office of teacher when he teaches in such a way that he expects his people to hear _and receive and be guided by_ his teaching. This is what the magisterial office _means_. The pope, in exercising his _ordinary_ office of bishop of Rome, exercises the same magisterial authority as any bishop does. But by being the pope, his teaching acts also teach the whole world. It is impossible for him to teach ""just Rome"" and not implicitly teach to the world.      Just as is true of ALL the bishops, who teach their teachings in various **degrees** of definitude by which they intend others to receive them, so also does the pope. When he indicates, by details such as formality of venue, tone of voice, and declarative mood, that a teaching is more definitive than usual, we are obliged to give it a greater degree of respect, (i.e. to assent to it with less _reserve_ than usual). As a result of these truths, it will be automatically the case that when the pope wishes to be _especially_ definitive, he will typically be doing so especially _to the world_. But even THERE, he has degrees available: if the pope gives a speech to an international forum of obstetricians and speaks there about the immorality of certain tubal ligations (as contraceptive), it is inevitable that he be speaking broadly to the whole world, in that those doctors are from the whole world and will repeat his teaching around the world. But the venue is not as _formal_ as an encyclical, and so has a lesser degree of definitude - lesser sense that he ""intends to bind"" - as to that aspect. The intention he has is CAPABLE OF DEGREE. Hence the deference we give it must be capable of degree.      Once we realize that religious assent - the kind of assent that is not the ""unreserved"" assent given to infallible teachings - is **reserved** assent, we must realize that it comes in many flavors just as do the reservations by which it is not **UN** reserved. And the _intention to bind_ is also present in many degrees.",office teacher exercised expressly intends bind faithful unreserved way bishop bind faithful way infallible still exercise office teacher teach way expects people hear receive guided teaching magisterial office mean pope exercising ordinary office bishop rome exercise magisterial authority bishop pope teaching act also teach whole world impossible teach rome implicitly teach world true bishop teach teaching various degree definitude intend others receive also pope indicates detail formality venue tone voice declarative mood teaching definitive usual obliged give greater degree respect ie assent le reserve usual result truth automatically case pope wish especially definitive typically especially world even degree available pope give speech international forum obstetrician speaks immorality certain tubal ligation contraceptive inevitable speaking broadly whole world doctor whole world repeat teaching around world venue formal encyclical lesser degree definitude - lesser sense intends bind - aspect intention capable degree hence deference give must capable degree realize religious assent - kind assent unreserved assent given infallible teaching - reserved assent must realize come many flavor reservation un reserved intention bind also present many degree,theist,2230,1

1737,"As I said what really guts me is the fear of dying or believing something that is false. I know I may sound like a hypocrite or a fool (because I never gave up my faith in God). But that's just how I feel. And I admit that I think that I am only that way not just because of the overwhelming OCD that keeps triggering that thought and fear of being wrong in my mind but because I am too stupid and dumb to get things right (I'm not ashamed of saying that because it is true). If you ask me why metaphysical ideas are not affected by empirical conclusions I don't know what to say because I am simply too illiterate to understand the 'why question' and the difference between the two in the first place (even though I read Ed's blog posts about that e.g that one about the philosophy of nature). And I am afraid that someday some ""discovery"" may overthrow all of this.      I know that by the way the empirical sciences are derived today i.e that mathematized and abstract way it has nothing to do with and can't even scratch the A-T Meta at all. But my fear is what if there's some change in the methods or what if some way they could someway turn the tables against us? I admit that is not very clear to me how Metaphysics is separated from empirical matters.      But I remember seeing videos on youtube where Ed explains his road from atheism to theism (i.e by the way of philosophical reason and a lot of time studying those matters) and I think to myself: ""look at the certain look in the eyes of this man and how he defends the arguments he exposes"". I know that for a philosopher a straight face and seriousness don't mean that the argument is, in fact, good, but for the average joe like me, the impressions mean a lot (especially from a guy that comes from the other team i.e the atheist side because there must be some serious argument that made him change his mind in the first place). I think that you guys may understand what I want to say now. At the end of the day, every man wishes to learn the truth and die with it.      I don't know what to say. At Ed's blog, I somehow feel at home - even though I feel a lot of shame and fear of people mocking me and not taking me seriously, for example - it's hard to talk about that at least for me. But I swear to God that that's how I feel and in some way, that's why I'm somehow tied to buddhism because it ''ties'' my intellect into it i.e ""what if that insane ideology is true at the end of the day?"" But the fact is still I'm too stupid and incapable of wrapping my head around it alone (keep in mind that I do not believe in buddhism, as I said, I'm just afraid of something bizarre as that is true).      So, @Michael and @Talmid - I don't even know how to ask it without sounding, even more, idiot but I need to - there is a way to know for certain that nothing that may come in the future or whatever may affect the doctrine of Act and Potency, Substance, etc.? There is something that might turn all of that wrong or its stands or falls without being affected ever by the outward disciplines of science?

Finally, suppose that such abstract universals are not _parts_ of the concrete objects in question. In the case at hand, one might think that temporal concrete objects ontologically depend on numerically distinct, non-constituent objects. Thus, in order to avoid entanglement with debates concerning abstract objects, I advise that inertial theses only deny that temporal concrete objects ontologically depend on numerically distinct, non-part _concrete_ objects.

2065,"@Laudator Temporis Acti      That other fallible humans have a subjective certainty Y, that contradicts a subjective certainty X belonging to my own fallible self, is no proof that X could not be recognised by me as objectively valid. (As with the colour of Fluffy the cat in my previous post) it's only a problem if all I knew about X and Y were that they were beliefs belonging to this or that person.      If all the knowledge that we had access to was that 'I believe X, you believe Y', then since we are all fallible, there would be no grounds for preferring X over Y in regard to their objective certainty.      But the presupposition that all the knowledge to which we have access is of the form 'I believe X, you believe Y', is a type of philosophical idealism: 'All we can directly know is the fact that something is someone's belief - we cannot have direct knowledge of evidence for these beliefs in themselves, whereby we can discriminate which are true and which are false.'      But we do not grant this unproven idealist presupposition (which furthermore is contradicted by our very experience of having direct awareness of evidence); and so we are not led to the relativist conclusion.      In short, we are not reduced to saying, 'Fallible person A says X, fallible person B says Y - who knows?' Each fallible individual can turn to the actual evidence, by which valid objective certainties can be established in particular cases - even if in other particular cases, someone (myself or others) fails to properly examine the evidence, and so actualizes in those particular cases the abstract possibility of falling into error.      I agree that my background and life history makes it more likely for me to have ended up a Catholic than e.g. a Hindu. But that proves nothing. My background also makes it more likely that I will have a valid objective certainty of Pythagoras' Theorem, than if I had been born in 3000 BC. For every individual, particular contingent circumstances channel us into a position where we are more favourably placed than we otherwise would have been to discover objective evidence for this or that truth. That does not invalidate our objective certainty of those truths, once we have seen the evidence. Again the principle: we must examine the actual evidence regarding X (not matters about our background that are logically irrelevant to the truth or falsity of X).      And just on a couple of your other points:      I can agree for the sake of argument that Newman's example regarding the trustworthiness of John or Richard is for our purposes the least satisfactory of his examples, since the nature of the 'evidence' for their trustworthiness raises all sorts of other questions. (His example is nonetheless perhaps a useful corrective against modelling our understanding of certainty primarily on our experience of mathematical certainty, rather than on e.g. certainties that occur in interpersonal relationships.)

1273,"""If the tree of life was necessary for Adam and Eve to live forever, one might reasonably ask, did animals have access to the tree of life? The answer seems to be no.      If the tree of life was unique, it might have been enough for Adam and Eve to eat from, but it would never have been enough for all of the animals of the world to eat from. This may be another sign that the animals were not understood to have the tree of life for their food. If so, then the text of Genesis itself would suggest that, while man was meant to be immortal, animals were not. That would support the idea, based on St. Paul’s statement, that it was human death that entered the world through the Fall, not animal death.      Furthermore, we should note that giving “every green plant” to animals as food does not mean that some of them weren’t also carnivores. It’s not as if, before original sin, lions ate dandelions and toadstools and only afterward did they begin picking on poor old wildebeest. This is something Thomas Aquinas wrote about in his Summa Theologica:      In the opinion of some, those animals which now are fierce and kill others, would, in that state, have been tame, not only in regard to man, but also in regard to other animals. But this is quite unreasonable. For the nature of animals was not changed by man’s sin, as if those whose nature now it is to devour the flesh of others, would then have lived on herbs, as the lion and falcon.      (We should add, lest anyone be tempted to think that this is a forced retreat in the face of modern evolutionary theory, that Thomas wrote these words nearly 550 years prior to the birth of Charles Darwin.)""",tree life necessary adam eve live forever one might reasonably ask animal access tree life answer seems tree life unique might enough adam eve eat would never enough animal world eat may another sign animal understood tree life food text genesis would suggest man meant immortal animal would support idea based st statement human death entered world fall animal death furthermore note giving “ every green plant ” animal food mean also carnivore original sin lion ate dandelion toadstool afterward begin picking poor old wildebeest something thomas aquinas wrote summa theologica opinion animal fierce kill others would state tame regard man also regard animal quite unreasonable nature animal changed sin whose nature devour flesh others would lived herb lion falcon add lest anyone tempted think forced retreat face modern evolutionary theory thomas wrote word nearly year prior birth charles darwin,theist,1659,1

A cup, for instance, is distinct from a particular spatial location, since the cup can exist _without_ being located at such a position. (This shows, moreover, that such a spatial location is not even essential to the cup, and nor does it ever ‘become built into the nature’ of the cup.) But the mere fact that the cup’s particular spatial location is distinct from its essence (and not even included in its essence as one of its essential properties, and not even ‘built into it’) _doesn’t entail_ that the cup’s being in this particular spatial location (at any moment at which it is _in_ such a location) requires some kind of continuously concurrent external causal ‘keeper’ or ‘sustainer’ of the cup’s being in said location. Indeed, the opposite seems to be the case: we have good reason to think that no such continuously concurrent sustenance is required in order for the cup to simply retain its spatial position.",third false inertial persistence would somehow require existence become built nature analogy consider inertial location particular consider spatial location almost always perhaps always numerically distinct essence thing occupying said location cup instance distinct particular spatial location since cup exist without located position show moreover spatial location even essential cup ever ‘ become built cup mere fact particular spatial location distinct essence even included essence one essential property even ‘ built entail particular spatial location moment location requires kind continuously concurrent external causal ‘ keeper ‘ sustainer said location indeed opposite seems case good reason think continuously concurrent sustenance required order cup simply retain spatial position,sceptic,1238,0

My intentions have no prior cause; I just have them, and that's all. So too with God.""      Gratuitously asserted...?      And God said, ""Let there be..."" But, per Vincent, first, 'logically' speaking, he formed (quite _un_ intentionally, apparently!) a prior intention/plan that he would say ""Let there be..."" -- and to be clear, he didn't need to form a _prior_ prior intention (a second-order prior intention) in order form the aforementioned prior intention, because 'logically' (Vincent says) one must form intentions _before acting_ ; and so clearly forming an intention/making a plan is not itself an action; otherwise one would always have to form an(other) intention before forming any intention, so that it would be impossible to ever get started forming an intention/making a plan.      So the question remains, if forming an intention/making a plan is not an action (as it can't be on Vincent's account), then what is it?      Vincent again: ""I maintain that God has thoughts of His own, which are in some sort of Divine language, and these thoughts are what makes God personal.""      It's not at all clear what the point here is, but why not instead the converse: God's thoughts are what make _us_ personal? Vincent seems to think that God's knowing us by knowing himself puts us somehow 'outside' of God's knowledge (not to mention love, care, etc.?) -- as if it must really be himself he knows, not us, not 'personally.' (A queer view, it must be said.)

But, first, this claim is simply flatly asserted. Second—and more importantly—the claim is straightforwardly _false_. For there are _other ways_ to secure God’s uniqueness wholly apart from DDS. Nearly all models of God affirm that God is perfect. In contemporary philosophy of religion, a _perfect being_ is understood as a being that possesses all perfections essentially and lacks all imperfections essentially (Bernstein 2014). But here’s something that seems like an obvious perfection: being the source of every concrete thing apart from oneself (i.e., being that on which all other concreta depend for their existence).[30] But this perfection entails uniqueness. For suppose that there could be two concrete beings, x and y, each of which enjoys this perfection. Then y would depend for its existence on x, and x would depend for its existence on y. But this is a vicious circle of dependence, which is impossible. Hence, there cannot be two concrete beings with this perfection. Hence, there can only be one perfect being in principle.

1788,"The reason there is such a category as “heresy” in Christianity, whereas there is no such category in purely philosophical systems, is that Christianity claims to be grounded in special divine revelation. Anything that purports to be a Christian position must be consistent with that revelation, and the notion of heresy is the notion of that which is not consistent with it. Now, a Christian theologian who is accused of heresy might, of course, reasonably question whether the charge is just. He can try to show that his position is, when correctly understood, compatible with Christian revelation. But what he _cannot_ reasonably do is dismiss considerations of orthodoxy and heresy _tout court_. Again, by virtue of calling himself a Christian, he is committed to staying within the bounds of the revelation, and thus avoiding heresy. And thus he is committed to acknowledging that to accuse a fellow Christian of heresy _is indeed an argument_.

1666,"As Kurt suggests: it may indeed be possible to ""read"" Francis's words in a charitable light in which ""what he meant"" was to castigate the nasty proselytism that uses bad means (and motives) to push people into the Church, and not to throw stones at the kinder, gentler persuasion by which we justly bring others to appreciate the true Church of Christ. But at the same time, Francis used highly ambiguous phrasings to convey that, and - like he has ever so many other times - he INTENDS to be ambiguous, that's is precisely his operating method.      In this case, for example, there is, in addition to the negative-connotation word ""proselytism"" in the second sentence, the word ""convince"" in the first sentence. There is no reason, outside of Francis's choice to put them next to each other, to imagine that ""convincing someone of your faith"" amounts to ""proselytism"". Even if one might have (before this) thought he was **strictly** avoiding the impermissible ""proselytism"" types of action, and merely speaking so as to ""convince"" a listener of his faith, now he has to second-guess whether even that is allowable. And so, Francis chose to cloud up the matter.      It would be silly to look at all the hundreds (at this point) of occasions in which he has done this, and somehow imagine that they come out evenly divided between a traditional and a progressive view of Christianity. They do nothing of the sort: the confusion and obscurity sown is **very decidedly** in favor of one angle, and that's the progressive view. He's never accidentally confusing in a way that promotes traditional, standard Catholicism. So, it's not accidental at all, it's intentional.      (And by the way, in that video by Mike Lofton is FAR from being wholly exculpatory: take, for example, this quote from a 2007 doc. by BXVI's curia:      _The term proselytism originated in the context of Judaism, in which the term proselyte referred to someone who, coming from the gentiles, had passed into the Chosen People….More recently, however, the term has taken on a negative connotation, to mean the promotion of a religion by ujsing means, and for motives, contrary to the spirit of the Gospel that is, which do not safeguard the freedom and dignity of the person. It is in this sense that the term proselytism is understood in the context of the ecumenical movement: cf. The Joint Working Group between the Catholic Church and the World Council of Churches…”_      Sure, the World Council of Churches take the term ""proselytism"" that way, **precisely because many of them think evangelization is a sin**. And so the push on the idea of ""proselytism"" = bad, and try to eliminate the meaning of the term which was just fine until they came along. Trying to control the language to win the debate. And shame on the Vatican for accepting their improper constraint on the term. If you want to shame those who proselytize wrongly, SAY that ""they proselytize wrongly"".

1066,"@Walter   An agent has a range of actions that can be actualized for some given scenario (which provides the common intelligibility for the range of these actions). Since the range considered in itself is indeterminate (and the scenario is indifferent towards any one such action) the agent particularizes out of that range to get an actual action. The particularization itself is sui generis and only exists with some volition itself.      To answer your question more directly, action A and action B are analogous to each other with respect to the scenario in question. If the scenario is for instance that one needs to survive, then the actions ""drink water"" and ""eat food"" can both be said to ensure survival, but in different ways. Since neither of these has commanding power until they are realized, the agent is really open to both.      As such, if you were somehow able to run simulations of this, you would see the agent sometimes ""drink water"", other times ""eat food"".      @RunDec   I think it does, though I will get to what I think is a more core issue that I think you are getting at.      Volitional causation is not univocal. Because it is not univocal, you can have different actions with no intrinsic difference across the agent (until after the action is done). Moreover, ""X"" and ""Y"" do not have any actual individual reality until actually caused.

1599,"This is a new idea that I had not heard of. And I admit that there's room for more understanding, but I would hazard this:      By ""living uterus donation"" do you mean Jane, who is healthy, giving over her uterus to Sally, whose uterus is damaged and cannot be healed, so that Sally can conceive a and bear a child?      If we assume that Jane is not offering her uterus _in order to avoid conceiving_ , the contraceptive aspect of the perverted faculty argument is not applicable. If, for example, Jane is single and expects to stay that way, and stably has not been engaging in sexual relations, she can be presumed not to enter into this for contraceptive reasons. She is not perverting her faculty of reproduction.      Nor is Sally perverting her faculty of reproduction: her faculty is being impeded by a damaged organ, which (apparently) can be worked around by medical means. So far as ""faculty"" arguments go, this is morally licit.      The real weight of the moral difficulty is in Jane effectively maiming herself: it is not _generally_ reasonable to take away a functioning major body part. However, the ""generally"" I added there does imply reservations on how far that applies: it is (by most ethicists) considered moral for a person to donate one of his 2 kidneys to another whose kidneys have failed. This is even laudable: the donor can (for the most part) ""get by"" on one kidney - though they will live a life of increased risk, because they no longer have a ""back-up"" kidney to take over if one is not functioning.      Arguably, Jane can use the same approach to justify donating her uterus to a woman whose own uterus is damaged: if Jane isn't going to ""use it"", she can offer its use to another. However, I see potential quagmires here, and I don't think it's that simple. On the one hand, if Jane is single, on what basis is she _certain_ she will not marry? If she is married, on what basis is she able to definitively decide she won't be ""needing"" that uterus any more? (On the other hand, what if Jane has taken permanent vows of celibacy in a monastic order, and knows she will not be using her reproductive faculties for reproduction?)      Secondly, the reproductive organs are highly inter-related, and it is absolutely _not_ a given that ""because Jane won't be using the organs for reproduction"" doesn't altogether imply the organs have no health function in the body. This is manifestly true of the ovaries, and hormonal activity that regulates tons of other body functions than JUST reproduction. I don't have any knowledge of whether the uterus, like the ovaries, is involved in other activities for health. I suspect that (a) the medical system claims those health risks are minimal, and (b) that they _may_ be oversimplifying the case in saying so, but I don't actually know.      As to being involved in ""the system"": since there seems (to me, indicated above) that there is a plausible argument that the underlying donative action is morally licit _in some cases_ , it comes down to a prudential judgment whether the overall activity is _nearly always_ a donation precisely because Jane wants to avoid the possibility of pregnancy, i.e. whether working for it is supporting something that almost always is being done immorally, or not. If it is nearly always being done immorally with a contraceptive intent, it might be imprudent to _support_ the medical practice by aiding the research. If _not_ , i.e. if there seem to be plenty of cases (even if still in the minority) that are not donations for contraceptive intentions, then I think you can use a _general presumption_ of moral licitness of the individual cases, and this would seem to permit being involved in ""the system"" of medical support / research in the activity. But that's just my opinion.",new idea heard admit room understanding would hazard living uterus donation mean jane healthy giving uterus sally whose uterus damaged healed sally conceive bear child assume jane offering uterus order avoid conceiving contraceptive aspect perverted faculty argument applicable example jane single expects stay way stably engaging sexual relation presumed enter contraceptive reason perverting faculty reproduction sally perverting faculty reproduction faculty impeded damaged organ apparently worked around medical mean far faculty argument go morally licit real weight moral difficulty jane effectively maiming generally reasonable take away functioning major body part however generally added imply reservation far applies ethicist considered moral person donate one kidney another whose kidney failed even laudable donor part get one kidney - though live life increased risk longer back-up kidney take one functioning arguably jane use approach justify donating uterus woman whose uterus damaged jane going use offer use another however see potential quagmire think simple one hand jane single basis certain marry married basis able definitively decide needing uterus hand jane taken permanent vow celibacy monastic order know using reproductive faculty reproduction secondly reproductive organ highly inter-related absolutely given jane using organ reproduction altogether imply organ health function body manifestly true ovary hormonal activity regulates ton body function reproduction knowledge whether uterus like ovary involved activity health suspect medical system claim health risk minimal b may oversimplifying case saying actually know involved system since seems indicated plausible argument underlying donative action morally licit case come prudential judgment whether overall activity nearly always donation precisely jane want avoid possibility pregnancy ie whether working supporting something almost always done immorally nearly always done immorally contraceptive intent might imprudent support medical practice aiding research ie seem plenty case even still minority donation contraceptive intention think use general presumption moral licitness individual case would seem permit involved system medical support research activity opinion,theist,3791,1

1142,"Walter      “ No, suffering is not a necessary part of our creation unless your claim is that the fall was necessary.   The point of the Fall is that man and not God is responsible for the Fall, but nobody can be responsible for a necessary truth. that would be like saying you are responsible for why 1 + 1 = 2.”      Again, I think this is treating spiritual truth a bit like Newton’s laws of motion. The fall is a spiritual fall, it’s when spiritual death first appeared. Death can be seen as disintegration, but the modern, protestant, literalist mind always assumes this to be physical. Do you really think no creatures died before Adam and Eve ate the fruit?      Remember also that Lucifer fell from heaven before Adams fall. There is a far larger canvas here than just Adam and Eve eating something. Creating free, rational beings seems to inevitably result in at least some of them failing in terms if pride, and therefore obedience. If it’s not inevitable, it’s at least the case in Gods perfect plan for creation.      I do however also think that the fall was necessary at some point. We are each created unique. Some of us are like the prodigal son, and some more like his brother. There are lessons the Father wants both types to learn as part of the process of our creation that is this life. Without the ‘fall’ of the prodigal son, there is no opportunity for either brother to make the right choice to align with the father. Just as the creation of our bodies was via a process of ongoing refinement through suffering, our reconciliation with God is a partaking in the redemptive suffering of God as son of man. It’s of course true that man caused our fall. But God’s plan, from a perspective we can’t even imagine yet, is perfect. Nothing has gone wrong. Bizarre as that may seem to us at times in the middle of it, I believe this to be true.

1522,"Even if we look at Eric Perl's treatment of Plotinus's so-called 'necessary emmanation' we see that there is an aspect of necessity involved in it. Perl says on pg. 50 of Theophany, ""The necessity of procession, therefore, is in no sense a limitation on the One, but rather an expression of his absolute freedom from any limiting condition whatsoever."" He's clearly denying that the One is constrained by any 'condition,' but that is something the Thomist would also accept. The 'necessity' refers not to the any external condition, but his pure productivity itself. As Perl says, ""For if the One might not produce being, then his productive activity would be distinct from himself and he would be condition by a relation to his product.""      Why is this relevant? Well, one of the arguments of Perl's book is a situating of Pseudo-Dionysius within a Plotinian and Procline metaphysics. So, Perl goes on to state that ""For Dionysius, as for Plotinus, God is nothing but the making of all things, so that the possibility of not making does not arise.... As in Plotinus, to produce all things is not a ""choice"" on God's part... That God cannot not create is a consequence, not a limitation, of his absolute transcendence, his unrelatedness to that which proceeds from him.""

He points out, first, that “[i]t is not as though objects cease to exist under such a variety of circumstances that we cannot, even in principle, find anything common to them” ( _ibid_ , p. 351). Instead, there is little mystery about the conditions under which objects cease to exist: “They cease to exist when and only when forces act upon them” ( _ibid_ ). This is not some brute fact, “any more than if it were the case that all objects ceased to exist when and only when in the vicinity of objects twice their size” ( _ibid_ ). We need some account of why there is such commonality among ceasing to exist. According to Oderberg, this is explained in terms of a tendency to cease to exist, a tendency whose manifestation conditions involve “destruction by the application of forces” ( _ibid_ ). This tendency to cease, moreover, “depends ontologically on the tendency to continue to exist in the absence of those forces. Nothing can cease to exist in certain conditions unless it already continues to exist prior to those conditions” ( _ibid_ ).

3309,"There are at least two problems with this argument for uniqueness. For starters, merely from the fact that God’s essence is not something that can be shared with anything else, it doesn’t follow that there cannot be more than one God. For all the argument shows, it could be that there are two Gods, _each of which is identical to its own unshared essence and existence_. We need not suppose that they _share one and the same essence_ ; they may simply have _different divine essences_. Perhaps one of them has a divine essence included in which is the essential attribute of _being trinitarian_ , whereas the other has a divine essence included in which is the essential attribute of _being unitarian_ , whereas a third has a divine essence included in which is the essential attribute of _being binitarian_. In this case, each God is identical to its own essence (and, we can suppose, its own existence), and yet there is no single essence that all the Gods share in common. Now, you might object that for each of them to be _Gods_ , they must at least minimally all share _some_ essential attribute, such as _divinity_ or _omnipotence_. But why? Why not instead suppose that they each simply have their own (e.g.) _trope_ of _divinity_ or _omnipotence_? Or why not take a nominalist approach to Gods, such that there are no such things as divine properties that any such God possesses (and, _a fortiori_ , no properties they could share in common)? Or perhaps each God only possesses omniscience, omnipotence, divinity, etc. _analogously_ to the rest, such that we block the need for features that they share in common but nevertheless preserve a _kind_ of common (albeit merely analogous) predication among them.

2601,"[B]y revealing certain conditions as not changes in the relevant sense… we rebut the need for a sustaining cause. … [A]s a change, the cessation of a state requires a cause, and this in two possible ways: a cause acts so as to terminate a state, or a sustaining cause ceases its activity. With the continuation of a state, a cause is needed if the state is of the latter kind, involving certain kinds of change within it, or if a cause which would terminate the state needs to be inhibited.

2309,"Tom:       **In other words, how do you know that natural selection is blind, other than by assuming it, in which case there is nothing that you can say? But there is a lot of randomness in the environment in which natural selection operates. How do you know that God has not set up this randomness through a process above our understanding, the infinite God's acts being above the understanding of our finite minds?**      I don't think that really works conceptually. It's certainly true that God sets up ""randomness"" to achieve His ends in ways above human understanding. The events leading to the crucifixion of Christ are an obvious example specifically identified in Scripture, for instance.      But in that case, the events aren't actually random in the relevant sense, but only _apparently_ random. But once we see the big picture, we realize they weren't really random after all.      If God orchestrated evolution to bring about humans, then it wouldn't actually be natural selection that did it. It would be a situation more analogous to human breeding, what Darwin called ""artificial selection,"" but far more elaborate.      When it comes to breeding, we don't say that natural selection isn't blind, but rather that *actual* selection is occurring. The same would apply here. Natural selection would arguably still be occurring as well (as it is in human-bred animals), but it would not be the explanation for why things turned out as they did.      One implication would be that if you were to seed life an another habitable planet, one where God was NOT orchestrating the creation of human beings, not much would happen evolutionarily, because natural selection in and of itself doesn't explain function.",tom word know natural selection blind assuming case nothing say lot randomness environment natural selection operates know god set randomness process understanding infinite act understanding finite mind think really work conceptually certainly true god set randomness achieve end way human understanding event leading crucifixion christ obvious example specifically identified scripture instance case event actually random relevant sense apparently random see big picture realize really random god orchestrated evolution bring human actually natural selection would situation analogous human breeding darwin called artificial selection far elaborate come breeding say natural selection blind rather actual selection occurring would apply natural selection would arguably still occurring well human-bred animal would explanation thing turned one implication would seed life another habitable planet one god orchestrating creation human being much would happen evolutionarily natural selection explain function,theist,1720,1

3169,"The trouble is that simultaneous causation is not obviously consistent with an orthodox understanding of relativity. As we’ve discussed, orthodox interpretations of relativity entail that objective simultaneity does not exist. Friends of simultaneous causation would be right to point out that they use the term ‘simultaneous’ differently from how that term is deployed by physicists (or even as ‘simultaneous’ has been deployed in much of this post). For physicists, to say that two numerically distinct space-time points _p 1_ and _p 2_ are simultaneous is just to say that _p 1_ and _p 2_ occur at numerically the same absolute time, that is, that _p 1_ and _p 2_ are instantaneous. Friends of simultaneous causation should not be interpreted as endorsing the view that causes are instantaneous with their effects. For that reason, simultaneous causation cannot be ruled out merely on the grounds that relativity rules out objective instantaneity. However, friends of simultaneous causation move too quickly if they conclude that simultaneous causation runs into no problems at all from relativity. The trouble is that the failure of objective instantaneity makes objective concurrence much more difficult to understand. And without objective concurrence, standard accounts of how causes can be simultaneous with their effects break down.",trouble simultaneous causation obviously consistent orthodox understanding relativity discussed orthodox interpretation relativity entail objective simultaneity exist friend simultaneous causation would right point use term ‘ simultaneous differently term deployed physicist even ‘ simultaneous deployed much post physicist say two numerically distinct space-time point p p simultaneous say p p occur numerically absolute time p p instantaneous friend simultaneous causation interpreted endorsing view cause instantaneous effect reason simultaneous causation ruled merely ground relativity rule objective instantaneity however friend simultaneous causation move quickly conclude simultaneous causation run problem relativity trouble failure objective instantaneity make objective concurrence much difficult understand without objective concurrence standard account cause simultaneous effect break,sceptic,1341,0

Differences remain, but only pride could prompt me to continue the argument, pride of a sinful nature.      I celebrate that we recognize each other and Professor Feser as brothers in Christ.      Where I said, ""No one has excuses for their sins, and yet everyone faces attacks caused by imperfect trust in God precisely because we are human, and that is why loving pastoral guidance is needed"", I wish to clarify that loss of trust (faith) is sin and it is the duty of the shepherd to guide the lost sheep back to safety with the flock.      Professor Feser wrote an extensive analysis of the parallel duty of the theologian where such pastoral care is insufficient, this parallel duty sometimes going so far as to criticize publicly. It is taken mostly from the work (Donum Veritatis) of Cardinal Ratzinger. Professor Feser quotes him extensively.      You might find it worthwhile to make a close study of this analysis of Feser's, titled ""The Church permits criticism of popes under certain circumstances"". It is very interesting.

The best or only explanation for this phenomenon is that such objects possess some tendency to cease to exist when and only when subject to such sufficiently destructive factors.[6] But tendencies imply their complements; in other words, the possession of a tendency to cease to exist in certain conditions—“a specific disposition activated by a relatively limited kind and range of stimuli”—implies the possession of “a tendency to _continue_ to exist absent those stimuli” ( _ibid_ ).

1595,"I don't think people most people actually understand the accusation if pantheism they're making. An identification of God with Existence or, to use more platonic language, The One (The Good), cannot in principle be a pantheistic conception, since the world is obviously a complex and changing object. Panentheism may fit better, but even here outside of emanating from a singular object, due to the absolute simplicity of the absolute, it's impossible for the world to be a part of it, it lacks the parts with which anything outside of it could ever truly be related to it. Arguably, the platonist conception of the absolute is even simpler than Aristotle's unmoved mover, for the reason that Plotinus argues against Aristotle's idea of it being Thinking thinking about thoughts. Whether it's correct or not, Plotinus argues that every kind of knowledge involves minimal composition. In that sense, the One cannot be an intellect, which doesn't mean though that it's wholly unmental.      It may be easier for me than for others here since, even though I'd call myself Christian, I have zero emotional investment in the religion and would be indifferent to dropping it, but the accusation that a lofty conception of God removes any kind of personal relation, for me, just shows that we too heavily rely on a, frankly, infantile conception of the supreme being, instead of following the intellectual route of letting ourselves be led into complete apophaticism, in the footsteps of Plotinus and Pseudo-Dionysius. What would knowledge be if it doesn't change? Well, not the knowledge of truths we know it, but acts that *produce* these truths. The convergence with existence and the ultimate dependency of everything on it entails that at the grass roots of knowledge, power or morality, these concepts are entailed by existence/goodness. This is just the logical consequence, something O'Conner hinted at in his book on the contingency argument. Furthermore in regards to knowledge I'd once again reference Barry Miller who quotes Patrick Grim, the idea of omniscience as propositional knowledge (P is true, God knows that P), is not a conception that can be applied to God, this just leads to contradictions.

1260,"@ Walter Van den Acker,      Original sin was the fall of creation and suffering was the consequence of this fall. We are all in this fallen creation. No one is being ""punished"", not even Adam and Eve. They just inevitably chose sin given free will and time. Human free will can also be modelled by an infinite unbiased random binary sequence so all choices exist in it somewhere (as simple a model as you are likely to find). Adam and Eve, in time, chose to leave temporal paradise and enter the fallen creation. Knowledge of good and evil meant a return to temporal paradise was gone without the intervention of God to bring them to the new creation, the eternal (outside of time) paradise with God.      This is where we are, all of us, people, babies, good people, bad people, dogs, ticks, mosquitos, and viruses. There is only one creation (simplicity again). We are all in it together. God did not cause multiple worlds for each to choose, and by the choice define right and wrong (for you are the one claiming to redefine things, not me). As a human with an infinite component to your mind, since you are free, you can always choose your own way to stay separate from God. In eternity (outside of time), when the new creation replaces this one, choosing will no longer be possible, so if you have elected to be separate from God, you will stay separate from God.      The world we live in is not so by necessity. It could have been anything (modelled by the random sequence). It could have been a world in which 1+ 1 is 3 and the rules of logic could have been anything. But the world we live in is the way it is because of love. Love, not necessity. Love is why after inevitably (given endless time) exiting temporal paradise, there is still Salvation if you freely choose it.

3188,"Friends of simultaneous causation might attempt to argue that causes and effects can concur for another reason. Consider that the interactions between the water and sugar molecules can ultimately be understood in terms of the interactions between electric charges and that the interactions between electric charges are ultimately mediated by photons. For example, when momentum is exchanged between two electrons, we might imagine that one electron transmits a photon, carrying the momentum, and the other electron absorbs that photon, thereby receiving the momentum. When an electron absorbs a photon, we might imagine that the electron and photon coincide at a single space-time point. In the Feynman diagram that illustrates the absorption of a photon by an electron, the point where the electron and photon coincide is called a _vertex_. One might suggest that since the electron and the photon occupy numerically one space-time point at the vertex, the electron and the photon — and so cause and effect — come to be instantaneous by co-occuring at the same space-time point. This attractive picture is presented in popular science documentaries, where one billiard ball — representing the electron — somehow absorbs another billiard ball — representing the photon.

They no longer have the cudgel or leverage they once had.      The same is true of feminism. Many feminist demands have been met. But has feminism gone away? If anything, it's become even more radicalized. People often project their personal dissatisfactions and discomforts onto some external, broad ""common cause"". Doing so allows them to feel in control, like they've named the beast. Living a boring life? Must be because of racism. Not getting what you want? Must be because of sexism or misogyny. And once the demands of such people are met, they discover they're still where they were and this is infuriating. A rational person would take this as an opportunity for reflection, but a prideful person will simply double down. If things are still shabby, it's necessarily because we haven't gone far enough!

3077,"To explore how one might update the existential inertia thesis for relativistic space-times, we begin by introducing a three-fold distinction between two non-relativistic space-times, i.e., Newtonian and Galilean space- times, and one simple relativistic space-time, i.e., Minkowski space-time. In Newtonian space-time, at each time, the universe is a three-dimensional Euclidean space consisting of a collection of objectively simultaneous spatial points. The spatial points persist over time; moreover, objects can be at absolute rest by occupying the same spatial point(s) at successive times. In Galilean space-time, the universe, at each time, is again a three-dimensional Euclidean space composed of a collection of objectively simultaneous spatial points. However, absolute rest does not exist in Galilean space-time; for that reason, spatial points do not persist through time, even though material objects may. On either Newtonian or Galilean space-time, material objects can either be wholly located at each of the times that they exist and so endure or have temporal parts located at each of the times at which they exist and so perdure.",explore one might update existential inertia thesis relativistic space-time begin introducing three-fold distinction two non-relativistic space-time ie newtonian galilean space- time one simple relativistic space-time ie minkowski space-time newtonian space-time time universe three-dimensional euclidean space consisting collection objectively simultaneous spatial point spatial point persist time moreover object absolute rest occupying spatial point successive time galilean space-time universe time three-dimensional euclidean space composed collection objectively simultaneous spatial point however absolute rest exist galilean space-time reason spatial point persist time even though material object may either newtonian galilean space-time material object either wholly located time exist endure temporal part located time exist perdure,sceptic,1148,0

2073,"Dr. Ed Feser gives a brief rundown of the “error” and condemnation of Pope Honorius I (625-638). He draws mostly from the Patristic scholarship of great Fr. John Chapman who was a remarkable scholar on the early Papacy and the issues related to the Latin vs Byzantine Churches throughout the first seven ecumenical Councils. In my own research, I have come to think that Fr. Chapman’s is perhaps the best sketch and explanation of the events surrounding Honorius. There can be no question that Pope St. Leo II, the very Pope who confirmed the decrees of the Council of Constantinople III (681), that is, the very council which had accused Pope Honorius of heresy, believed that his predecessor Honorius had committed a heresy. There can be no question that, including Constantinople III, three more ecumenical synods repeated the anathema against Honorius for heresy. Moreover, in the Roman Breviary, up until the 18th century, included a description of Honorius as a “heretic” for June 28th, the feast of the Pope who executed Honorius’s condemnation (St. Leo II). There also can be no question that these Councils, Popes, theologians, canonists, and general Christian thinkers understood Honorius as a heretic. Though, you have some exceptions.      One thing that Feser does not venture deeply into is the question of what kind of “heretical crime” was proven at the Council in 681 over Honorius, a man who had died 42 years prior to its convocation. At best, Honorius can be convicted of material heresy since the form added to the matter of heresy has to be proven. Moreover, since the doctrine of two-wills in Christ was not definitively settled, even a material heresy in this regard (according to Catholicism’s developed canon law) could not, of itself, situate one into the canonical crime of heresy nor the status of mortal sin. Otherwise, we would have to anathematize the person and memory of St Thomas Aquinas for his rejection of the Immaculate Conception. But that is impossible since Pope Sixtus condemned anyone who would accuse another for mortal sin or canonical heresy when the matter had not yet been resolved by the Apostolic See. While the Council of Constantinople III cannot be said to have worked with these parameters, those parameters did become standard and acceptable to Catholic canon law, jurisprudence, and pastoral theory. It is practical today.      What lessons, asks Feser, can be drawn from Honorius for us today? I think the most that can be drawn is that a Pope can commit a doctrinal error. But that a Pope could become teach heresy and thereby become a formal heretic is not illustrated by the Honorius-event. One might argue that the Honorius-event lends great precedent that such a thing could, in theory, happen. But there is nothing in the Honorius-event, according to developed Catholic beliefs on the nature of heresy and its criminality, that illustrates that precedent. Now, if we revert back to the standards of the Latin and Greek policies during the 7th century, then it is a foregone conclusion, a Pope can become a formal heretic. But it seems to me that we cannot ignore the canonical, theological, and pastoral developments that have taken place since Honorius to the present day.      For a more relevant historical context wherein a Pope committed an error while in office, coupling form and matter (but perhaps not pertinacity), you would have to study the Three Chapters controversy under Emperor Justinian regarding the Constituta of Pope Vigilius.      PS. For the life of me, when I read Honorius’s letters, my own private judgment does not see him as a true Monothelite.

2927,"The third problem with their response is that (i) the microstructural elements of the chair are _parts_ of the chair, but (ii) the parts of something plausibly cannot efficiently cause (i.e., actualize the existence of) their whole. Here are, briefly, three reasons why this is so. First, if we allow that parts of something can efficiently causally sustain their whole, then sustaining-cause-arguments could only get us to an unsustained, uncomposed component that sustains wholes—not a radically transcendent God who is decidedly _not_ a part of creation. Second, parts of wholes seem in some sense less fundamental than the wholes of which they are parts; plausibly, they’re only intelligible with reference to the substances they compose. Their existence _qua_ the things they are, then, presupposes the (ontologically) prior existence of the substance and hence cannot causally explain its existence. It seems that your arm cannot be the efficient cause of you, since its being _your_ arm in the first place presupposes _your existence_ as a substance. Third, it’s a component of Thomistic-Aristotelianism that parts of substances exist merely _virtually_ (and hence only in potency); but per the Aristotelian causal principle, only things existing in _actuality_ can causally actualize the existence of something else. (Cf. Feser (2014, p. 197) for the point about parts and virtual containment.) And while our final two points in this paragraph depend on Aristotelian views of substances, there is still value in bringing to light incompatibility between McNabb and DeVito’s rejoinder (on the one hand) and such Aristotelian views (on the other hand). For not only does Feser accept such views, but they are also rationally defensible—and to the extent that one finds them plausible, one has _pro tanto_ reason to reject McNabb and DeVito’s rejoinder.",third problem response microstructural element chair part chair ii part something plausibly efficiently cause ie actualize existence whole briefly three reason first allow part something efficiently causally sustain whole sustaining-cause-arguments could get u unsustained uncomposed component sustains wholes—not radically transcendent god decidedly part creation second part whole seem sense le fundamental whole part plausibly intelligible reference substance compose existence qua thing presupposes ontologically prior existence substance hence causally explain existence seems arm efficient cause since arm first place presupposes existence substance third component thomistic-aristotelianism part substance exist merely virtually hence potency per aristotelian causal principle thing existing actuality causally actualize existence something else cf feser p point part virtual containment final two point paragraph depend aristotelian view substance still value bringing light incompatibility mcnabb rejoinder one hand aristotelian view hand feser accept view also rationally defensible—and extent one find plausible one pro tanto reason reject mcnabb rejoinder,sceptic,1858,0

The evidence of the senses should be pretty certain and uncontroversial but if you, say, go to a bunch of people that were there during a discussion or even fight between two folks they care about, for instance, you find that sense evidence can be the origin of disagreement as well as metaphysics! If ideas matter to life, people will disagree.      Our boy Descartes is simply wrong, we don't need certain knowledge to be justified on our beliefs. Math deals with abstractions, so of course it will have a degree of agreement than areas that deal with real life do not, every step on the direction of particularity is a step away from certainty.

1076,"And also: I have quite explicitly said in previous posts that if there is a problem here, it has to do with the God's intention/reasons for X being the same as God's intention/reasons for ~X. That is a different issue which is only tangentially related with divine creative freedom - the actual problem there is with the multiplicity of divine ideas. I can grant (as I have granted before) that there can be an objection from the fact that prima facie in DS God's ideas would all be the same, but there should be a multiplicity, etc. This is something that strikes us as being quite different from how us humans think (and by extension, intend things).      This is not the problem of ""how could God freely cause different things in different worlds without any intrinsic differences in God between worlds???"". I have been very clear and precise in my comments that it is *this* that I think is a bad objection which would also affect LFW for humans, not just God. And I have explained why.      So, using the terms in our latest posts: if we are to assume these ""Wills"" as you want, they would have to not determine the action. Someone would have both the ""Will-to-X"" and the ""Will-to-not-X"" and then be able to indeterministically cause either X or ~X in that case. So there would be no intrinsic difference in the subject required for him to cause X or cause ~X in that situation. The same as God.      What you CAN object is that, differently from us, under DS in God the ""Will- to-X"" would be the same as the ""Will-to-not-X"" and you could think that this is absurd. But then as I said this is a different objection - it's basically the issue of the multiplicity of divine ideas, only tangentially related to free choice (if one thinks ideas are required for choices). The issues of ""5 is different than 2!"" etc. I have talked about this in my last reply to Vincent.

1013,"@Talmid      The same way classical theism and contingent knowledge go together. My open theism is based on the openness of the future (I agree with Pruss and many others that foreknowledge of free acts requires eternalism, but I am a presentist, so I reject foreknowledge of free acts). In other words: there is no difference at all in our views of God - I also believe that he must know every true fact. The difference between us is that I do not believe there are any true facts of what we will choose. Only what we choose or have chosen. So there is nothing for God to know there.      How can God ""learn"" what we choose without undergoing intrinsic change? The same way God can learn any contingent facts without undergoing intrinsic change. Classical theists believe God's knowledge of contingents is externalist and involves only Cambridge changes for him. You already have to believe that God's knowledge differs between worlds without that entailing any change in his intrinsic properties. Even with foreknowledge you have to believe that God only knows what you will do IFF God contingently creates you (unless you are a Molinist - which thomists reject - or you believe God creates of necessity). So you're on the same boat as me when it comes to having to account for God's contingent knowledge without real change. The only difference, again, is that I think there is nothing to know re: ""future choices"".      So no, open theism does not entail God being temporal.

In particular, it reflects the conviction that ultimate explanation is possible, that the world can be made intelligible through and through.

For if God cannot be boundless in love without creating the world, then creation _does_ add something to God – it _completes_ or _perfects_ his love. This entails that God _needs creation_ in order to be complete, perfect, unlimited, unbounded. And this is no less heretical than is the claim that God creates of necessity. Thus does the First Vatican Council [teach that](https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/first-vatican-council-1505) “there is one true and living God, creator and lord of heaven and earth, almighty, eternal, immeasurable, incomprehensible, **_infinite in_** will, understanding and **_every perfection_** ” (emphasis added).

3217,"But I don’t find this persuasive. Surely something might endure through time _not_ because it intrinsically changes but instead because it changes in _relation_ to _other_ things that intrinsically change. Even if time is the measure of change, this only implies that the existence of time entails that _there is some change or other_ ; it does _not_ imply that every entity that exists in time must _intrinsically_ change. Temporal reality could be such that (i) objects O1, O2, . . . On exist in time, (ii) one of the aforementioned Oi is intrinsically unchangeable, and (iii) time nevertheless exists (and passes) in virtue of the changes in objects _other than_ Oi (and to which, we can suppose, Oi relationally stands). And, crucially, Feser argues in his article that immutability is, indeed, compatible with extrinsic change. So Feser has failed to establish that immutability entails timelessness, since immutability is compatible with extrinsic change, and an entity can be temporal in virtue of extrinsically changing in relation to other things that intrinsically change. (E.g., a simple particle might be intrinsically changeless and yet nevertheless persist through time in virtue of standing in relations to _other_ things that _do_ intrinsically change.) Now, perhaps Feser will argue that being immutable is only compatible with extrinsically relational changes that _don’t_ temporalize their subjects. Perhaps, but then he owes us an _argument_ for this claim, as well as an account of what distinguishes extrinsic changes that _don’t_ temporalize from those that _do_.",find persuasive surely something might endure time intrinsically change instead change relation thing intrinsically change even time measure change implies existence time entail change imply every entity exists time must intrinsically change temporal reality could object exist time ii one aforementioned oi intrinsically unchangeable iii time nevertheless exists pass virtue change object oi suppose oi relationally stand crucially feser argues article immutability indeed compatible extrinsic change feser failed establish immutability entail timelessness since immutability compatible extrinsic change entity temporal virtue extrinsically changing relation thing intrinsically change eg simple particle might intrinsically changeless yet nevertheless persist time virtue standing relation thing intrinsically change perhaps feser argue immutable compatible extrinsically relational change temporalize subject perhaps owes u argument claim well account distinguishes extrinsic change temporalize,sceptic,1586,0

2569,"I have several replies. First, as we’ve seen, the inertialist need not accept the metaphysics underlying the argument. Setting that aside, though, let’s consider each premise in turn. One difficulty that arises with premises (1) and (2) is that prior to _anything’s_ existing, it is nothing. For if x were something _prior_ to its existence, then its existence would be prior to its existence, which is absurd. There is thus nothing special about essence- existence composites here—even prior to the existence of something in which essence and existence are identical, it is nothing. In that case, though, premise (2) would lead to conclusion that _nothing_ exists in virtue of what it is. For if (as premise (2) says) not existing in virtue of what x is _follows upon_ the fact that prior to x’s existence, x is nothing, then—since the latter is true of _everything_ —it follows that _nothing_ exists in virtue of what it is.

Justice may require such harsh punishments, but it may not necessarily. C.S. Lewis wrote on this in his book ""Mere Christianity,"" with the example of a man who cheats and lies his way through life without any consideration for others' welfare, and he challenges the reader not to have a desire that the flag should be planted in that rebellious soul, which is just a healthy manifestation of justice.

2120,"Melkman, you seem to be fusing two different issues: the first is the difference between material heresy and formal heresy. Material heresy is believing X when the Church has taught not-X. You can do this by merely NOT KNOWING that the Church has taught not-X. Formal heresy adds to the material heresy the necessary spiritual ingredient of holding the proposition X obstinately, in the face of the Church's teaching, being aware _that the Church teaches not-X_. This is the sin of heresy in its formal aspect.      Then there is another distinction, having the sin of heresy, versus the ecclesiastical crime of heresy. If you obstinately hold X, but _never tell or act on that belief_ , you could not be held guilty in a Church court for the ecclesiastical crime, because there would be no knowledge of the fact. So your heresy could become publicly declared. So it would not be ""formally"" determined heresy, by which you mean "" **officially** NAMED 'the sin of heresy' by the Church"".      And then there is the distinction between holding an X where the Church has taught not-X, but in which not-X is _not a formally defined dogma to be affirmed with Catholic faith, or a definitive teaching ""to be held"" unreservedly_ but a lesser position, taught (""merely"") as a firm tradition. While a Church court might find you guilty of some crime or other in publicly asserting X, it wouldn't necessarily be that of ""heresy"" as defined in the canons. For the latter, the teaching of not-X must be a definitive one, a teaching on which the Church has **definitively** resolved the debate. So, you could be found obstinately sinful in holding error, but not that of "" **formally defined** "" error.      Your point seems to be that even if the position stated by Honorius was actually material heresy, (a) maybe he wasn't guilty of the obstinacy necessary for the sin, and (b) nobody in the Church could have successfully carried out an ecclesiastical trial to _determine_ his guilty status so that it could be OFFICIALLY DECLARED to be ""heresy"" to all. erick below points out the additional issue that the true answer had not yet been defined.

2976,"In order to introduce relativistic conceptions of endurance and perdurance, we need to first place some conceptual machinery on the table. Following Gilmore (2008), we can define a binary locational predicate ‘is weakly located at’. For O to be weakly located at a space-time region R is for O to spatiotemporally overlap R, that is, for R to not be completely free of O. As Gilmore defines it, R is O’s _path_ just in case R “has a subregion in common with all and only those regions at which the object is weakly located” (2008, p. 1228). Or, as Calosi and Fano describe, “the path of an object is simply the union of its exact locations” (2015, p. 287). For the perdurantist, O’s path will turn out to be the space-time region occupied by O’s space-time worm, whereas for the endurantist, O’s path will turn out to be the mereological sum of all the space-time regions that O occupies throughout O’s life.",order introduce relativistic conception endurance perdurance need first place conceptual machinery table following gilmore define binary locational predicate ‘ weakly located weakly located space-time region r spatiotemporally overlap r r completely free gilmore defines r path case r “ subregion common region object weakly located ” p calosi fano describe “ path object simply union exact location ” p perdurantist path turn space-time region occupied space-time worm whereas endurantist path turn mereological sum space-time region occupies throughout life,sceptic,908,0

1985,"Second, as noted by John Chapman (whose book on Honorius I discussed in my previous post), the Church has long held that “an error which is not resisted is approved; a truth which is not defended is suppressed” (in the words of Honorius’s predecessor Pope Felix III). It is possible to be guilty of teaching doctrinal error by implication, when the context demands that a certain truth needs to be explicitly affirmed and instead one not only fails to do so but speaks in an ambiguous way that gives the appearance of approving the error. And that is exactly what Honorius did. The Monothelite error was being put forward, and he not only did not clearly condemn it but _seemed_ to be saying that it could be accepted. The suggestion that his words can be given a more charitable reading (as I agree they can) is relevant to his personal culpability, but it is not relevant to the question of the doctrinal soundness of the words themselves, and as Chapman emphasizes, in a context like this it is the words that matter.",second noted john chapman whose book honorius discussed previous post church long held “ error resisted approved truth defended suppressed ” word predecessor pope felix iii possible guilty teaching doctrinal error implication context demand certain truth need explicitly affirmed instead one fails speaks ambiguous way give appearance approving error exactly honorius monothelite error put forward clearly condemn seemed saying could accepted suggestion word given charitable reading agree relevant personal culpability relevant question doctrinal soundness word chapman emphasizes context like word matter,theist,1020,1

Because Aquinas’s disciples have created a million different schools of Thomism, and I have never been fussed about trying to sort through them all. This is mainly because these disciples start with an assumption that I cannot accept, and then interpret Aquinas accordingly. This is how disciples of Aquinas work. First, they start with the assumption that Aquinas cannot possibly be wrong about anything, and that he is never inconsistent with himself. Second, from this assumption, they will engage in all sorts of wild interpretative strategies to make Aquinas infallible.

2254,"Now, I sympathize with Chomsky’s view that the so-called hard problem of consciousness is a pseudo-problem. As I said in my exchange with Goff, I would say that the problem arises only if we follow Galileo and his early modern successors in holding that color, odor, sound, heat, cold, and other “secondary qualities” do not really exist in matter in the way common sense supposes them to, but instead exist only in the mind (as the qualia of conscious experience) and are projected by us onto external reality. If you take this position, you are stuck with a conception of matter that makes it impossible to regard consciousness as material. The solution, I would say, is simply not to go along with this assumption in the first place, but to return to the Aristotelian-Scholastic view the early moderns reacted against, and which is compatible with the commonsense view of matter. The so-called hard problem of consciousness then dissolves. As Chomsky’s remarks later in the discussion make clear, he would be sympathetic with part of this story (though not, I’m sure, with the neo-Aristotelian bit).",sympathize view so-called hard problem consciousness pseudo-problem said exchange goff would say problem arises follow galileo early modern successor holding color odor sound heat cold “ secondary quality ” really exist matter way common sense supposes instead exist mind qualia conscious experience projected u onto external reality take position stuck conception matter make impossible regard consciousness material solution would say simply go along assumption first place return aristotelian-scholastic view early modern reacted compatible commonsense view matter so-called hard problem consciousness dissolve remark later discussion make clear would sympathetic part story though sure neo-aristotelian bit,theist,1102,1

Granted, I give a long exegesis of Augustine, Boethius, Peter Lombard, Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, Jacob Arminius, and Paul Helm on this point in _The End of the Timeless God_. For example, I consider Augustine’s _The Trinity_ Book V, where Augustine is really worried about God changing in terms of “relationship title” like _lord_ and _creator_. Or consider Aquinas in _SCG_ Book II.12-14, where Aquinas is worried about God changing relationally. There Aquinas says that the relations “are not really in Him, and yet are predicated of Him, it remains that they are ascribed to Him _according only to our way of understanding_.” In this section, Aquinas is clear that the relations cannot be accidents in God because God does not have any accidents.

2127,"Tony, thank you for taking the time to read my posts. I am not clear on what issues you think I am fusing, but I THINK it is that i did not distinguish formal heresy from the ecclesiastical crime of heresy.      If I understand you correctly, I would say that my posts presume a case where a person does not consider his views to be heretical (as I would presume was the case with Honorius). I understand that a person could admit to knowing his view was heretical, and hold to it obstinately, and it be formal without ever being denounced by ecclesial authority.      So I accept that in principle the ecclesiastical crime of heresy and formal heresy are different. BUT, it seems to me that where a person does not take his view to be heretical, they basically conflate. The debate then would be whether a judgment by an authority is needed for us to discern whether or not they had sufficient basis to know the view was heretical. I THINK this might be where you and I disagree.      I would certainly acknowledge that one COULD be aware, in reality, that his view was heretical without such a judgment. But could anyone outside of the person himself sufficiently discern that? That is the question. My view would be that the only way we could know this definitively is if a judgment was made against the person, and he remained in his error.      And I think this then applies to the case of Honorius (BTW, elsewhere I noted Erick's point that there is the additional issue of no council having declared on monothelitism yet at the time of Honorius' letter, an additional wrinkle). I did state in places that I realize Feser was not addressing as such the distinction between formal and material heresy. I raise it to point out that in principle one could be anathematized on material heresy alone where that was not a clear understanding of this distinction, but such an anathema in retrospect is problematic. So that would prompt a further discussion as to given that the Church never later teaches anything not already implicitly supported by the defined deposit of faith, we must presume that those condemning Honorius would in fact be aware of something like material and formal heresy distinction, and still condemned him anyway.      My contention would be that we should not take their condemnation as proof that a pope could be guilty of teaching something sufficiently close to formal heresy, as I THINK you are suggesting. Rather, I would be inclined to do the reverse. Given that what the Church herself now implies (as I take it) about the relationship between formal heresy and the ecclesiastical crime of heresy (in cases where the person does not consider his view heretical), we can see that cases such as Honorius' prompted the need to develop the formal/material distinction more clearly. I think it is also fair to say that over time the Church has come to be procedurally more rigorous in understanding teachings to be DEFINITIVE only when formally pronounced in councils or ex catheda, even if we can contend that there can be infallible doctrine not so explicitly defined. But the ability to judge a person in relation to what they hold in such doctrines does in fact seem to differ when certain distinction and juridical procedures are more defined than they appear to have been in the time of Honorius' condemnation.",tony thank taking time read post clear issue think fusing think distinguish formal heresy ecclesiastical crime heresy understand correctly would say post presume case person consider view heretical would presume case honorius understand person could admit knowing view heretical hold obstinately formal without ever denounced ecclesial authority accept principle ecclesiastical crime heresy formal heresy different seems person take view heretical basically conflate debate would whether judgment authority needed u discern whether sufficient basis know view heretical think might disagree would certainly acknowledge one could aware reality view heretical without judgment could anyone outside person sufficiently discern question view would way could know definitively judgment made person remained error think applies case honorius btw elsewhere noted point additional issue council declared monothelitism yet time letter additional wrinkle state place realize feser addressing distinction formal material heresy raise point principle one could anathematized material heresy alone clear understanding distinction anathema retrospect problematic would prompt discussion given church never later teach anything already implicitly supported defined deposit faith must presume condemning honorius would fact aware something like material formal heresy distinction still condemned anyway contention would take condemnation proof pope could guilty teaching something sufficiently close formal heresy think suggesting rather would inclined reverse given church implies take relationship formal heresy ecclesiastical crime heresy case person consider view heretical see case prompted need develop formalmaterial distinction clearly think also fair say time church come procedurally rigorous understanding teaching definitive formally pronounced council ex catheda even contend infallible doctrine explicitly defined ability judge person relation hold doctrine fact seem differ certain distinction juridical procedure defined appear time condemnation,theist,3344,1

To understand the buddhist position I make an extreme amount of effort (due to how I felt every time I came in contact with it and due to the fact that I'm just a normal guy) and based myself on some works but most specifically: Jay L. Garfield ""engaging buddhism: why it matters to philosophy"" and Mark Siderits ""how things are: an introduction to buddhist metaphysics""      Things to notice about buddhism, in general, is the thesis that they subscribe to mereological nihilism, momentariness (nothing exists more than an instant), nominalism (or conceptualism depending on the 'school'), and what they call ""anti-substancehood"".      If someone is a philosopher (a true philosopher, not a continental one) I do recommend reading the Mark Siderits one since it is a defense of buddhist metaphysics positions in all its aspects (the book cover even says that it is ''buddhist philosophy for philosophers"", so let's commit the fallacy of authority here). So a literate philosopher (not some random guy like me) could see the full picture i.e how far can the arguments go in a necessary way and if they were to be coherent at all at the end of the day. Btw, Ed, I hope that you're reading this.      So, the major differences between their position and ours are that:      1 - they collapse the distinction of act and potency (e.g for something to exist is for it to ""keep producing"" its effects in some way continuously, they use the example of a sprout saying that if the sprout is permanent and not momentary it should keep producing its effect continuously).      2 - they take universals to be ""abstract"" and ""causally ineffective"". Their idea of causality resembles a lot a proto-humean one (like its some kind of idea of the mind conjoining things together).      3 - they do not even address the Aristotelian sense of substance at all and collapse its position with bare substrata. Since this is a ""serious charge"" I will quote a footnote from the Siderits book: ""I am here using “substance” in the Lockean sense of the “something know not what” that underlies and supports an object’s properties. This usage is common to both Aristotle and Nyāya."" (footnote 16, page 65 of the book I've mentioned above).

2017,"Well, I don't know that I can convince you, but:   The ""authority to teach"" has always been connected to Christ's ""he who hears you hears Me.""

And when the bishops, in their **ordinary** teachings, teach a truth that is also universally taught by the other bishops, **that** teaching is not only protected _somewhat_ (i.e. like the kind of protection over those teachings to which we owe religious submission), those teachings are infallible and we owe them unreserved assent. So, the bishops in exercising their _ordinary_ teaching office can at least touch on the higher protection, which _suggests_ that they also can touch on the lower protection afforded those teachings to which we owe religious assent - also in their ordinary exercise of their teaching office.

1038,"Walter      ""Of course there is a difference in my intrinsic properties between w1 and w2. Otherwise there is no reason why I choose X over ~X.   The cause of my choosing X in w1 is me with my intention to choose X, which is an intrinsic property.   You are describing a random process instead of a choice.""      No, Walter, there is no intrinsic difference if LFW is true, and this is precisely how there can be a libertarian free choice. Otherwise the presence of you + the intention would determine the resulting action and we would no longer have libertarian freedom. If the cause were you and the intention, then in order to preserve libertarian freedom you would have to cause your intention. But then to cause your intention you would end up in an infinite regress, unless you accept that you at t in state S can cause Intention (what it does in w1) or not cause it (what it does in w2). In other words: there is no difference in intrinsic properties in the agent in worlds 1 and 2, and yet the agent can cause X or ~X. See? That's my point.      There is literally no difference between humans and God when it comes to this weird aspect of libertarian freedom. For determinism to be avoided, it must be the case that someone at t in state S can cause both X or ~X. For our libertarian choice of X, there is a time t which is the earliest time with the property that after t it is no longer causally possible for us to choose ~X instead. How else do you think libertarian freedom could work, without determinism? If the choice follows a difference in intrinsic properties, then the choice would be determined by such a difference and thus would no longer be libertarian, lest we cause the difference in properties (the intention, say), but then the same problem would reappear.      You say that this is ""random"". That is a common accusation by those who *reject* libertarian freedom. I do not accept that it is random; I believe libertarian choice is a sui generis category that is neither random nor deterministic, but that is beside the point. My response was that the ""problem"" Vincent was pointing out doesn't just affect Divine Simplicity, but also libertarian freedom for humans. It is THE SAME THING for us. The issue there doesn't lie with classical theism, but LFW; LFW by itself requires that an agent can be able to (non-randomly) bring about different effects without there being any change in the intrinsic properties of the agent when it is choosing.      So if you have a problem with God choosing to cause different things without requiring any difference in intrinsic properties as a condition for that, you should also have a problem with libertarian freedom for humans. Which you probably do (you probably do not accept LFW). Vincent however does presumably accept LFW, so he has to choose between rejecting LFW altogether or dropping that objection.      The only difference between us and God in this case is you could argue that our intrinsic properties change *after* we have CHOSEN (not when we are choosING). But so what? It is not even clear to me that we must change intrinsically after we have chosen; why insist that this must happen universally, even with God? It would still be the case that for a libertarian free choice to be made, the cause need not incur in change, since the cause can indeed, under the same exact intrinsic properties, bring about different effects. So the objection against God's choosing is worthless.      One could go on to complain about God's contingent knowledge of what he in fact chose (again, a matter of what could change AFTER a choice), but that is a different objection - the one that pertains to God's contingent knowledge.

1317,"""and neither are any of God's perfections and human perfections.""      I disagree with that and you seem to be missing the point of analogy. Of course God is not perfectED but he nevertheless is *literally* perfect in the sense that he eminently possesses (eternally) all of the actualities that creatures come to possess when they are perfected. As I said, it has long been a standard thomistic view to say that God must *formally* possess all pure perfections. This is related to what names we can literally predicate of God with analogy. We don't say that God is wise just because God caused wisdom, just like we don't say God is a cat (though he is the cause of cats and hence has all of their actualities). Wisdom per se does not entail limitations, but on the contrary, an increase in being.      If you want to insist that this is no analogy of proper proportionality etc. and discuss terminology, nevertheless the metaphysical point remains that God must possess all of the actualities/perfections of its creatures (see ST I question 4 for instance), and hence be relevantly like a moral agent unless you think moral agency is intrinsically limiting.      Again, would you say that God is not intelligent? That God is not wise? That God is not free? Just because a perfection is found in a limited and creaturely manner in us, that does not mean it is not a pure perfection per se. The same goes for ""God is a moral agent"".      ""while the notion of moral is also rooted in the notion of custom (or more), which in turn is intrinsically (both conceptually and existentially) dependent upon a framework of human practices and institutions and corresponding ends and modes of excellence""      I completely disagree. To me, moral has to do with the necessary facts of ethics. ""Moral agency"" simply refers to the capacity of beings possessed with intellect and will (and hence freedom) to act in accordance with (or contrary to) the necessary moral facts (such as ""torturing people is wrong/evil""). God absolutely is a moral agent. Again, this has nothing to do with classical theism but rather with whether ""moral agent"" is a pure perfection or not.      And the point remains that when we attribute goodness, and moral goodness, to God (and we do; and in particular, Christian believers must do that) there must be some basic standards which God must fulfill, lest the attribution of goodness becomes equivocal. It would not do to say ""God is most wise!! Omniscient and perfectly knowing!"" and yet have God not actually knowing whether we exist or not. But if God does not care about the suffering of people (to the point where we could prima facie expect him to prevent or stop it) then this God is not ""good"". He might be ""good"" the way a squirrel that has all of its bodily parts is ""good"", but not good in the relevant sense that believers profess him to be - and would, again, strike many of us as a severely defective being (which should be impossible for the Purely Actual source of all existence and perfection). This is all that is needed to get the problem of evil going, however.      It amazes me how some people don't realize that the ""God is not a moral agent"" line not only is metaphysically problematic for many (again, it has to do with moral agency being a pure perfection or not, not with classical theism per se. There are also classical theists that deny there is knowledge in God, after all) but also only ""solves"" the problem of evil at the expense of making God unworthy of love and worship to most believers, as well as a severely defective and limited being to many metaphysicians.",neither perfection human perfection disagree seem missing point analogy course god perfected nevertheless literally perfect sense eminently posse eternally actuality creature come posse perfected said long standard thomistic view say god must formally posse pure perfection related name literally predicate god analogy say god wise god caused wisdom like say god cat though cause cat hence actuality wisdom per se entail limitation contrary increase want insist analogy proper proportionality etc discus terminology nevertheless metaphysical point remains god must posse actualitiesperfections creature see st question instance hence relevantly like moral agent unless think moral agency intrinsically limiting would say god intelligent god wise god free perfection found limited creaturely manner u mean pure perfection per se go god moral agent notion moral also rooted notion custom turn intrinsically conceptually existentially dependent upon framework human practice institution corresponding end mode excellence completely disagree moral necessary fact ethic moral agency simply refers capacity being possessed intellect hence freedom act accordance contrary necessary moral fact torturing people wrongevil god absolutely moral agent nothing classical theism rather whether moral agent pure perfection point remains attribute goodness moral goodness god particular christian believer must must basic standard god must fulfill lest attribution goodness becomes equivocal would say god wise omniscient perfectly knowing yet god actually knowing whether exist god care suffering people point could prima facie expect prevent stop god good might good way squirrel bodily part good good relevant sense believer profess - would strike many u severely defective impossible purely actual source existence perfection needed get problem evil going however amazes people realize god moral agent line metaphysically problematic many moral agency pure perfection classical theism per se also classical theist deny knowledge god also solves problem evil expense making god unworthy love worship believer well severely defective limited many metaphysicians,theist,3613,1

Eventually, he did clean up his act, but - as with all the saints - he attributed this to **favors he was granted out of God's overflowing gifts** , not out of his own merit.      ""and excelllence"". Again the ONLY excellence that technically qualifies is the **love of God** by which you act rightly in all your acts, and this is (again) always due to God's beneficent favor, not our own merit. All we can claim is to have _remained in cooperation_ with said grace, rather than repudiating it. St. Francis said that greater good would be found in a man merely picking a piece of straw out of the road, if done with perfect love of God, than in a great many great sacrifices suffered with imperfect love.      What you are confusing in ""excellences"" is the acts of HEROIC virtues by which the Church _locates and confirms canonized_ saints, with the actual excellence needed, perfect love. But the life of a nun in a contemplative cloister, who spends her entire life _just FOLLOWING THE RULE_ with perfect charity, (and without any call by God to endure situations demanding heroic virtue), has just as much claim on being in heaven as some highly acclaimed saint who performed many wonders and miracles with love of God, or a saint who bore great visible sufferings for love of God. The Church never _expects_ to canonize all those who go to heaven: she uses the test of heroic virtue as an empirical source of _evidence for_ the required love of God, but she does not deny the same love might persist in many who do not demonstrate it VISIBLY in great events.      And if you die in the state of grace but highly imperfect in your love of God, your time in Purgatory will correct that, and you will get to heaven with perfect love of God - just like the acclaimed and cannonized saints.",look around see actually good people people special ability excellence realizes unworthy heaven addition reply want focus notion first special ability never aspect qualified heaven take example st peter examine behavior gospel act find guy - mere fisherman - constantly put foot mouth berates god run away friend great need eventually clean act - saint - attributed favor granted overflowing gift merit excelllence excellence technically qualifies love god act rightly act always due beneficent favor merit claim remained cooperation said grace rather repudiating st francis said greater good would found man merely picking piece straw road done perfect love god great many great sacrifice suffered imperfect love confusing excellence act heroic virtue church locates confirms canonized saint actual excellence needed perfect love life nun contemplative cloister spends entire life following rule perfect charity without call god endure situation demanding heroic virtue much claim heaven highly acclaimed saint performed many wonder miracle love god saint bore great visible suffering love god church never expects canonize go heaven us test heroic virtue empirical source evidence required love god deny love might persist many demonstrate visibly great event die state grace highly imperfect love god time purgatory correct get heaven perfect love god - like acclaimed cannonized saint,theist,2316,1

1223,"I think people sometimes take original sin too much like a theory of physics. Once you do that it can lead to misunderstandings. Perhaps think of it instead as God creating nature with a telos, in fact a hierarchy of teloi, with everything drawn towards his divine idea(l)s (using Augustines terms). What the fall represents is us starting to choose our own sub-teloi, of having “knowledge” of what is “good” for us. Once we do the conscious choosing, we generally do a pretty bad job of it, as can be seen immediately with Cain, and that has consequences that ripple across everything. Like a stone thrown into a calm pond.      In order to recover our correct place in nature so that we can become participants in God’s original creation, working with him rather that towards our own faulty choice of sub-telos, we have to aim towards God’s original idea(l) of man.      Fortunately He has helped us hugely here. The incarnation was not just(!) the sacrifice that gained the reconciliation of the consequences of our bad choices, it also gave us the perfect example of the divine ideal we were created to be. So in choosing to be more like him, as far as we can in our puny efforts, we become participants in God’s great act of creation that is this universe (and we get help in this). On this path even the delights of the world become good, and we can have life to the full (though not without suffering yet).      If we don’t - but rather continue to create our own sub-teloi - then even good intentions can lead us away from completion, away from union with the creator. For those whose chosen teloi, their highest good and highest desires, are the base pleasures of the world, it is them who are choosing eternal torment. We are made to rest in Him, not in base things which will always bring their own suffering.

1650,"Right: it is Good's delight to spread good, not solely when and because it is ""owed"", but even where good is not owed. Thus, God's act of creation is spreading good where no good is owed - no thing _deserves_ to be granted existence, so for every thing, its existence is a gift to it.      And just as a good person can give goods to others where they are not owed, out of kindness, generosity, or mercy: so also a person can _relieve debt_ as a kind of gift to the person who owes. To show this more easily: if John owes me $100, and Bill kindly pays John's debt to me, I am paid off, and John no longer owes me. If Bill does this as a gift, nobody is HURT and my debt is satisfied.      Similarly, if I decide to ""pay off"" John's debt to me by considering it paid, I make a gift to John like Bill does above. Gifts are not **contrary** to justice, they are BESIDE it. It's just that I am both the giver and the one whose receivable is ""paid off"" by my gift.      For moral wrongs, we cannot forgive the part of the wrong that lies in the _sin against God_ , because that is a debt owed toward God, not us. But we can forgive the part that is owed to us.      Broadly speaking, it may be either prudent or imprudent to easily forgive some debts against us: too easily forgiving money debts could cause some people to become spendthrifts and wastrels. Similarly, too readily forgiving _offenses_ against us might have a similar result. But aside from that measure of prudence, Christ tells us to be willing to forgive any and all offenses against ourselves, and indeed the examples of both Christ and the saints shows them forgiving persecutors right in the midst of those acts of persecution - where clearly no remorse exists.      Perhaps someone can clarify distinctions about granting forgiveness of the _offense_ (qua guilt) while not relieving the debt of some kind of restitution? That, it seems, is part of what Oktavian is raising.",right delight spread good solely owed even good owed thus act creation spreading good good owed - thing deserves granted existence every thing existence gift good person give good others owed kindness generosity mercy also person relieve debt kind gift person owes show easily john owes bill kindly pay debt paid john longer owes bill gift nobody hurt debt satisfied similarly decide pay debt considering paid make gift john like bill gift contrary justice beside giver one whose receivable paid gift moral wrong forgive part wrong lie sin god debt owed toward god u forgive part owed u broadly speaking may either prudent imprudent easily forgive debt u easily forgiving money debt could cause people become spendthrift wastrel similarly readily forgiving offense u might similar result aside measure prudence christ tell u willing forgive offense indeed example christ saint show forgiving persecutor right midst act persecution - clearly remorse exists perhaps someone clarify distinction granting forgiveness offense qua guilt relieving debt kind restitution seems part oktavian raising,theist,1940,1

But we have trouble seeing how this will ultimately work out for another reason. The points on a Cauchy surface are space-like related. For that reason, no signal can propagate between numerically distinct points on a Cauchy surface. And since causes presumably make some difference to their effects, a signal must propagate from cause to effect. (Here, we mean ‘signal’ to be general enough that the cause, itself, might be the signal that reaches the effect.) For the sake of simplicity, suppose that O is a point-like particle and that t is O’s proper time. The only entities that can transmit a signal to O are located in O’s past light cone. Supposing that O-at-t does not cause O’s persistence at t, whatever substance causes O to persist at t must be located in O’s past light cone. Therefore, if the cause of O’s persistence has a location in O’s proper time and we disregard the possibility of retrocausation, the cause of O’s persistence must be located in O’s absolute past. This argument can be generalized to cases where O is not a point-like object by considering O as a collection of point-like objects.",one could try rescue mumford account assuming space- time globally hyperbolic defining concurrence term co- existence appropriate cauchy surface trouble seeing ultimately work another reason point cauchy surface space-like related reason signal propagate numerically distinct point cauchy surface since cause presumably make difference effect signal must propagate cause effect mean ‘ signal general enough cause might signal reach effect sake simplicity suppose point-like particle proper time entity transmit signal located past light cone supposing o-at-t cause persistence whatever substance cause persist must located past light cone therefore cause persistence location proper time disregard possibility retrocausation cause persistence must located absolute past argument generalized case point-like object considering collection point-like object,sceptic,1314,0

Tendency-disposition accounts, for instance, neither require nor entail that existence becomes part of something’s nature. They only need a tendency or disposition in conjunction with certain manifestation conditions. Similarly, no-change accounts do not require that existence becomes part of something’s nature. They only need an understanding of existence as a state/condition of unchangingness in conjunction with a claim about the nature of such states/conditions. Propositional necessity accounts say or entail nothing about existence’s becoming built into the nature of things; all they require is a primitive commitment to the metaphysical necessity of EIT. Objectual necessity accounts, likewise, have nothing to do with existence’s becoming ‘built into’ natures of things. Instead, necessary existence is (in some sense) built into one or more foundational concrete objects, and these objects go on to continuously explain (whether by grounding, realization, causation, or constitution) non- foundational temporal things.

Existential inertia debates are fundamentally concerned with ontological dependence, i.e., x’s ontologically depending on the concurrent or simultaneous existence or activity of y (at any moment at which x exists), such that x would instantly cease to exist the moment the explanatory dependence relation to y ceased to obtain. The relation, then, is a kind of sustenance or conservation. Note, finally, that I take ontological dependence to be a relation among _concreta_ (and/or the activities, properties, parts, etc. of concreta).",still taxonomic question concern kind ontological dependence denied inertially persistent object use it—and bearing mind rough approximation—x ontologically depends case extramental explanatory relation eg causing grounding realizing explanans x explanandum x would exist x standing explanatory dependence relation say ceased exist longer engaged relevant activity whatever existential inertia debate fundamentally concerned ontological dependence ie ontologically depending concurrent simultaneous existence activity moment x exists x would instantly cease exist moment explanatory dependence relation ceased obtain relation kind sustenance conservation note finally take ontological dependence relation among concreta andor activity property part etc concreta,sceptic,1099,0

Because for materialists in the technical sense - if they are to be coherent at all - they should say that people do not exist. But in the buddhist sense, not only people do not exist and there is just suffering but the world is always trying to deceive you. I don't need to canvas it more for you to see how much worse it is. There is simply no happiness at all and no one to see any good of it. It seems that ideology takes all of the best in the world and turn it into misery.      In the cellphone example, they somehow believe in regularities but, as far as I understand, they are very close to the Humean causality type - or proto- humean. They say that causality is in some sense mind only or something we 'associate' but it's in some sense not really there (I think that's somehow related to why they are nominalists too). If this is coherent at the end of the day (I think that it's not) is another story - and that's what I want to know because something as evil as that CAN'T BE REAL.      During these years I tried to formulate ways in showing how that can't be true - I will put them in the other post. But man the problem is even if I somehow 'showed' that, I can't prove it to myself. You may think how that's possible but the problem is the OCD - this thing keeps hitting my head 24/7 and it seems that I can't go further. Since you don't have it I can describe that it hits differently. Looks like my arguments are always wrong or that they will have somehow a way to evade it. For people that do not have it, it seems ridiculous, but for me, it hits really hard to the point that doesn't matter how I try to formulate it, and I always forget the rest of the arguments and need to repeat them to myself. It looks like hell because I'm never out of the same place and looks like I learn nothing - just keep suffering.

So, that makes every attempt to use logic to argue for God completely futile.""      I have not ""admitted"" anything.      An infinite random sequence such as I have described is just a limited model of simplicity that is also, in some sense, about something that is not known or accessible, or understood by someone. Applied to my free will, it would not mean that my free will choices are not ordered to anything. It means, assuming its validity, that whatever process I use to arrive at a decision is beyond your ability to know, understand, or predict, using whatever measurement or calculation you care to try.      I don't use logic to argue for the existence of God, at least not logic alone. I use observation. I open my eyes and see what God has made as in Romans 1:20. The logic part starts with an assumption: ""There must be a simple unifying cause of all of creation"". What we know as ""science"" cannot fill the role of logic in the argument. Science is not remotely simple, but is highly complex. The simpler explanation, we call God. It is, in fact, a definition.      ""If, given a finite amount of time, I will arrive at a point when death ends the process, then it is simply a matter of random chance.""      No, my free will choice is random to you, not to me. You cannot understand how I choose or predict what I will choose, but that does not make my choice disordered. It just means that you cannot understand or predict it. You do not just ""happen"" to be a theist or an atheist when you die. Your intellectual part, private as described (the reason for modelling it as random), directs your free will (it can still deliberately choose wrongly), but such a deliberate wrong choice turns you from God, where you will stay if you die in refusal. Your knowledge of the love of God plays a role in the choice, but you freely make it.      ""it seems that God has waited just long enough for the first time Adam did something wrong to condemn him""      God did not condemn Adam or anyone else.      ""since he was the one who put the sequence there in the first place, He knew exactly what was going to happen and when it was going to happen""      The sequence is just a model of unpredictable simplicity. It is not an ordering of creation.      ""Adam, just like the rest of us, was always doomed and has always been in need of redemption.

1234,"@Talmid. Well said. As an ex-atheist, I know that whether you believe in God as the ground of being (as all real believers do), versus considering Him as “a being” (as most atheists do) affects so much of your perspective. It’s not a fact among other facts. The reality is more like our understanding is a wall, with boxed up bricks of conclusions. As humans we find it difficult to look at the contents of more than one brick at a time. From an evolutionary perspective this is understandable. When you need food, or there is a lion at the cave entrance, you don’t want to be thinking about ways to make clothes, how the sun moves through the sky etc. In the modern world the foundations of the wall tend to be physics, chemistry, maths, geology, economics, politics etc, which themselves have foundations built on a reduction to small things (pebbles). Once you believe in God, that is always the foundation stone. To me this is why literalist, fundamentalist protestants have such a problem with science, but that’s a different subject. However it’s also why people find the conversion experience so shocking, as you realise your wall of understanding is in many cases upside down.

1031,"A rather lively discussion concerning LFW which has long been lacking with respect to divine freedom (and to a more indirect extent, modal collapse).      @RunDec @Walter      As far as I can tell, there has been a hidden assumption about event causation here: namely ""choose x"" is some event then leading to ""x occurs"". That is completely wrong, in that it would destroy the unity of an action and would lead to a vicious regress regarding volition. Rather ""choose x"" and ""x occurs"" is a simultaneous causal relationship of an action of a volitional agent.      A better description of LFW here (in its most bare bones form as self- generated action; deliberation is a type of it) is not so much in weighing scales, but something like picking a point on a circle: namely, insofar as the formula of a circle only provides an undifferentiated sea of possibles but no actual ones, I have to actualize some particular point, and prior to that actualization, the point is just a mere possible, not something with an individual actual reality; it cannot even be considered of itself a true individual reality apart from my actualization.      You could say that relies on a dubious notion of an infinity of options, but the basic idea does not change even for finite options. Suppose I have C = {X, Y}. C taken of itself is just an undifferentiated sea of possibles, to get X I would need C[0] while for Y I would need C[1]. That caused ""indexing"" is just what a self-determined action is. Since that ""indexing"" is not prior to the action but simultaneous with it, it is self-determined and free; nor is it some random ""coin flip"" because the 0ing and 1ing are not some earlier floating states (which would also generate a vicious regress as above) but coincident with the volition itself. In fact, it is more accurate to describe ""0ing"" and ""1ing"" as descriptions of self-determinations, not as ""things"".

967,"Kant was one of the world's greatest thinkers. He phillosophy foresaw quantum mechanics.      Kant did not view things-in-themselves as containing the sum of all possibilities, and phenomena all actualities; but this duality is conformable to Kant's metaphysics as to none other. As a contribution to the metaphysics of possibility, the quantum mechanical wave function can easily be seen as complementary to Kant's idea of things-in-themselves, where various kinds of things can happen (like free will) that are not comprehensible in terms of phenomenal reality. Kant would just have to allow that characteristics of physical reality can intrude some depth into things-in-themselves, which he would not have considered -- though we can also handle this by positing an intermediate level of reality, between true unconditioned things-in-themselves and true discrete phenomenal objects -- as Kant otherwise actually does himself for space and time as ""pure intuitions."" The wave function straddles the classic Kantian boundary, sharing some properties with phenomena, others, as underlying phenomena, with things-in-themselves.      Thus, where Kant would have considered all of phenomena governed by determinism, we now see the wave function as deterministic, while the collapse of waves into particles is random. Although chance in quantum mechanics has often been argued as allowing for free will, a free cause is still a very different thing from a random cause, which doesn't need mind or self or intention. Moral freedom is thus still left among things-in-themselves. Kant himself would have had difficulty placing randomness in his ontology, if he, like Hume, believed that chance violates determinism. Since chance is now part of the physics, it cannot be denied; but it also still remains a different matter from purposive freedom.      Kant's idea that space and time do not exist among things-in-themselves has been curiously affirmed by Relativity and quantum mechanics. In Relativity, time simply ceases to pass at the velocity of light: for photons that have travelled to us as part of the Cosmic Background Radiation, time has stood still for most of the history of the universe. On the other hand, quantum mechanics now posits ""non-locality,"" i.e. physical distances, and so the limitation of the velocity of light in Relativity, don't seem to exist. This means that although time may apply to the wave function, space may not. The full empirical reality of space is only found among discrete particles and objects.      This curious result is the consequence of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Paradox, which was intended by Einstein as a reductio ad absurdum of quantum mechanics. If, for instance, a positron and an election are both created from an energetic photon, the conservation of angular momentum requires that one be spinning one way, and the other the other. But the complementary spins are equally probable for each particle. Thus, in quantum mechanical terms, the wave functions of each particle divide without a discrete state being determined. The particles might then separate to even cosmological distances, but as soon as the spin of one particle is observed, the other particle must have the opposite spin, which means that the wave function has collapsed across those cosmological distances and caused the other particle to assume a predictable spin. If this occurs instantaneously, it would violate the limitation of the velocity of light in Special Relativity.      This has now been shown to actually occur on the basis of Bell's Theorem (from John Bell, 1928-1990), meaning that Quantum Mechanics does violate Special Relativity by allowing instantaneous interactions across even cosmological distances. However, once observed, processes must still obey Special Relativity and the limitations of spatial distance, creating the kind of duality described by Kant.

For temporal concrete object O to _fail_ to exist at t despite existing from [t*, t), where t* < t, is for some _change_ to occur.[31] But, plausibly, a change occurs only if some factor causally induces said change. It’s not as though a raging tiger, or thousands of photons, or whatever could just spring uncausedly into existence in this room right now; that would require some cause.[32] Moreover, it’s not like New York, or my house, or this article could pop out of existence uncausedly; such changes would require some cause. From this observation it follows that if no factor causally induces a change, then the change won’t occur. Thus, if no factor causally induces O to fail to exist at t despite existing from [t*, t), then O exists at t. Once we add that nothing came along to causally induce this—that is, once we add that nothing came along to destroy O from t* to t—it simply follows that O exists at t.

2003,"How is it possible to be an consecrated a bishop and then teach but not teach under the auspices of your being a bishop, i.e. ""teacher""? If you are made a teacher, and you teach, you are exercising your ""teacher"" role.      But the _bindingness_ of bishops' teachings varies in degree, according to the manner in which they propose them to us ""to be held"". Some they assert with great force and definitude, with explicit reference to this being something taught by the Church from time immemorial. Others they teach less definitely, but still ""with authority"". Others again they teach very mildly, but still as something they want us to accept. These are all _teachings_ and therefore they must be received by us, _in accord with the MANNER in which they were proposed to be received._ There are infinitely many degrees in which their teachings require assent from us, as is the infinitely many degrees of the teachings being taught with an expectation of being received.      It is when a bishop, either by venue, by context, or by clear mention, indicates that he is merely speculating or indulging in pious but uncertain considerations, that he is not asking for our assent as such. When he says things like ""well, _it seems to me_ "", or ""in my personal opinion,"" or ""I feel that X, but others may feel differently"" he is indicating room for dissent by others.      But note also that the venue is not WHOLLY determinative: in an encyclical, a pope might state a new idea that is his own personal view but is still uncertain, and also re-state a time-honored and universally approved teaching. The fact that the venue is _capable_ of teaching high and _strongly_ authoritative statements (and is the normal venue for doing so) does not mean every word in the encyclical bears that degree.

1301,"@Talmid: My condition for the “necessary” is ‘in order to achieve God’s plan’. We can of course only see that very dimly indeed, but it’s clear that the “new heaven and earth” will be more like the creation that people who reject God because of theodicy issues would expect of a good God. No more working in vain, no more pain of witnessing your children's misfortune. The wolf and the lamb eat together, even the lion no longer eats other creatures. So it seems clear to me from revelation that these things are a necessary phase of creation. When God creates he says it’s “good”, even though He knew it would contain elements that would not be part of the second creation. Once we were consciously able to choose between Him and not-Him, we often chose the latter. However it’s in making this choice correctly when it’s not obvious or easy that we ‘grow up’, as in we become as our Father intended.      Now I agree with you that we can imagine universes where we would be free and where we could easily see what is right, where there is no suffering of us or others to make us ‘loose heart’, and where there are no bright and shiny false lights with temporary excitement and pleasure. However, like the vines planted in good, loamy soil, which produce great big bunches of grapes but poor wine, there is clearly a need for us to struggle a bit in an apparently sub optimal environment for the creation process to have a successful end point. How God knows that, we cannot know. Did He tune creation like a quantum experiment, with all possible realities happening, and from eternity selected the one that worked best? Or did He just know, because He is infinite and absolute in all things? I suspect the latter, but the point is that we see a very small part of the creation process.

But his possession of being cannot be caused by the principles of his nature, e.g. his _forma substantialis_ [i.e., substantial form] ( _a_ ). The possession of _esse_ is the absolutely prior condition of the possibility of the causal and explanatory efficacy of these principles of nature.

It follows therefore that he must receive his existence from something else ( _b_ ) in which there is no distinction between essence and existence.

The idea is, first, that a hypothesis is a tentative explanation of some empirical event that will occur _under certain conditions_. Hence, suppose some effect _E_ occurs under certain conditions of type _T_. We might hypothesize that a cause of type _C_ is responsible, and then go on to test this by bringing about an instance of _C_ under conditions of type _T_ and seeing whether an instance of _E_ follows. If it does not, we might form some new hypothesis, to the effect that it is another sort of cause (of type _D_ , say) that is responsible. But even if our prediction is confirmed, it is possible in principle that it is nevertheless not really _C_ that is producing _E_ , but some other causal factor that is merely correlated with _C_. So we’d need to do further testing to rule that possibility out. And in any event, if there really is some causal connection between _C_ and _E_ , only such empirical investigation is going to reveal it, because the causal relationship between them, even if real, is going to be _contingent_. Again, it will be _possible_ that something other than _C_ is the cause, so that the most that further testing can do is render this supposition _improbable_ (even if, perhaps, _highly_ improbable).",citing work scholastic tradition reflect point view approach matter particular issue think account differs relevant way average non-scholastic philosopher scientist would say idea first hypothesis tentative explanation empirical event occur certain condition hence suppose effect e occurs certain condition type might hypothesize cause type c responsible go test bringing instance c condition type seeing whether instance e follows might form new hypothesis effect another sort cause type say responsible even prediction confirmed possible principle nevertheless really c producing e causal factor merely correlated c need testing rule possibility event really causal connection c e empirical investigation going reveal causal relationship even real going contingent possible something c cause testing render supposition improbable even perhaps highly improbable,theist,1534,1

1670,"@Tadeo      Hi! You offered a good description of these buddhists and pointed out some true problems with it. I just would notice that the momentariness thesis is not necessarily what all buddhists defend, Nagarjuna argued against it. A argument of his i remember:      if things last for a moment and them are gone would not this triple process of start existing-acting-ceasing to be generate a infinite regress? The existing action itself would have a start existing-acting- ceasing to be process and so its three parts, and the start of this process would have one as well and... you know that this does not ends, quite a good reading(but only read Nagarjuna with commentaries!)      Also: if Nagarjuna is my reference again his principal reason for negating substances existence would be that he conceptualize substance as the indian Atman: something unchanging, and did not accept that a substance and its acidents could be diferent while the acidents depended on the substance(for him, either you do not depend on the other thing at all, like a man and his girlfriend, or there is just 1 and not 2 things). Aristotle was needed there.      And my principal problem with any buddhist worth the name: how exactly things change orderly if there is no substance ordering acidents? Why the color acidents aways generate the visual perception and not a auditory one or pain? Saying that things act on law-like patterns is just to describe things; there is no explanation at all.      This position fails to explain evdn the continuity of my supposed illusions.

Now, this apparent contradiction gives us reason to think Gel is _not_ using “indiscernibility” in the aforementioned sense.

That is, there are anti-Humean accounts of laws, according to which there _are_ necessary connections between distinct existences. Anti-Humean accounts of laws are united not only by their denial of Humean Supervenience, but also by the modal status that they assign to laws. Lewis held to the free recombination principle. The free recombination principle is a principle about how the space of metaphysically possible worlds can be formally constructed. Roughly, Lewis held that, given two numerically distinct possible worlds W1 and W2, a third world W3 can be generated by conjoining space-time regions from W1 and W2. (Caveats need to be deployed about the two regions having, e.g., geometrically and topologically compatible boundaries.) If, contrary to Lewis, we accept that there are necessary connections between distinct existences, then the necessary connections will constrain both the space of metaphysically possible worlds (e.g., perhaps, given the nature of fire, there is no possible world where fire exists and fire fails to burn) and the relations between worlds (e.g., given the elevated status that laws enjoy on anti-Humean accounts, nearby possible worlds will be those where the laws are satisfied).",friend humean supervenience would say classical standard metaphysical explanation alien project rate inappropriate another account law classical objection applied anti-humean account law according necessary connection distinct existence anti-humean account law united denial humean supervenience also modal status assign law lewis held free recombination principle free recombination principle principle space metaphysically possible world formally constructed roughly lewis held given two numerically distinct possible world w w third world w generated conjoining space-time region w w caveat need deployed two region eg geometrically topologically compatible boundary contrary lewis accept necessary connection distinct existence necessary connection constrain space metaphysically possible world eg perhaps given nature fire possible world fire exists fire fails burn relation world eg given elevated status law enjoy anti-humean account nearby possible world law satisfied,sceptic,1492,0

2204,"@Uncommon Descent      I don't think you have understood the account of charity given in this post. Charity or love is to will the good of another person. This is the highest call of the Christian and a fulfilment of the entire law. We are called to love God above all things and to love our neighbor as ourselves. It is in this that Christians reflect the image of God who is love itself. It is in this that we show the Spirit of love dwelling within us as ""the love of God is poured into [our] hearts through the Holy Spirit who is given to us"" (Rom 5:5). It is this love that causes us to obey Christ's commands as Jesus taught ""If you love me you will keep my commands"" (John 14:15). The significance of this love for our salvation is that ""Christ is the source of eternal salvation for those who obey Him"" Hebrews 5:9).      This love is even greater than faith (1 Cor 13). Even with faith to move mountains, without love we are nothing (1 Cor 13). It is this love that causes our faith to work as what counts is ""faith working through love"" (Gal 5:6).      Again, this is the entire law: to love God and to love neighbor as oneself. Such love is reflected in the 10 commandments with the first 3 being about loving God and the second 7 being about loving neighbor. It is for this reason that Jesus responded to the rich young ruler's question (""what must I do to be saved?"") by quoting the commandments and then calling him to an act of love for the poor. It is for this reason that Jesus will separate the sheep and the goats based on whether or not they cared for those without clothes, food, and those imprisoned. We will be judged in the end on whether or not love dwells within us. As God is love itself and this love it poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, it is this love by which we ""remain in Christ"" as branches remain in the vine. This occurs when we love even our enemies as Christ calls us to do.      This does not mean that we never correct our enemies or rebuke them. Rebuking a sinner to stop sinning is an act of love. It is a work of mercy. So is instructing those that are ignorant. The key point in the post above is that we should not easily default into thinking that those who disagree with us are malicious. Having that as a default approach is neither reasonable nor charitable and given the centrality of both charity and truth in the Christian life, such an approach is not a Christian approach to discourse.",uncommon descent think understood account charity given post charity love good another person highest call christian fulfilment entire law called love god thing love neighbor christian reflect image god love show spirit love dwelling within u love god poured heart holy spirit given u rom love cause u obey command jesus taught love keep command john significance love salvation christ source eternal salvation obey hebrew love even greater faith cor even faith move mountain without love nothing cor love cause faith work count faith working love gal entire law love god love neighbor oneself love reflected commandment first loving god second loving neighbor reason jesus responded rich young question must saved quoting commandment calling act love poor reason jesus separate sheep goat based whether cared without clothes food imprisoned judged end whether love dwells within u god love love poured heart holy spirit love remain christ branch remain vine occurs love even enemy christ call u mean never correct enemy rebuke rebuking sinner stop sinning act love work mercy instructing ignorant key point post easily default thinking disagree u malicious default approach neither reasonable charitable given centrality charity truth christian life approach christian approach discourse,theist,2453,1

1630,"I have never heard of any **authoritative** assertion that an abused wife _should_ stay with the husband, and especially not say it as if it represented a rule. Adrian Fonseca is just a news & commentary purveyor, has no authority to hold forth on ""a teaching"". So, absent any new datum, it's ""just some guy bloviating"". Like me, here.      The Chrisitan doctrine on suffering is multi-layered, and should not be reduced to a simple sentence. That said, 4 points are at the heart: (1) not all suffering can be avoided while staying on the right side of the line of good action. (2) When suffering _can_ be avoided by a morally licit choice, it is often prudent (i.e. good, right action) to so. (3) In spite of (2), there are ALSO many situations where some part of suffering can be avoided, but willingly taking on and accepting the suffering (taking the suffering yourself, not subjecting another to the suffering) can be spiritually valuable, and **in general** a good Christian should expect to accept AT LEAST SOME avoidable suffering along his life. (4) Accepting avoidable suffering is _never_ done for its own sake, and therefore it can generally be accounted as being accepted for some other thing, a good that (will) more than offset the evil suffered. This is not intrinsically different from doing (troublesome) exercise to make the body (and soul) stronger - and there is little debate about that kind of ""accepting suffering"".      Infinite_Growth appears to be a moral toddler who has just discovered the word ""no"". Indeed, there is much room for growth.      So to apply: there is no possible one-size-fits-all rule for abused women. For some few (if the abuse is not severe), maybe they can achieve more good in the long run by staying. Maybe. For others, they have few or no real alternatives.

Could it be we are all deficient as to our brains and withou that, we would all have IQs of 200?""      It will depend on the school, but most dualists i can think of can account for this.      Take for instance the more platonic/dharmic/spiritist view that the soul is a substance whose nature is other than the body and that not only has no necessary conection with it but is actually weakened by being stuck with it. This is pretty straightfoward here: the soul is stuck with the body limitations and so its natural capacities will be worser on a crappier body.      Take now the cartesian view were the soul is a substance whose nature is other than the body but is made to function with the body. Here the sould and the body must function together to it to work well, so a bad body will make the soul less capable of functioning.      Now take the thomistic view were the soul is the form of the body. Here things also work well, for the body is responsable for sense data, memory and imagination and the intellect(that the soul is responsable for) needs sense data everytime it needs to function*, so if the body do not work well, them the sould is screwed.      So it seems that the forms of dualism defended by philosophers, at least with a religious mindset, can work well on this case. The only type of dualism i can't see explaining it is the one you see on most fiction with superhumans or magic were someone can turn into a fly or a bird, say, and still think.

His answer was that we can know some truths about how we happen to organize sense data by analysing the necessary conditions to our experience to it to be how it is. For instance, every experience we have is in time, it has a sucession and all that, so we can derive several truths about that(inded, mathematics would have his origin on the forms of time and space).

2675,"The first response to this proposal is that their cessation of existence is not the robust kind required by CTST, since the heavy elements do not, along with their parts, instantaneously annihilate. Second, recall that EIT only quantifies over temporal concrete objects _or some subset thereof_. Hence, even if spontaneously decaying particles do not inertially persist, this does nothing to refute EIT. Third, the facts concerning the cessation of existence of such elements are fully consistent with EIT. This is because such quick cessations of existence are not utterly inexplicable (for that would destroy the possibility of their scientific study!). Rather, they are _caused_ to cease to exist, either by their intrinsic nature/character or by environmental conditions unconducive to their perpetuation. But that means such elements are not counterexamples to EIT, since they could easily be such that they persist of their own accord for that short span of time and are interrupted in such persistence by sufficiently destructive internal or external causal factors.",first response proposal cessation existence robust kind required ctst since heavy element along part instantaneously annihilate second recall eit quantifies temporal concrete object subset thereof hence even spontaneously decaying particle inertially persist nothing refute eit third fact concerning cessation existence element fully consistent eit quick cessation existence utterly inexplicable would destroy possibility scientific study rather caused cease exist either intrinsic naturecharacter environmental condition unconducive perpetuation mean element counterexample eit since could easily persist accord short span time interrupted persistence sufficiently destructive internal external causal factor,sceptic,1073,0

3129,"Here’s another way to think about it. Consider again the case of mechanical inertia. One of Feser’s reconciliations of CP with mechanical inertia is to treat uniform rectilinear spatial motion as a mere state or condition of unchangingness. In this way, it does not involve the kind of dynamism that CP says requires a distinct actualizing cause. But when an object is uniformly rectilinearly moving through space, it may be undergoing _other_ , continuous processes of real change. These would—granting the truth of CP—require a continuously operative actualizing cause. But this does not negate or nullify the fact that the object is still in a state or condition of unchangingness w _ith respect to its uniform rectilinear motion_. And so, in _this_ respect, the object does not require a continuously operative cause, though the _other_ respects in which the object _is_ really changing _do_ (or would). And this is precisely the proposal of no-change accounts: although the object may be undergoing a host of real accidental changes (and thus may require continuous causes of such changes), the object is _not_ undergoing the kind of real dynamism or change _in respect of its actuality or existence_ that would require a continuously operative sustaining cause.",here another way think consider case mechanical inertia one reconciliation cp mechanical inertia treat uniform rectilinear spatial motion mere state condition unchangingness way involve kind dynamism cp say requires distinct actualizing cause object uniformly rectilinearly moving space may undergoing continuous process real change would—granting truth cp—require continuously operative actualizing cause negate nullify fact object still state condition unchangingness w ith respect uniform rectilinear motion respect object require continuously operative cause though respect object really changing would precisely proposal no-change account although object may undergoing host real accidental change thus may require continuous cause change object undergoing kind real dynamism change respect actuality existence would require continuously operative sustaining cause,sceptic,1267,0
1747,"(I will continue)      And to be fair, this all has to do with the doctrine of momentariness (and once again, read the chapter 4 from the Siderits book I've just mentioned or the Jay Garfield one, which has a chapter just for that).      But it's important though that for buddhists things have no motion since motion would imply substances or something that survives. And that's where I collapse because I'm not so good in A-T meta to explain all the problems with the argument that Siderits sets out in the book. Unfortunately - but sincerely - I can only feel that something is very wrong (and I'm not proud of not pointing out what is it). But I can at least think that is by making seriously controversial claims like ""things produce their effects and them go out of existence"" that the argument supposedly has some weight. But even if that's so, it's not clear that that could not be interpreted as an ephemeral substance (the ones that Ed exemplifies when talking about when explaining prime matter in Scholastic's Meta) for example.      But one thing that puzzles me a lot about buddhism - without even mentioning their purported attempt to show that they are ""not eliminativists"" about persons, but that persons just are ""useful fictions"". Is how they square to the fact from impermanence of all phenomena with things like semantics, language, or words. After all, they wrote a book arguing that people do not exist (or exist just conventionally because nothing lasts for more than a moment) exactly in a language that exist (with modifications, of course) since the 5th century i.e English. And that's what makes me puto ('pissed') with it because the evidence against their position it seems to be everywhere but they never want to look at it. And to say that since all phenomena are impermanent, so language and semantics are just conventionally true but not ultimately true just raises the question of how it is even possible in principle for something that is impermanent and shouldn't last for more than a moment gives the impression of permanence in the first place? To put it simply how could impermanent and momentary things could even in principle brought up the illusion of permanence if they are impermanent? Because if they want to salvage their position they would necessarily argue that the idea of permanence in the conscience, memory, and objects from everyday life are just illusions.

1639,"(From 2 of Lewis's other books.)         (Miracles, Chapter 11 ""God and 'Religion'"") (By 'Religion' Lewis means Pantheism).      (Quote)   ""The error which I am here trying to correct is one of the most sincere and respectable errors in the world; I have sympathy enough with it to feel shocked at the language I have been driven to use in stating the opposite view, which I believe to be the true one. To say that God ‘is a particular Thing’ does seem to obliterate the immeasurable difference not only between what He is and what all other things are but between the very mode of His existence and theirs. I must at once restore the balance by insisting that derivative things, from atoms to archangels, hardly attain to existence at all in comparison with their Creator. Their principle of existence is not in themselves. You can distinguish what they are from the fact that they are. The definition of them can be understood and a clear idea of them formed without even knowing whether they are. Existence is an ‘opaque’ addition to the idea of them. But with God it is not so: if we fully understood what God is we should see that there is no question whether He is. It would always have been impossible that He should not exist. He is the opaque centre of all existences, the thing that simply and entirely is, the fountain of facthood"".   (End quote)         The last quote is from Lewis's commentary on the nature psalms in the O.T.   All of the Scripture references in the beginning of the quote are from the Psalms.      (Reflections on the Psalms, Chapter 8 ""Nature"")   (Quote)   ""But of course the (Jewish) doctrine of Creation leaves Nature full of manifestations which show the presence of God, and created energies which serve Him. The light is His garment, the thing we partially see Him through (104:2), the thunder can be His voice (29:3–5). He dwells in the dark thundercloud (18:11), the eruption of a volcano comes in answer to His touch (104:32). The world is full of his emissaries and executors. He makes winds His messengers and flames His servants (104:4), rides upon cherubim (18:10), commands the army of angels.   All this is of course in one way very close to Paganism. Thor and Zeus also spoke in the thunder; Hermes or Iris was the messenger of the gods. But the difference, though subtle, is momentous, between hearing in the thunder the voice of God or the voice of a god. As we have seen, even in the creation- myths, gods have beginnings. Most of them have fathers and mothers; often we know their birthplaces. There is no question of self-existence or the timeless. Being is imposed upon them, as upon us, by preceding causes. They are, like us, creatures or products; though they are luckier than we in being stronger, more beautiful, and exempt from death. They are, like us, actors in the cosmic drama, not its authors. Plato fully understood this. His God creates the gods and preserves them from death by His own power; they have no inherent immortality. In other words, the difference between believing in God and in many gods is not one of arithmetic. As someone has said ‘gods’ is not really the plural of God; God has no plural. Thus, when you hear in the thunder the voice of a god, you are stopping short, for the voice of a god is not really a voice from beyond the world, from the uncreated. By taking the god’s voice away—or envisaging the god as an angel, a servant of that Other—you go further. The thunder becomes not less divine but more. By emptying Nature of divinity—or, let us say, of divinities—you may fill her with Deity, for she is now the bearer of messages.""

For suppose—as monism would have it—that there aren’t different ways to exist or modes of being. In that case, God enjoys the same generic existence enjoyed by everything else. But—per DDS—God is _identical_ to everything he _has_ , and hence God is identical to his existence. But in that case, God is identical to generic existence—the existence that you and everything else shares (under monism). But your existence, as Nemes explicitly says, is a _constituent part_ of you. God would therefore be a _constituent part_ of you, which contradicts classical theism. So, the _De Ente_ argument (conjoined with DDS, which is plausibly an _entailment_ of the _De Ente_ argument’s conclusion) requires pluralism about being.

1009,"Walter,      Libertarian freedom entails that you can, at the same time, have non- determining reasons for doing X and non-determining reasons for not-doing-X. What is the intention, beyond the choosing of one over the other? It is when you intend (and hence have chosen) to do one instead of the other, and thus are ready intending the action. If the intention is not the choice, then it would be the motivation. And in both cases there is no difference between our case of LFW and God's:      Before I finally make my choice, I have motivations for X and ~X. In w1 I go on to choose X; in w2 I go on to choose ~X. And yet there is no difference in my intrinsic properties between w1 and w2.      This is what is weird in LFW, but as explained, it is the same for God as well as for us. So this is no objection against divine simplicity per se.      But perhaps you think that the ""intention"" is neither the choosing nor the motivation, but an accompanying mental state that is always present when, and only when, a choice is made. In that case, the intention would NOT be a necessary condition for a choice being made. Because if it were, we would never be able to choose anything, since we would have to choose our intention before being able to make a choice, and that is circular or regressive. I can, under motivations for both X and ~X, and with no intention whatsoever (since I haven't made the choice yet), choose to do X or ~X and thus effectively, freely bring about X or ~X without this ""intention"" entity/property. So God's having or not having an intention in this case would be irrelevant for his power to choose, but it ALSO is the same for us.      But if the the problem is that God must be different when he chooses X as opposed to ~X, then again this would not work under libertarian freedom for us as either. Because (again) when you choose between X (in w1) or ~X (in w2), the cause of your choice has exactly the same intrinsic properties between worlds. The cause of your choosing X in w1 is you at t in state S; and the cause of your choosing ~X in w2 is you at t in state S. There is a branching, and yet there is no difference in intrinsic properties of you at t between worlds. So, once again: it is the same for us and God, and libertarian freedom does not require subjects to change in intrinsic properties between worlds in order to make choices.",walter libertarian freedom entail time non- determining reason x non-determining reason not-doing-x intention beyond choosing one intend hence chosen one instead thus ready intending action intention choice would motivation case difference case lfw finally make choice motivation x x w go choose x w go choose x yet difference intrinsic property w w weird lfw explained god well u objection divine simplicity per se perhaps think intention neither choosing motivation accompanying mental state always present choice made case intention would necessary condition choice made would never able choose anything since would choose intention able make choice circular regressive motivation x x intention whatsoever since made choice yet choose x x thus effectively freely bring x x without intention entityproperty intention case would irrelevant power choose also u problem god must different chooses x opposed x would work libertarian freedom u either choose x w x w cause choice exactly intrinsic property world cause choosing x w state cause choosing x w state branching yet difference intrinsic property world u god libertarian freedom require subject change intrinsic property world order make choice,theist,2377,1

2196,"@Infinite Growth (continued)      The area that we have to be most careful in is in judging particular intentions associated with a particular act. It is here that judgements are most unsure. Now, we also have to be careful not to completely de-link intentions from the exterior act. (This is a problem that occurred in 20th century Catholic theology. On this point, see Matthew Levering's recent book The Abuse of Conscience). The act is intended by the person and if the act is bad then the intention is bad in some way. However, the person again may be acting from ignorance or confusion or trying to achieve some real good and yet be going about it in the wrong way. In this instance, you can again explain moral principles and why a particular act is not good and this should help to guide their intentions in the future as they realize, for example, that a good end does not justify a bad means. etc.      However some people are in fact habitually bad. That is, they have bad character. In this instance another work of mercy is called for: Rebuking the sinner.      Regarding your suggestion that our only enemy is the principalities, this also is based on a partial reading of St. Paul. St. Paul also identifies the flesh as our enemy in Galatians 5:19ff, ""Now the deeds of the flesh (Greek: sarx) are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, etc..."" He warns that those who practice these things will not inherit the kingdom of God. Flesh is used in multiple and analogous ways in the NT and can be used to simply refer to the body, but here it refers to sinful desires, intentions and acts. So the flesh, in this sense, is also an enemy of the Christian according to Paul.      If we take a broader focus on the New Testament, we also find that ""the world"" (Greek: kosmos) is also an enemy of the Christian and this is reflected in the writings of St. John. Kosmos is also used in multiple senses in the NT so this does not entail that each use refers to something bad. However, a worldly spirit that says ""Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die"" (i.e. ""this world is all there is""; hence worldliness) is contrary to authentic faith and is another enemy of the Christian.      It is for this reason that the council of Trent identified three enemies of the Catholic viator: Satan, the world, and the flesh. So, the suggestion that we have only one enemy is based on a partial consideration of the New Testament at the exclusion of other parts.",infinite growth continued area careful judging particular intention associated particular act judgement unsure also careful completely de-link intention exterior act problem occurred th century catholic theology point see matthew recent book abuse conscience act intended person act bad intention bad way however person may acting ignorance confusion trying achieve real good yet going wrong way instance explain moral principle particular act good help guide intention future realize example good end justify bad mean etc however people fact habitually bad bad character instance another work mercy called rebuking sinner regarding suggestion enemy principality also based partial reading st paul st paul also identifies flesh enemy galatian ff deed flesh greek sarx evident immorality impurity sensuality idolatry sorcery enmity strife jealousy etc warns practice thing inherit kingdom god flesh used multiple analogous way nt used simply refer body refers sinful desire intention act flesh sense also enemy christian according paul take broader focus new testament also find world greek kosmos also enemy christian reflected writing st john kosmos also used multiple sens nt entail use refers something bad however worldly spirit say eat drink merry tomorrow die ie world hence worldliness contrary authentic faith another enemy christian reason council trent identified three enemy catholic viator satan world flesh suggestion one enemy based partial consideration new testament exclusion part,theist,2520,1

1519,"WCB      @Michael Copas      Whatever will we do with your devastating criticisms that no one else has ever considered before?      I have carefully examined a lot of classical theologians on this point.Augustine, Boethius, Ansalm, William of Okham, Duns Scotus, Aquinas, Molina and others. And some of the enormous modern secondary literature.      Augustine assert that though God foresees all he does not cause all. Boethius claims that as a man sees something, that man does not cause what he sees. Thus God sees future events but likewise does not cause them. And on and on it goes. Everybody is indeed wrong      The particular argument I posted is not answered by the nearly 1600 years of theologians trying to explain the issue of God's foreknowledge and free will. Not until Luther's ""Bondage Of The Will"" did the issue of this become a problem.      Late in his life after the Pelagian affair Augustine gave up on free will, which was followed by Calvin, Luther et all.      I am sure that somewhere somebody else has made the argument I have, but I have yet to see anybody that has among the theologian community.      The key concep I wrote about is if Go d decides to create a Universe, God must choose an initial states of creation. And that we are told by centuries of theologians God foresees the future. Based on biblical claims God does that.   Now all I do is follow these claims to their logical conclusion. No classical theologians had the wit to notice this problem.

791,"@Walter      Do i not? One of the classical responses a theist make to the problem of evil is to say ""there are certain goods that could only be gained in a world like our own"". Even platonists argue that.      Well, the christian does have the example of the saints, whose suffering and hardships make their lifes noble and interesting* not only to us but even to themselves. To a christian, suffering is supposed to be seen not as a crappy thing, but as a way of uniting with Christ and climbing the latter to being similar to Him.      Not only on they but on normal people, perhaps even on your case, you can see people who look at terrible times they had and see their better situation as enobled or even justified by the bad times. This even on totally secular contexts, not considering the beatific vision(who would turn everything acceptable to the receiver).      This actually seems probably a very alien thinking to a modern unbeliever, except that Nietzsche did get there, so read eventually the start of the City of God, the part that Dr. Feser is quoting, slowly and trying to see things like St. Augustine. Perhaps it help. Likely not, for it is quite a jump.      And remember: this is not a way to us to see this world as justified, but a way to trying to see how God could see things that way. The same God that do a lot of things we humans cant do, like kill people and all that.      But anyway, trying to grow on this worldview i realized that the christians and a average person today, even several theists, see the relevant things with completely diferent eyes, so who knows how much this discussion can do.

The Vatican Council defines: ""This gift of truth and never-failing faith was therefore divinely conferred on Peter and his successors in this see..."".

For if x was caused to begin to exist, then x’s existing _is_ caused from without. The cause, though, is merely an _originating_ (rather than continuously _sustaining_ ) cause.

We can make progress towards infinity in the same way that 8 is closer to a completed infinity than 6 (I am not speaking of my infinite sequence here, just making a numerical metaphor).

In principle, it could easily be the case that A’s pure esse _just is_ A’s F-ness, while B’s pure _esse_ _just is_ B’s G-ness, where F-ness isn’t G-ness. This is kinda similar to how, for the classical theist, God’s pure esse _just is_ God’s omnipotence. It’s not as though God is pure esse _plus_ omnipotence; God’s pure esse _just is_ his omnipotence. The same can be said in the case of A and F—it’s not as though A is pure being _plus_ F-ness; A (and A’s pure esse) _just is_ A’s F-ness. And B is differentiated from A by dint of B (and B’s pure esse) being identical to G-ness, which is distinct from F-ness. Here, A and B are discernible: F-ness is a feature A has (and, indeed, is identical to) that B lacks, while G-ness here is a feature B has (and, indeed, is identical to) that A lacks, and such features differentiate them.[7] Furthermore, each of A and B is pure esse.

1201,"@Walter. I agree we’re going around in circles. I could use an analogy of a mother shouting at her daughter to get out of the busy road, and of the elder brother feeling empathy for his sister while accepting that the telling off was necessary. However you will take that in a univocal sense where you can’t translate this onto the big picture, or focus on the idea that I’m claiming that suffering is God ‘telling us off’, which is not the point at all.      I don’t claim to understand the whole picture, but there is a beauty in the universe that relies on this balance between the good stuff and the bad stuff, where our overcoming of difficulties are in a way more valuable because of the difficulties. Without decay physical reality would be a disgusting mess, without suffering our bodies could not have evolved. If you see the physical world as everything, and our physical existence as the peak of some very lucky random circumstances over time, as I did as an atheist, then the idea of this physical universe as a phase of an essentially spiritual creation process makes no sense at all. So instead you decide that a good God would instead just create something like angels in a paradise, and not bother with the often messy physical universe and human beings at all. Which seems to me to loose a great deal of richness from existence, for all it’s troubles. Some of the angels seem to have had this view, so at least you’re not alone!

For if there _could_ be more than one perfect being, then the properties to which Gel appeals _are not perfections after all_ ,[18] and hence to assert that they’re perfections _just is_ to assert, in part, that there couldn’t be more than one perfect being—and yet that’s the very question at issue. Admittedly, this worry gets into really tricky waters in Perfect Being Theology (PBT). For example: when are we entitled to claim that some property P is a perfection? Must we first know that P is even _possible_ to begin with? Or is the intuition that <P is a perfection> _itself_ a reason to think P is possible?

1835,"I agree that these two positions are distinct and should be kept apart for the purpose of recognizing whether either one is contrary to _what the Church teaches_. Von Balthasar's position is much less easy to attack as contrary, or as clearly and explicitly contrary.      But whether salvation for all it is something that we can ""reasonably"" hope for is not the same as whether it is clearly and explicitly contrary to what the Church teaches. Some teachings make it imprudent, unwise, or temerarious (rash) to propose, without being definitely opposed to Church teaching, because the Church teaching strongly **leans** in a certain direction without (yet) being _definitive_ about it. For example, the Holy Office stated over 100 years ago that it MAY NOT safely be taught that Christ in his human intellect did not have the knowledge of those in Beatitude during his period on Earth, nor even that the position be held as debatable or uncertain.      In addition to the (many) biblical passages that _at least point toward_ the result that some are damned, there are some passages whose import are (and have been taken traditionally as saying) that some are _in fact_ damned, rather than that some may be damned. And whether they have been ""traditionally"" taught so, versus ""Traditionally"" taught so, i.e. whether the weight of the apostolic and Fathers teachings' comes down definitively on one side of that, I hesitate to say, but then again perhaps _so should everyone else_. It may be **rash** to say (and teach) that all may be saved is a reasonable hope.      Nevertheless, one may certainly PRAY for all, in the sense of (a) having good will toward all; and (b) asking God to offer his favor to all; so that (c) all who _might be saved_ will indeed be saved. While your benevolence applies to all in that **any one** might be saved, and thus of any one you hope he be saved, it need not encompass an active hope that _every_ single one be saved.

3112,"Fundamentally, then, my challenge for the Trinitarian proponent of the Neo- Platonic proof is as follows.

But if the explanation is internal to G, then something _within_ a unified plurality can explain the unity of said plurality—in which case, the same could apply to the objects within NPCP’s domain of quantification, thereby undermining NPCP’s demand for an outside explanation of such objects. If the explanation is external to G, then there is something outside of or external to God which explains something about God, which is obviously incompatible with classical theism. If the explanation is G itself, then an object within which there is a unified plurality can explain the unity of said plurality without recourse to any external thing—in which case, the same could apply to the objects within NPCP’s domain of quantification, thereby undermining NPCP’s demand for an outside explanation of such objects.

Here in Brazil none of my friends really like to talk about that and don't care that much and I can say the same thing about our philosophers - they're a bunch of commies and half-baked intellectuals when it comes to anything that detours from politics that they ''know a lot''. In short, I don't have anyone to talk about that kind of thing.

If cells we're conjoined to survive in the first place why do a lot of them have to die every day for the sake of others if the 'plan' was just for the single cell to survive in the first place? Why do we have apoptosis and the like? Or worse, like I said some comments ago replying to Tom, why do the 'true individuals' (the cells) come to form up 'the illusion' of a single individual? It means that the dog we see every day that 'seems' to rely on and works in unity with his own parts as a single thing to chase down the bikers across the street is just an aggregate of individual cells. That's not just disturbing I think that it's evil to think something like that.      As you guys can see I'm not a pro in biology. That's why I rely so much on the ''armchair'' philosophy. I can see that it is problematic to say that cells are individuals but I don't have a 'biological argument' (whatever that means) to affirm that. But the point is what is the motivation behind that 'science guys' to affirm something bizarre as that?

For example, I remember for certain what I did yesterday, but still my memory is not infallible; I am quite clear that two and two makes four, but I often make mistakes in long addition sums.

It is a strange objection, then, which is sometimes urged against Catholics, that they cannot prove and assent to the Church's infallibility, unless they first believe in their own. Certitude, as I have said, is directed to one or other definite concrete proposition. I am certain of proposition one, two, three, four, or five, one by one, each by itself. I may be certain of one of them, without being certain of the rest; that I am certain of the first makes it neither likely nor unlikely that I am certain of the second; but were I infallible, then I should be certain, not only of one of them, but of all, and of many more besides, which have never come before me as yet.

807,"There are many horrendous evils that a loving father God should prevent/stop, and should be able to. For example, many cases of horrendous suffering caused by some diseases; sexual abuse and torture; etc. The list could go on and on. And Christians do believe that God does, in fact, sometimes prevent or stop said evils through (for example) miracles or providence. So it is a problem why there are still so many of these evils going on and our loving Father does nothing about it - not even when people desperately or earnestly pray and beg him for help.      ""And how could God prevent the evils in the world without also preventing the wonderful goods that accidentally give rise to them or to which by Divine mercy they lead?""

But this is a serious epistemic cost - because when I look at the world, it does seem like there are purely gratuitous horrendous evils, or that God should be doing better, and so on.

2136,"@ Laudator Temporis Acti,      ""He doesn't ""want"" 127 to be a prime and 128 to be a power of 2. They are those things per se.""      They are these things for either one of two reasons.      First, they are so because of a system of axioms with rules of inference that allows us to prove it as a conclusion of a formal argument. This method of proof is not necessarily connected with the world we measure and physically inhabit. For example, without the infinite parallel postulate the axioms can have added to them an intrinsic curvature in which by locally parallel transport a circle can be constructed whose area is a rational multiple of its radius and this circle can definitely be squared.      So much for ""per se"" or human fiat. I don't even have to invoke the God beyond human understanding to get that.      The second method is by measuring the physical world we inhabit and building up a finite mathematics which cannot be fudged up by arbitrarily adding axioms which have not been physically proven themselves.      Well it is just God's choice (will) that the local physics supports your system. We can examine what God *can* do by examining what a model of God allows, but we cannot examine what God *cannot* do this way because God is greater than a model of God (a picture of you can show your hair color but it can't jump or walk - but you can jump or walk and jump because you are not limited by what the picture cannot do) . If you conclude from a model that God cannot do something, you have only proved that it can't be done in the model - which is not God.      A good physical model of God is a computer with a program. A computer program exists in which any circle, measured in the program, is exactly 6 times its radius. This can be illustrated as a virtual reality in which virtual actors measure virtual circles and always get that result. It can be shown as a visual animation that can be watched, as in a computer game. This is a model of God. If it can be made logical (in the measuring sense, the second method of proof, in which axioms are experimentally determined as described above) on a computer, then God can make it logical in physical reality, which, of course, would be a different physical reality then the one we have come to know and love.      Similarly, God is not limited to creating a physical universe where 127 is prime and 128 is a power of 2. It just outrages your sense of mathematical truth as it is known to you from living in this universe, but emotion doesn't belong in mathematical proofs (in this universe).      It is just an old ""rule"" without ground that mathematics and logic are independent of God. It is just an assumption.      ""So who is right?""      That you cannot, in your mind, know who is right does not mean that there is no truth or that no one can enunciate it on a particular matter. That 15 people give different accounts of some event does not mean that none of the accounts are correct. If you drive from Topeka to Billings and two witnesses disagree on what you had for lunch, that does not mean that neither of them were correct. You had a tuna and marshmallow sandwich.

990,"The ""God Hypothesis"" is just another Ultimate Why question, which Paul Edwards addressed many years ago in a Intro to Phil textbook      ""Regarding our second issue, cosmic why questions, Edwards begins by considering what he calls “the theological why.” The theological answer to the theological why posits that a god answers the question of meaning. Major difficulties here include how we could say anything intelligible about such disembodied minds, as well as all of the other difficulties involved with justifying such beliefs. Edwards focuses particularly on whether the theological answer really answers the question, mentioning a number of philosophers in this regard: “Schopenhauer referred to all such attempts to reach a final resting place in the series of causes as treating the causal principle like a ‘hired cab’ which one dismisses when one has reached one’s destination. Bertrand Russell objects that such writers work with an obscure and objectionable notion of explanation: to explain something, we are not at all required to introduce a “self-sufficient” entity, whatever that may be…Nagel insists that it is perfectly legitimate to inquire into the reasons for the existence of the alleged absolute Being…”[ii] Thus, the theological answer appears to be one of convenience that does not fully answer our query; rather, it stops the inquiry by asking no more why questions.      Edwards differentiates the theological why question—are there gods and do they provide the ultimate explanation?—from what he calls the “super-ultimate why.” A person posing this latter question regards the theological answer as not going far enough because it does not answer questions such as “Why are there gods at all?” or “Why is there anything at all?” or “Why does everything that is, exist?” The theological answer simply puts an end to why questions arbitrarily; it stops short of pushing the question to its ultimate end. One might respond that it is obsessive to continually ask why questions, but most reflective persons do ask “Why does anything or everything exist?” suggesting that the question is basic to thoughtful persons. Of course, it may be that we just don’t know the answer to this ultimate mystery—all we can say is that the existence of anything is a mystery, its ultimate explanation remaining always beyond us.      According to Edwards, while some philosophers take the ultimate why question seriously many others argue that it is meaningless. The reason for this is that if a question cannot in principle be answered, as so many philosophers claim about this super ultimate why question, then that question is meaningless. Critics of this view agree that the question is radically different from all others but disagree that it is meaningless. They respond that ordinarily, questions must in principle be capable of being answered to be meaningful, but not in the case of this ultimate question. Yet if a question really cannot be answered, and if all possible answers have been ruled out a priori, is that not the very definition of a meaningless question?      Another way of arriving at the conclusion that the question “why does everything exist?” is meaningless, is to consider how when we ordinarily ask “why x?” we assume the answer is something other than x. But in the case of “why anything at all?” it is not possible to find something outside of everything to explain everything. So meaningful why questions are those which are about anything in the set of all things, but if our why question is about something other than everything, then why has lost its meaning because it is logically impossible to have an answer.""

Because Kant offered a _positive_ alternative to the traditional metaphysics that upheld theism, whereas Hume’s critique is essentially negative. To be sure, contemporary commentators are correct to hold that it is too simple to read Hume as a mere skeptic, full stop. True, he does try to undermine traditional metaphysical views about substance, causation, the self, moral value, etc. But he also emphasizes that the hold such notions have over common sense cannot be shaken by philosophical skepticism, since they are too deeply rooted in human psychology. And for purposes of “common life,” they are indispensable.

Could there be a timeless _event_ (i.e., happening or occurrence)? Setting this aside, there is a deeper worry. For the event in question is _distinct_ from God.[5] But under classical theism, anything distinct from God is created and sustained by God (Rogers (1996, p. 167), Bergmann and Brower (2006, p. 361), Grant (2019, ch. 1), and Kerr (2019, pp. 15 and 44)). But surely whatever x that God creates and sustains is such that God is free to withdraw his sustaining activity of x. So, God could withdraw his sustaining power from the relevant event. But then there would be the event of God’s withdrawing this sustaining power from the event of God’s withdrawing his sustaining power of O.

In fact, part of the point of Chapman’s book itself was precisely to uphold that authority, and in particular to defend the Council’s teaching on papal infallibility. And yet for all that, Chapman does not shrink from the judgment that the historical facts show that “no Catholic has the right to deny that Honorius was a heretic” (p. 116). The reason he could say this is that the error Honorius was guilty of did not occur in the context of an _ex cathedra_ definition.

For practical purposes, “matter” came to be treated as just whatever accepted physical theories happen to say about it.

Good, being omniscient, would know what all these possible creations are, and also know which ones are better, which less good, and which one is best of all.      Being infinitely good, would it not go against His nature to choose a lesser good, as against a better one? Similarly, would it not go against His nature to to choose not to create, if He knows that the choice to create is better?      Does this all come down more to definitions than substance?

1362,"Splendid! Finally an actual argument.      Let’s recap: your initial claim is that the logical problem of evil provides good philosophical reasons not to believe in the God of classical theism because it shows there is no way to reconcile the bad things that happen to people with “Omni” attributes we want to affirm about God.      A response to this claim was then given that one possible “out” that can preserve these divine attributes by hypothesizing that God could make restitution to the wronged parties in the next life.      You then made a bunch of irrelevant remarks about how everyone who disagrees with you on this topic is stupid, and most people probably gave up on the conversation. But now we actually have a non-trivial and non-circular response! An immortal soul cannot exist that survives after death because we don’t know how a soul interacts with the brain, so it is therefore impossible for God to offer restitution to a person after death.      Now that we have that all our of the way, ready for the philosophy? You sure? Ok here it is:      I reject your premise. An unsolved question is not a demonstration that two concepts are incompatible.      This is further justified by the arguments that Dr. Feser has made here (and others have made elsewhere) that the mind cannot be wholly materially determinate, and that there must be an immaterial component to our thoughts (which is positive evidence for the soul).

1096,"@ Infinite_Growth,      ""speaking of free will, it disturbs me greatly that traditional Catholic theology has not considered animal abuse to be a deadly sin like Lust or Gluttony. That goes very contrary to religions like Judaism or Buddhism.""      First, note of pre-Christian Judaism that it certainly permitted the use of animals   for human needs, including for rites of sacrifice. Christianity does not include the use of animals for sacrifice so from your point of view that is an improvement.      Second, note that Jesus said:      ""Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."" (Matthew 5:17-20 KJV)      But much of what is specifically listed as law in pre-Christian Judaism is subsumed in Christianity as Love rather than being specifically listed, so while abuse of animals is not listed, it is an act of hatred against what God loves, which includes all of Creation. Now we have been given all of material Creation for our proper and needful use, but an act of hatred against anything is a turning from God and is a mortal or deadly sin as Christians always understood.      So at no time did Christianity embrace the evil treatment of animals. It would have always been recognized as hate. But as in many other things, a formal doctrine against the mistreatment of animals was later worked out from these foundational principles of Christianity. It certainly is explicit now. See, for example, the Catechism as promulgated by Pope John Paul II.      Buddhism is not a development of Christianity or Judaism.

1278,"Dr. Feser, thank you for a solid post on suffering.      A few of the comments above have brought up the problem of ""animal pain."" While I understand the standard response to that to be something along the lines of ""necessity justified in view of the perfection of creation,"" I'm wondering if there is not a richer answer hidden in the back of our tradition. Specificly, I'm wondering about the role of angels in all this.      Think of something like Tolkien's cosmology - physical evil and disorder entered into creation when the principalities and powers of the world (The Valar and Maiar) entered into conflict with each other, one desiring to fullfill the creators plan to make a habitation for the ""children of illuvitar"" (rational life), and others, out to make a dominion for themselves. As proper ""sub-creators,"" God, in his secondary causality, had given spiritual beings the duties of care and creation in the physical world, and the flaws, imperfections, and downright violence of creation were due to the infidelity of some of the powers intrusted to their care. If we hold the standard line that fallen angels fell in the first instant of their creation, and, further, that they had been, nevertheless, been given dominion over certain parts or aspects of creation, then Johanine language about the ""lord of this world,"" and Pauline language about the ""princes of the powers of the air,"" makes a lot more sense, and can even be joined to an evolutionary cosmology.      The universe is an odd place, and the creation of the conditions for life, let alone rational life, in an odd, (physically fallen?) cosmos could be seen as the fruit of angelic conquest over malign forces. Furthermore, evolution itself might be seen as being helped along or guided by forces trying to bring about God's will in creation.

Even better, when the new development is expressed in a way that _manifestly_ connects to and coordinates with the pieces of the prior teachings that it IS meant to alter in some qualified way. It is true development when a Catholic who accepted the old way of saying the teaching can look at the new way and say of it: ""I see that this re-frames the old concepts in a way that introduces a new distinction never made before, and is not so much a _denial_ of the old teaching but a refinement of it.""

Or perhaps N timelessly, intentionally, and freely wills the creation of the universe (including all the changes therein). In this case, N explains why there are any changes (at all, ever). Moreover, the explanation here doesn’t presuppose the prior reality of change, since something’s _causing_ change does not require _that thing itself_ to first (intrinsically) change (lest the classical theist admit that God changes in God’s creative act).

1609,"I would add: if one is growing, and the other is not, **that very growth** should imply you exercise patience and understanding toward the one lagging behind. If you have been given a gift more than another person, do not cast off the other as unworthy: it was a GIFT to you, not your own merit that brought it. Why, therefore, would you despise the person who has not received the gift, in which state _you would still be if you had not been granted the gift?_      And further: by patiently asking God that He also shower your spouse with comparable gifts of growth, mayhap you will merit God granting such growth. So: your observing a lack in your spouse is _reason to do something to help your spouse (by prayer and sacrifice),_ not reason to leave.      And further: do not let pride deceive you: if you see that you have grown in _one_ way (where your spouse has not), never forget that perhaps your spouse has grown in 3 or 4 ways less visible, where you have not. There are a thousand different avenues of growth, not one or two. God works at a different pace in each area, for each person. And not all growth is manifest to either the person growing or to those around.      Never imagine that ""incompatibility"" due to one person growing and the other not constitutes a basis for believing the marriage is ""void"".

1441," _In the American context, how about totally free education (books, tuition, room and board, everything) at every level for historically oppressed minorities, paid for by the super-rich, and continued until such time as the wealth gap between whites and minorities was erased._      Amazing how so many plans to erase a racial divide (which must always be illicit and evil, not at all natural) inevitably turns into a not-so-subtle payday for people.

And it's not going to be the super-rich paying either.      If the concern is to provide education as cheaply and freely as possible, maybe we should consider price caps on tuition.

1506,"You want full message, fine here.   -I read your ""The experience of God"" book twice and I have some questions regarding it.   First is a minor nitpick (And I mean no offence for saying this) but I feel you have a tendency to use too many $10 words. Case in point; you use the word ""quotidian"" at least 5 times that I can remember, when that word is almost never better than its friendly companions ""daily"", ""everyday"", ""ordinary"", and ""commonplace"". Now having a large vocabulary isn't a bad thing, but a flagrant use of obscure words made it very difficult to understand your point.   My second problem is your concept of God and how you define it. Your definition of God is that in trying to elevate Him to the loftiest heights, heights truly befitting the magnificence of God, I feel you have reduced Him to empty concepts/platitudes, both completely meaningless and as uninspiring as mathematical axioms. What could it mean to say God is existence, or consciousness, or bliss, or any of the other abstract concepts that one often hears thrown about by other religious believers: love, truth, the alpha and the omega, and so on? One might as well argue that God is electricity, gravity, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Of course, this would be ludicrous. Who would seek ecstatic union with the weak nuclear force, or pray to electricity, or find solace in the presence of gravity? But slap a poetic, inspirational-sounding abstraction on God (being, truth, beauty, etc.), and suddenly the whole thing gains a veneer of credibility it hasn't earned.   The meaninglessness of your idea of God culminates in your assertion that God must be simple, unable to “possess distinct parts, or even distinct properties” (p.128), and, as eternal, He can’t be subject to change either (time being a measure of change – not to mention the fact that change indicates a movement from potentiality to actuality, whereas God is pure actuality (another meaningless concept)). What can possibly be left over after one has removed distinct parts/properties and the ability to change?   Lastly you defend all of this by claiming that any other way of thinking about God is guilty of anthropomorphism; the tendency to re-make God in our own image and likeness. The charge of anthropomorphism is undeniably valid when people try to convince us that a being even the tiniest bit like what you describe, God cares about what you do in the privacy of your own bedroom, or desires human worship, or takes sides favouring one equally petty, narrow- minded tribe over another, but it is far from obvious that the claim that God isn’t subject to change or lacks distinguishing properties fares any better. The problem here is to explain how this God can be as transcendent as you claim and yet not dissolve into meaningless abstractions. Unfortunately, to the extent that you attempt this impossible task, all you do is appeal to even more meaninglessness propositions. If God can’t change, He must therefore be unfeeling and unable to be aware of contingent truths, you argue?   Hart: It’s just that “his knowledge or bliss or love does not involve any metaphysical change in him” (p.137). God therefore can’t act in the world, nor can He be free, you say?   Hart: God’s “creative intention… can be understood as an eternal act that involves no temporal change within him.

As Leftow argues, the GSA-property is either a perfection or a constituent of other perfections. Why think this? First, consider that ‘[b]eing a potential ultimate source of some proportion of what benefits things is a good property to have’ (Leftow (2012), 22). But being the ultimate source of _all_ that benefits things would be the maximal degree of this good property, and hence, given that ‘a property is a perfection iff it is the maximal degree of a degreed good attribute to have’ (Leftow (2012), 22), being the ultimate source of all that benefits things is a perfection.

Second, we can think about providing an account of inertial persistence that can compete against alternatives to existential inertia. Classical theists provide an alternative to existential inertia, i.e., that a timeless God sustains temporal objects in existence, and that they would object that Humean Supervenience fails to provide an ultimate explanation of the persistence of objects.

O ceases to exist just in case the potential for the first predicate’s extension to be empty becomes actual (else: the potential for the second predicate’s extension to be everything becomes actual). Since—per CP—every potential that is actualized requires something already actual to cause this actualization, and since the only plausible way to cause the relevant change to the predicate(s) is to cause O to cease to exist (i.e., to positively destroy O), we can infer the truth of EIT just as before.",third seems plausible infer eit employing notion ‘ cambridge use refers change predicate satisfied without corresponding gain loss property whether intrinsic extrinsic property particular focus predicate ‘ ‘ consider change extension predicate cease exist case potential first extension empty becomes actual else potential second extension everything becomes actual since—per cp—every potential actualized requires something already actual cause actualization since plausible way cause relevant change predicate cause cease exist ie positively destroy infer truth eit,sceptic,942,0

First, this requires that there _actually are_ such things as events—a controversial assumption which significantly weakens the Aristotelian proof. Yes, there are objects, and such objects have, gain, and lose various properties. But are there such things as _events_ corresponding to such havings, gains, and losses, _over and above_ the objects and properties? It’s not obvious. (Also, even if we countenance _some_ events within our ontology, do we seriously want to countenance _withdrawals_ therein, too? Might as well believe in shadows, cold fronts, laps, and other occult entities belched from the land of voodoo metaphysics.) Second, the assumption seems to be rather _un-Aristotelian_. At least according to standard Aristotelian stories, it is _substances_ , not events, that are the causal relata.

3327,"One might think that the number two has a passive potency for existence that requires being actualized by something else—perhaps a necessary intellect, or perhaps by the number one together with the successor function.

This, of course, doesn’t rule out a necessary intellect that actualizes such an object; but the onus is not on _me_ , in the present context, to positively show that this is _false_ ; the onus is on the one _positively claiming_ that composition entails passive potency to show that _any composite_ —including such an abstract object at the bottom level of the abstract grounding hierarchy—has passive potency. “But doesn’t Feser do precisely that in his Augustinian proof?”, you ask. “Well,” I respond, “for starters, he only argues that abstracta exist as divine ideas. This doesn’t entail that abstracta have passive potencies that are _actualized_ by the necessary intellect.

1855,"Regarding your suggestion that it is up to me why I should hold a position that is contrary to the state of our society and that this is ""up to me"": Well this is true, but profoundly unhelpful for our discussion. It is ""up to you"" whether you believe in fairies and goblins. You are ""free"" to believe in fairies and goblins, but that does not make such a belief rooted in Scripture or Tradition. Nor does it make it reasonable. And choices that are rooted neither in reason nor revelation are baseless. Such ""freedom"" is really no freedom at all. It is a sheer willfulness to believe whatever I want to believe regardless of reason, evidence, and revelation. That is the point. Authentic freedom is always rooted in reason and/or revelation. In other words, authentic freedom is always rooted in the truth. If I have neither reason nor revelation to support my belief in fairies, then it is unreasonable to do so. If you wish to believe in fairies because they give you warm fuzzy feelings, you are ""free"" to do so, but that does not make your choice a good choice. It makes it baseless just as your choice to believe that everyone may be going to heaven is baseless.      This leads to the biggest problem with the position: counterfactuals. As Edward Feser has noted, it is part of the Tradition that rational beings are in hell, namely Satan and His Angels. It is also clear from Scripture that the way is narrow and few will find it. Now some passages of Scripture are difficult to interpret and admit varying interpretations. However, if one's ""interpretation"" involves denying or ignoring the testimony of Scripture, then this is not really an interpreation so much as a denial of the explicit teaching of Sripture. So if Scripture teaches that the way to eternal life is narrow and few will find it and I say it is broad and everyone will (or might find), then I am denying revelation. Who will or will not be saved is not something you or I could know apart from revelation. However, it is something that God knows and He has revealed to us that ""few will find it"".

3295,"Second, even if (as Aquinas’s argument from change _at best_ shows[29]) the first cause is first in each _per se_ chain of change, it doesn’t follow that it is first in every _per accidens_ chain of change. And so nothing in the reasoning above rules out the first cause being first in every _per se_ chain but nevertheless being actualized (and so non-first) in some _per accidens_ chain. (This is perfectly compatible with the claim that _per accidens_ chains presuppose more fundamental _per se_ chains upon which the former depend. E.g. the first cause could actualize all the changes that creatures undergo which are located in _per se_ chains, _including_ the creaturely change that causally impacts the first cause in a _per accidens_ manner (such that the first cause, upon receiving the relevant actuality, does not possess it wholly derivatively). For instance, the first cause could actualize all the _per se_ changes involved in a creature saying a petitionary prayer to the first cause, and this petitionary prayer could then causally impact the first cause in a _per accidens_ manner—say, by causally influencing the first cause to fulfill the petition. Here, all _per se_ chains terminate in the first cause, and moreover all _per accidens_ chains depend on more fundamental _per se_ chains, _and yet_ the first cause is still non-first in some _per accidens_ chain.)",second even argument change best show first cause first per se chain change follow first every per accidens chain change nothing reasoning rule first cause first every per se chain nevertheless actualized non-first per accidens chain perfectly compatible claim per accidens chain presuppose fundamental per se chain upon former depend eg first cause could actualize change creature undergo located per se chain including creaturely change causally impact first cause per accidens manner first cause upon receiving relevant actuality posse wholly derivatively instance first cause could actualize per se change involved creature saying petitionary prayer first cause petitionary prayer could causally impact first cause per accidens manner—say causally influencing first cause fulfill petition per se chain terminate first cause moreover per accidens chain depend fundamental per se chain yet first cause still non-first per accidens chain,sceptic,1382,0

From the beginning, contrary to what Ed claims, suffering was a problem and hence, from the beginning, there was a a need for theodicies.   God may be good in only an analogous way, but an analogy has something in common with what it is compared to, and your definition of goodness is contrary to what is generally understood by goodness. What is more important is that I think you are a good person and that in everyday life you use the same definition of goodness that I do.   And on that definition of goodness, every possibilty of evil would be ruled out if that were possible. But yiurb definition of god's goodness is simply circular ""Good is what God does and whatever god does is good"".      It is indeed so that the Christian good is not all good in any meaningful sense, not just not in the sense that we are but in no sense at all.   Using people and their suffering as a means to get a more attractive creation is not good in any meaningful sense. It is, in every meaingful sense, appalling.

2178,"(final segment--see previous 3 posts from me)      So, taking all of these points together, we are left to wonder if anyone can be declared FORMALLY heretical posthumously (at least in a case where there is no evidence they were judged heretical and obstinately persisted in their views). This then raises the question as to whether one can, and/or should, be anathematized posthumously at all. This has obviously occurred, presumably also in cases other than that of Honorius, so it certainly can happen. BUT, what we do not have in Honorius's case is a judgment that he was FORMALLY heretical (a distinction I suspect was not fully formulated or conceived at the time of Council condemning him). And once this distinction between formal and material heresy is made, we must face more squarely whether it is appropriate, or even possible, to condemn someone who is not formally heretical (as it seems Honorius could not have been). Prior to this distinction being made, we can likely forgive such anathemas, but it seems this distinction now affects how such judgments can be made (and perhaps even how we assess anathemas given before the material/formal distinction was fully developed).      In any case, we see that it was only a future pope and council who passed these judgments about a previous pope. At the very least, this should give great pause to anyone not in such authority to presume too definitely that anything a current or previous pope did was heretical. But this is especially true if one goes down the path of implying formal heresy, as for a current pope that would ultimately require the judgment of the Pope himself, and would be questionable if even a current Pope could do that in respect to a previous Pope (see above). I realize Feser is not arguing otherwise, but I suspect some who read this might apply what he says to current situations and neglect to appreciate the limits the points I raise place on such assessments. (And, we might add, such people could never have it seems even more than an opinion, though perhaps a well informed one, that a current pope held even a materially heretical view, since the judgment of heresy would ultimately fall to the Pope himself).      All this said, to reiterate a previous key point, in respect to Honorius, we can ask whether the current distinction between formal and material heresy would preclude anathemas like those against Honorius from taking place today. And, we may even ask whether the authority of a current pope would permit qualifying, or perhaps even removing, the judgment against Honorius in later councils, depending upon the extent to which one determines juridical declarations of councils (bearing in mind juridical decisions do not seem to be infallible, even if in their time they are authoritative), are or are not components of magisterial tradition which oblige agreement with current judgments, papal or otherwise.

1316,"I agree with Walter that the ""God is good only in an analogical sense, not a univocal one!"" is a horrible and useless defense. As he said, when there is an analogy there is something in common; in particular, in ""God is good"" there is an analogy of proper proportionality. It is not a metaphor. For the classical theist, God is the source of all actualities - and that includes virtues and moral agency -, and as the source of all perfection and pure act God must FORMALLY possess all pure perfections (that is, perfections that in themselves include no limitation), but in an eminent way. The formal possession of pure perfections by God is insisted upon by many thomists (e.g. Garrigou-Lagrange) and is compatible with analogy (again, it's an analogy of proper proportionality).      Therefore, one can only say that ""God is not a moral agent"" or ""God is not virtuous"" if one believes that moral agency and virtue are not pure perfections. But I think it's obvious that they are pure perfections; the fact that moral agency is found in us in a limited, creaturely manner doesn't make it any less of a perfection just like the fact that wisdom is found in us in a changing, limited, creaturely manner doesn't mean wisdom is not a perfection - and the theist certainly says God is wise in a literal way. God is therefore also properly said to be morally good - indeed, morally perfect - and this goodness cannot contradict what seems basic to us with regard to evil, moral value, etc. Just like we wouldn't say God is omniscient if he didn't literally know (e.g.) that we exist. This is also why I think the ""Brian Davies"" line of approaching the PoE is entirely useless. And it has nothing to do with classical theism per se, but rather with moral virtue being or not being a pure perfection. Needless to say, most people would agree that if God does not at all care to stop a child from being tortured, then God is seriously deficient (which should be impossible).      Walter,      That being said, I wonder how you can feel so confident about the presence of suffering on this earth being totally pointless, and that it would be better to have a world (e.g.) without any Fall at any point. Don't you think that lies beyond your cognitive capacities? At the very least, doesn't it give you pause? It is very clear to me that, for instance, a world consisting of nothing but innocent people being tortured without end is a horrible world and God could not make it. But while that is clear, it is not at all clear to me that it would be immoral to have a world in which people suffered for some finite time on earth, and then went on to enjoy a much longer happy afterlife. And it is far from clear to me that the finite sufferings experienced in that world could not end up contributing to making the good end-state better, or just allowing for a good amount of soul-building, etc. I think you should give more credit to skeptical theism.      Don't get me wrong, I do see the strength in the problem of evil. But it seems to me that you are a bit too confident in the idea that there could be no morally sufficient reasons for God to create a world like ours; especially given that we might only know such a small part of life and the world (it could be like judging a whole novel on the basis of the first pages).",agree walter god good analogical sense univocal one horrible useless defense said analogy something common particular god good analogy proper proportionality metaphor classical theist god source actuality - includes virtue moral agency - source perfection pure act god must formally posse pure perfection perfection include limitation eminent way formal possession pure perfection god insisted upon many thomists eg garrigou-lagrange compatible analogy analogy proper proportionality therefore one say god moral agent god virtuous one belief moral agency virtue pure perfection think obvious pure perfection fact moral agency found u limited creaturely manner make le perfection like fact wisdom found u changing limited creaturely manner mean wisdom perfection - theist certainly say god wise literal way god therefore also properly said morally good - indeed morally perfect - goodness contradict seems basic u regard evil moral value etc like say god omniscient literally know eg exist also think brian davy line approaching poe entirely useless nothing classical theism per se rather moral virtue pure perfection needle say people would agree god care stop child tortured god seriously deficient impossible walter said wonder feel confident presence suffering earth totally pointless would better world eg without fall point think lie beyond cognitive capacity least give pause clear instance world consisting nothing innocent people tortured without end horrible world god could make clear clear would immoral world people suffered finite time earth went enjoy much longer happy afterlife far clear finite suffering experienced world could end contributing making good end-state better allowing good amount soul-building etc think give credit skeptical theism get wrong see strength problem evil seems bit confident idea could morally sufficient reason god create world like especially given might know small part life world could like judging whole novel basis first page,theist,3317,1

What, for instance, does the timeless-to-temporal explanatory relation consist in? How can something timeless cause (or ground, or realize, or whatever) temporal things? If a dynamic view of time is correct, wouldn’t the timeless cause change at least in its relational properties, thereby entailing _succession_ in its life (and, hence, temporality)?[19] Moreover, why does the timeless cause seem to make a concerted effort to ensure that objects only cease to exist once they are positively destroyed? This harkens back to Oderberg’s observation: we witness things ceasing to exist _when and only when_ they are subjected to destructive forces. But this seems wholly mysterious if there is an altogether separate way for such objects to cease to exist (namely, a withdrawal of timeless sustaining activity). If the timeless sustainer genuinely _could_ remove its sustaining activity at any moment of an object’s life, it becomes a mystery why this _never_ seems to occur for objects ( _except_ when and only when the objects are subject to destructive forces—but even in these cases, it is surely the _destructive factors_ , not the withdrawal of timeless sustenance, that explain the object’s cessation).[20]",second clear timeless sustenance view enjoys explanatory advantage seems multiply rather reduce mystery instance timeless-to-temporal explanatory relation consist something timeless cause ground realize whatever temporal thing dynamic view time correct timeless cause change least relational property thereby entailing succession life hence temporality moreover timeless cause seem make concerted effort ensure object cease exist positively destroyed harkens back observation witness thing ceasing exist subjected destructive force seems wholly mysterious altogether separate way object cease exist namely withdrawal timeless sustaining activity timeless sustainer genuinely could remove sustaining activity moment life becomes mystery never seems occur object except object subject destructive forces—but even case surely destructive factor withdrawal timeless sustenance explain cessation,sceptic,1371,0

1963,"WCB,      It's an uncontroversial, well-acknowledged fact of intellectual history that ""critical theory"" is a tradition of thought that emerged out of Marxism and was pioneered by self-avowed Marxists. What else could CRT be invoking with ""Critical"" in the very name but that tradition?      From the Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's page on ""Critical Theory"":      ""According to these theorists, a 'critical' theory may be distinguished from a 'traditional' theory according to a specific practical purpose: a theory is critical to the extent that it seeks human 'emancipation from slavery', acts as a 'liberating … influence', and works 'to create a world which satisfies the needs and powers of' human beings (Horkheimer 1972b [1992, 246]). Because such theories aim to explain and transform all the circumstances that enslave human beings, many 'critical theories in the broader sense have been developed. They have emerged in connection with the many social movements that identify varied dimensions of the domination of human beings in modern societies.      ...While Critical Theory is often thought of narrowly as referring to the Frankfurt School that begins with Horkheimer and Adorno and stretches to Marcuse and Habermas, any philosophical approach with similar practical aims could be called a 'critical theory,' including feminism, critical race theory, and some forms of post-colonial criticism."" (Bohman, 2021, paras. 1-2)      That's what rightwing critics mean when they call CRT ""Marxist"":      ""The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it."" ``-- Karl Marx, Theses on Feuerbach      But go ahead and project onto me and other conservatives that we have been hoodwinked by Fox News and Chris Rufo as you regurgitate the distortions and talking points from leftwing media and activists about this most pernicious of ideologies animating the contemporary left.",wcb uncontroversial well-acknowledged fact intellectual history critical theory tradition thought emerged marxism pioneered self-avowed marxist else could crt invoking critical name tradition standford encyclopedia page critical theory according theorist critical theory may distinguished traditional theory according specific practical purpose theory critical extent seek human emancipation act liberating … work create world satisfies need power human being horkheimer b theory aim explain transform circumstance enslave human being many critical theory broader sense developed emerged connection many social movement identify varied dimension domination human being modern society critical theory often thought narrowly referring frankfurt school begin horkheimer adorno stretch marcuse habermas philosophical approach similar practical aim could called critical theory including feminism critical race theory form post-colonial criticism bohman para - rightwing critic mean call crt marxist philosopher interpreted world various way point change -- karl marx thesis feuerbach go ahead project onto conservative hoodwinked fox news chris rufo regurgitate distortion talking point leftwing medium activist pernicious ideology animating contemporary left,theist,1931,1

I do not believe that the great clock of the cathedral performed in a more passionless and methodical manner its daily routine than did its townsman, Immanuel Kant. Rising in the morning, coffee-drinking, writing, reading lectures, dining, walking, everything had its appointed time, and the neighbors knew that it was exactly half-past three o'clock when Kant stepped forth from his house in his grey, tight-fitting coat, with his Spanish cane in his hand, and betook himself to the little linden avenue called after him to this day the ""Philosopher's Walk."" Summer and winter he walked up and down it eight times, and when the weather was dull or heavy clouds prognosticated rain, the townspeople beheld his servant, the old Lampe, trudging anxiously behind Kant with a big umbrella under his arm, like an image of Providence.      What a strange contrast did this man's outward life present to his destructive, world-annihilating thoughts! In sooth, had the citizens of Königsberg had the least presentiment of the full significance of his ideas, they would have felt far more awful dread at the presence of this man than at the sight of an executioner, who can but kill the body.

It is precisely the question at hand whether form and matter are the sole principles of material substances, since it is precisely the question at hand whether there is an additional principle (or additional fact about reality or temporal concrete objects) which accounts for the persistence of things.

2797,"[1] There may be a sense in which focusing on the _redness_ of the chair as opposed to its _existence_ avoids the problems we raise concerning parts and wholes (and parts’ not being efficient causes of the very being or existence of their wholes). For on some theories of color (e.g., some versions of color realism), color is not _composed_ or _constituted_ by the microchemical properties but is instead _efficiently caused_ by (or realized by, or emergent from, or whatever) them. In response, we note that it’s true that on some theories of color, these will be efficient rather than material causes. But, first, Feser is fundamentally concerned not with the properties of things but instead with the existence of things like the chair. And, indeed, this is precisely the regress he sends us off on in his chapter: parts of coffee ‘actualizing’ the coffee’s existence. Second, if we take this line of response, then we have brought in a deeply controversial account of the nature of color, one present in neither Feser (2017) nor McNabb and DeVito (2020). If a defense against Oppy’s point needs something like this highly controversial account of color, then the Aristotelian proof loses much of its force.

That's why I was very (and still am in some way) very afraid to believe or take something for granted.

This is literally what is being taught in schools, muti national corporations etc. And it's not just white people, any group that has a had any measure of success in the system namely Asians, has been accused of pandering to the so called White Supremacists.

There are also the related points that one could be a heretic in the _material_ sense of affirming something doctrinally erroneous, while not being a _formal_ heretic in the sense of persisting in the error even after being warned by ecclesiastical authority; and that whether some doctrine has actually been defined by the Church is relevant to whether it is “to be believed by divine and Catholic faith.”",one point reader made word “ heresy ” used expansive way earlier church history today correct important something elsewhere emphasized myselfhttpsedwardfeserblogspotcompopes-heresy-and-papal- heresyhtml modern canon law heresy “ obstinate denial obstinate doubt reception baptism truth believed divine catholic faith ” pope honorius definitely heretic sense evidence obstinacy part charitable reading problematic statement support judgment intend undermine traditional teaching even word inadvertently effect also related point one could heretic material sense affirming something doctrinally erroneous formal heretic sense persisting error even warned ecclesiastical authority whether doctrine actually defined church relevant whether “ believed divine catholic faith ”,theist,1204,1

I take it as essential that in LFW *we* are the ones making our choices, in an indeterministic but non-stochastic way; that we cause our actions and do so in such a way that, when we're deliberating, we can really cause one or the other at that moment, and thus under the same set of intrinsic properties.      I say we can reach an agreement and a common conclusion here: you and I have radically different ideas of LFW. So if someone accepts your model, then indeed they will have a problem with God's choice in DS. If someone subscribes to your model of LFW, then that objection to DS is a serious one, and perhaps there is no way around it.      But if someone accepts my model of LFW (or, even more modestly, accepts my model as metaphysically possible) instead, then the problem disappears. Because in my model, the agent can cause either X or ~X without requiring a difference in intrinsic properties for choosing one or the other. It's not unique to God, it's the same for humans, too.      So if someone accepts your model of libertarian freedom (call it LFW1) then the objection is very much alive. Well done. But if someone prefers my model (call it LFW2) instead, the objection isn't really impressive.

2266,"@ Anonymous:       _Hand waving away consciousness by saying it is caused by evolution is the cause of it, you haven't done anything to address the substance of the philosophical arguments about why consciousness is so weird._      Naturalists say that when brains reach a certain level of ""complexity"", they become conscious (something ""emerges""). And what does that mean? That's just the process of **eduction of the substantial form from the potentialities of prime matter,** described by Aquinas 700+ years ago.      That means that the forms (ADN) are in the potency of prime matter (chemicals) and are then drawn out into act through the agency of the efficient cause (the powers existing in the environment). Once you reach the ""threshold of complexity"", the form appears and so do the new properties and powers, like being self-conscious and being capable of abstract thinking.      So naturalists have reached the same conclusion that St. Thomas did. But St. Thomas had a coherent, hyper-extense, detailed up to the point of exhaustion metaphysical system. They claim ""emergence"" but they can not offer an explanation for it, that's why they hide under the cover of ""Natural Selection"" and her wondrous powers. And that's too why they hide under the cover of ""deep time"" as a last ditch effort to look credible. Naturalists, those ""wondrous powers"" pertain to God and only to God.      So for those who say that our system is ""archaic and obsolete"", I respond that the last laugh is on the hylemorphist. A deep, ample, sustained laugh.

That is, in instances where we have the expectation that, given the occurrence of an F, an instance of a G will follow, we have the expectation because our minds have formed an association between instances of Fs and instances of Gs and not because there is any necessity linking Fs to Gs. (Or so goes the standard interpretation of Hume provided in undergraduate classes; addressing whether this is the correct interpretation of Hume is beyond the scope of this post.) David Lewis developed a metaphysical system — that we will call _Humean Supervenience_ — according to which all that ultimately exists are (1) a collection of space- time points and (2) an assignment of qualities to space-time points. Everything else supervenes on the distribution of qualities. Lewis’s program takes inspiration from Hume in that there are no necessary relations between distinct existences, that is, between distinct space-time regions. Causation, laws, and chance are all to be explained in terms of how the distribution of qualities covaries between possible worlds. For example, according to the Best System Account (BSA) of laws, although the distribution of qualities can be _systematized_ or _summarized_ in various ways, the laws are the axioms of the system that captures the best trade off between simplicity and generality.",hume famously argued relation necessary connection distinct existence instance expectation given occurrence f instance g follow expectation mind formed association instance f instance g necessity linking f g go standard interpretation hume provided undergraduate class addressing whether correct interpretation hume beyond scope post david lewis developed metaphysical system — call humean supervenience — according ultimately exists collection space- time point assignment quality space-time point everything else supervenes distribution quality program take inspiration hume necessary relation distinct existence distinct space-time region causation law chance explained term distribution quality covaries possible world example according best system account bsa law although distribution quality systematized summarized various way law axiom system capture best trade simplicity generality,sceptic,1424,0

1793,"Now to top things off, there is a common and sinful calumny that comes from the recent disciples of VB that those who believe that hell is and will be occupied want people to be in hell.

Those who make these calumnious accusations will answer to the judge of the living and the dead whether or not they believe in the final judgement.

2006,"@Tony      In Benedict XVI's Foreword to his book 'Jesus of Nazareth' published during his pontificate, he wrote, 'It goes without saying that this book is in no way an exercise of the magisterium, but is solely an expression of my personal search for the face of the Lord. Everyone is free, then, to contradict me. I would only ask my readers for that initial goodwill without which there can be no understanding.' (It was understood by everyone as being written in his capacity 'as a private theologian'.)      The book had a certain impact around the world of Catholic thought, as he no doubt wished - partly caused by his pre-existing reputation as a theologian, but certainly added to by the simple fact that he was now pope. He wanted to 'teach' people, in a similar way to us wanting to 'teach' each other by posting on this blog - hopefully our motive is that we want to help one another on the path to truth. And he wanted to use his new platform as pope to reach a wider audience.      However, Benedict didn't want Catholics to consider themselves morally bound to accept what he said, just from the mere fact of who it was that said it. I don't think that this was particularly because he was tentative or uncertain about his statements in the book - maybe for some of them he was, others he wasn't. But rather, he wanted in this case to leave acceptance of what he was saying simply up to the free consideration of the individual. He didn't wish to 'bind' anyone.      So, he took off his 'pope' cap and put on his 'private theologian' cap, saying that his writing was solely an expression of his 'personal search for the face of the Lord' (despite presumably being motivated by wanting others to learn from his words and to be influenced by them).      Is that swapping of caps problematic on your view? I'm reading you (maybe) as saying or implying that the assertions of a pope in faith or morals cannot fail to be 'binding' on any Catholic to some extent, whether the pope likes it or not; or maybe that this is so, at least by default. That is (maybe unless the pope explicitly says otherwise, as with Benedict's book), Catholics should consider themselves morally bound to adhere (at least to some degree) to a pope's assertions in faith or morals, merely from the fact of who it is that is asserting them. This would be whether or not they are published in an official document, and whether or not they are promulgated to the whole Church: it is all 'teaching', and by a representative of Christ, and therefore magisterial.      So on this view, the official but private replies of Pope Honorius to Patriarch Sergius would be 'binding' to some extent on any Catholic who learnt of them and their contents.      And the plane interviews of Pope Francis would be to some small degree magisterial (if they concern faith or morals) - calling for our acceptance of his statements from the mere fact of who it is that is speaking and 'teaching'.

2865,"I think an analogy with mechanical or spatial inertia is helpful at this point. Consider: spatial location is almost always (perhaps always) numerically distinct from the essence of the thing occupying said location. A cup, for instance, is distinct from a particular spatial location, since the cup can exist _without_ being located at such a position. (This shows, moreover, that such a spatial location is not even essential to the cup.) But the mere fact that the cup’s particular spatial location is distinct from its essence (and not even included in its essence as one of its essential properties) _doesn’t entail_ that the cup’s being in this particular spatial location (at any moment at which it is _in_ such a location) requires some kind of continuously concurrent external causal ‘keeper’ or ‘sustainer’ of the cup’s being in said location. Indeed, the opposite seems to be the case: we have good reason to think that no such continuously concurrent sustenance is required in order for the cup to simply retain its spatial position. And if this is true of spatial location—which, again, is distinct from the essence of objects (and isn’t even one among their essential properties)—why couldn’t it equally be true of _existence_?",think analogy mechanical spatial inertia helpful point consider spatial location almost always perhaps always numerically distinct essence thing occupying said location cup instance distinct particular spatial location since cup exist without located position show moreover spatial location even essential cup mere fact particular spatial location distinct essence even included essence one essential property entail particular spatial location moment location requires kind continuously concurrent external causal ‘ keeper ‘ sustainer said location indeed opposite seems case good reason think continuously concurrent sustenance required order cup simply retain spatial position true spatial location—which distinct essence object even one among essential properties—why equally true existence,sceptic,1241,0

The difference between the views is that theistic personalists reject divine simplicity and, as a consequence, often reject other classical attributes such as immutability, impassibility, and eternity.

1629,"¡¡¡Cavete!!!   What on earth is going on! Am I the only one to notice this?!   Under the cover of ""upstanding"" right wing politics, various authors are promoting occultism, while spouting edifying Christian vocab left right and centre.      Here's one example. Michael Warren Davis has done the rounds about Catholic places, having been published quite a bit - in First Things, Crisis Magazine, the Catholic Herald. He is out and about elsewhere too - in The Imaginative Conservative, where he declares he can only slightly disagree (on an issue of art and beauty) with the late Roger Scruton. He recommends Scruton's work ""On Hunting"" as ""an account of tradition from the living heart of that tradition"". The living heart of Idealism, more likely! This is the work that defines God as ""the subjectivity of the world""!      This is not what concerned me the most (I've mentioned it here before, but almost nobody seemed to think it of much interest - no doubt they were too busy reading the ST to notice).      Davis has authored a couple of articles at The American Conservative that are extremely dangerous to politicised Catholic conservatives. One of them ""When Witchcraft was Right-Wing"", depicts the witch Gerard Gardner and his followers as typically right wing. Davis doesn't defend devilry, but the article is bizarrely non-committal on this issue. Davis only gets a little emotional when pointing out how modern leftist witches are not true successors of Gardner!      His most recent article in TAC (""War Against the Modern World) definitely joined the dots. It is a shameless defence of ""Traditionalism"", well-known for occultism and virulent anti-Christianity in all its forms.. The only criticism he allows is that Evola is not so nice because Mussolini and Dugin like him, so Evola - bad. But Guenon - good! And looney tunes King Charles loves Guenon, so he's great too. Steve Bannon is somewhere between Guenon and Evola, so Davis says he ain't perfect.      These ""Traditionalists"" are now producing such volumes of material that those with doubts - real Thomists included, must feel it is useless to respond. It shouldn't be so difficult. After all, the dressing up of esoteric ideas with religious imagery is not new. Though Jonathan Pageau's defence of the Kabbala, and the occult, if only as a ""concept"" or aspect of ""Christianity"" was really going a bit far, even for one of ""them"".      The minds of well-meaning readers, including Catholics, need to be warned about Davis and authors like him. How can the conservative media remain silent and obsequious when faced with these characters who are far more dangerous to the faith of conservative readers than Marxism and CRT, etc., which they are obviously not interested in?

This is because—for all Feser has shown—there may very well be a conditional potency within each that accounts for why, when combined with the other, they are able to manifest some further ‘feature’ (namely, a tendency to persist).[8] Consider again the case of the chemical species. The first species will not manifest redness unless the second is present, while the second will not manifest redness unless the first is present. But all this demands is an explanation for why they combined in the first place, since that original composition is what actualized the conditional potencies to transition into a state of actuality. And once the composition’s components have their conditional potencies actualized in the first place, they remain in a state of actuality unless separated by (say) some chemical or physical process.",fourth consider conditional potency arguably although form matter may interdepend respect beginning existence ie respect origination form-matter composition follow thereby interdepend every moment exist because—for feser shown—there may well conditional potency within account combined able manifest ‘ feature namely tendency persist consider case chemical specie first specie manifest redness unless second present second manifest redness unless first present demand explanation combined first place since original composition actualized conditional potency transition state actuality component conditional potency actualized first place remain state actuality unless separated say chemical physical process,sceptic,1139,0

He says that, “whatever is made up of parts is not absolutely one, but in a sense many and other than itself, and it can be broken up either actually or _by the mind_ —all of which things are foreign to” God.[19] Compare a similar statement made by Jacob Arminius in his _25 Public Disputations_ , Disputation IV.XI: “Simplicity is a pre-eminent mode of the Essence of God, by which he is void of all composition, and of component parts whether they belong to the senses or to the understanding.”[20] What this means is that not even conceptual distinctions can apply to the simple God. As Anselm explains, “what either actually or conceptually has parts can be divided into parts, and this is altogether foreign to God.” ( _Incarnation of the Word_ VII).

My point was just that the rightful desire for someone's punishment shouldn't be the make or break with regard to our faith. Maybe there won't ever be an ideal Pope who will uphold everything. As I mentioned in the above example, it's possible that one may get a Pope who is orthodox in all respects except for the death penalty where he is inspired by NNLT.      While being a part of the Church on Earth, Our faith should extend beyond this world to the Church in Heaven.      God will decide who gets punished and who won't, maybe that might be in our accordance with our judgement or maybe it won't.      But our faith should remain steady nevertheless.

When it suits his interests, he will appeal to orthodox Christian tradition, and claim that his own views are more consistent with it than those of his opponents. But in other cases, he will dismiss the standard criteria of Christian orthodoxy and appeal instead to merits that his views purportedly exhibit independently of questions of orthodoxy. As I there argued, Hart’s approach isn’t, at the end of the day, that of a Christian theologian. Rather, it is that of a theologian who happens to have been influenced by Christian tradition, but whose ultimate criteria are to be found elsewhere. The considerations raised by Fr.

2473,"Perhaps friends of simultaneous causation could instead object by appealing to empirically indistinguishable alternatives to relativity that reinstate absolute time. If absolute time can be reinstated, then the intuitive notion of causes concurring with their effects can be reinstated. For our purposes in this post, we make two observations. First, alternatives to relativity remain deeply controversial. So long as relativistic orthodoxy remains a live option, the possibility that causes do not concur with their effects remains a live option. And, for that reason, transtemporal accounts of existential inertia remain live. Second, the objection concerns alternatives to relativity that are empirically indistinguishable from relativity, at least within some domain. In any case in relativity’s domain of application where we can detect a relationship between a cause and an effect, theories that are empirically indistinguishable from relativity must have the same observational consequences as relativity.

2159,"The famous paragraph slipped into the Fourth Council of Constantinople’s deliberations had more to do with the inflamed politics of the East than the wrongs of Pope Honorius. The Lateran Council of 649, rejecting Monothelitism, had blamed the orientals, making no mention of Pope Honorius. Pope Agatho got his legates to bring to the Council of Constantinople a letter in which he stated: “From the day when the leaders of the Church of Constantinople tried to introduce heretical novelties in the immaculate Church of Christ, my predecessors never ceased to exhort them… that they had to abstain… [from proclaiming the error concerning the single will etc.]”.      The Council’s machinations contradicted Pope Agatho and resulted in a wording that was modified by Pope Leo II (upon receiving notice of its deliberations) when he ratified it. This was the version he then sent to Constantinople and all the bishops of the West. Pope Leo, in his explanation of the affair to the bishops of Spain, clearly distinguished between the list of heretics named by the Council, and Pope Honorius, censured for being negligent.         In a long article in the Dictionnaire de theolgie catholique (1931, the DTC was in another league entirely from the estimable Catholic Encyclopedia), Fr. E. Amann, professor of theology at Strasbourg, concludes: “For us, the two letters of Pope Honorius represent a doctrinal intervention of the Roman pontiff in a debated question: referring to previous decisions, without adding anything new to them except in manner, the pope teaches the theory of the two natures, each operating according to what is proper to it, and demands entire acceptance of this doctrine. Alongside this doctrinal teaching is a very unfortunate prescription on the silence to be kept relative to the formulas in dispute, ‘one or two energies’”.      He concludes that “… [Honorius’] thought carries greater weight than the formulas by which he expresses it, that these formulas themselves can with the greatest rigor uphold an interpretation which does not deviate too much from official orthodoxy. But to conclude from this, as many theologians have done, the perfect orthodoxy of the two letters of Honorius, there is, it seems, some distance.”      Had the Council made a dangerous mistake? “It would certainly have done so if, taking the question from an exclusively dogmatic point of view, it had passed a doctrinal and pointless judgment on the very teaching of Honorius….[because Honorius was basically orthodox, despite his expressions in these letters] the assembly set itself up as judge much less of a theology than of a type of conduct and those who engaged in it”.      The weak arguments made by some theologians mentioned in the post do not devalue their stronger ones – which don’t get a proper mention; the question of the Pope losing the faith, the issue of formal heresy dealt with by Bellarmine, surely deserves some explanation. As far as the history goes, Pope Honorius was NOT a heretic, and Fr. Chapman’s 100 page work does not establish it.      I think there is a distinction between ex cathedra infallibility (which permits no stain of error) and the foibles of Popes at other times which, however much destruction they cause, does not translate into meaning they can lose the faith. Obviously we aren’t expected to believe that off the cuff “magisterium” on planes is not free from tendentiousness to the point of destructive favouring of whatever error is in fashion. That the man doing this will not lose the faith, ever, is in line with what Vatican One defined concerning the Faith of the See of Rome that would not fail until the end of time. Reducing this to the extraction of ex cathedra statements one a century from men who could otherwise have no faith, or renounce Christ, seems more like the speech of Balaam’s ass.

2593,"Why do I say P(F|CTST) << 1? Consider that for an object to persist for about 116 days is for it to persist approximately 10,000,000 seconds. And consider that there are about 1044 Planck times in one second, and hence to persist for about 116 days is to persist for about 1051 Planck times. Now, for each (possible) Plank time in an object’s life, God is free to sustain the object for that Planck time or refrain from so sustaining it, and this is true even if God has sustained the object through previous Planck times. (It’s not as though God suddenly becomes forced or compelled to continue sustaining an object, and it’s not as though some moral obligation is newly imposed on him, or whatever. These are unacceptable by the classical theist’s lights.) This entails that for a given world w in which an object persists for (at least) 116 days and is then causally destroyed by something, there are about 1051 worlds in which that object ceases to exist at some point earlier than w due to God’s withdrawal of sustenance. Moreover, under classical theism, God remains utterly invariant across all worlds, and hence there is no difference or variance on God’s end to which one could point in _any_ such world to explain why **_it_** came about as opposed to some **_other_** world. Thus, conditional on CTST, the expectation that w obtains—that is, that the single world in which the object persists for 116 days (upon which it is finally causally destroyed) obtains rather than any of the other 1051 worlds—is very small. And hence the data of F, as applied to this 116-day-lived object, is very unlikely conditional on CTST, whereas its probability is 1 conditional on EIT. And hence EIT garners very strong evidential confirmation from F vis-à- vis CTST.

2973,"[12] There are criticisms of something like existential inertia in Kvanvig and McCann (1988). I have not considered them in this post for several reasons, foremost among them being that I’m not convinced that they’re actually criticisms of existential inertia _as such_. Kvanvig and McCann are explicit that they only criticize the thesis that there is some positive ontological item within a temporal substance—a _self-sustaining capacity_ —whose operation ensures or explains or otherwise maintains the persistent existence of the substance. But few if any of the metaphysical accounts of Section 5 require positing a self-sustaining capacity of this sort, and it is certainly not inherent to or required by EIT _as such_. (Beaudoin 2007 also addresses Kvanvig and McCan’s points.) I have also not addressed Feser’s (2011) claim that (at least some of) the five ways themselves represent arguments against EIT. Here are some reasons for this. First: I have already addressed the first way elsewhere, and in the next sub-section I’ll be considering the Aristotelian proof’s demand for a sustaining cause. I will also address what Feser says on behalf of the demand for sustaining causes in his essence- existence or De Ente-esque argument (i.e., his Thomistic proof) as well as what Feser says on behalf of the demand for sustaining causes based on contingency (i.e., his Rationalist proof). What I say therein applies _mutatis mutandis_ to Feser’s claim that the first three ways constitute arguments against EIT, since Feser gives the second and third ways essence-existence and contingency interpretations (respectively). And I don’t find the fourth or fifth ways plausible. Second: I find Feser’s claim deeply implausible, given that the renditions in question of the five ways have premises that—by my lights—simply _assume_ , rather than _justify_ , the falsity of EIT.",criticism something like existential inertia kvanvig mccann considered post several reason foremost among convinced actually criticism existential inertia kvanvig mccann explicit criticize thesis positive ontological item within temporal substance—a self-sustaining capacity —whose operation ensures explains otherwise maintains persistent existence substance metaphysical account section require positing self-sustaining capacity sort certainly inherent required eit beaudoin also address kvanvig point also addressed claim least five way represent argument eit reason first already addressed first way elsewhere next sub-section considering aristotelian demand sustaining cause also address feser say behalf demand sustaining cause essence- existence de ente-esque argument ie thomistic proof well feser say behalf demand sustaining cause based contingency ie rationalist proof say therein applies mutatis mutandis claim first three way constitute argument eit since feser give second third way essence-existence contingency interpretation respectively find fourth fifth way plausible second find claim deeply implausible given rendition question five way premise that—by lights—simply assume rather justify falsity eit,sceptic,1876,0
1935," _in the misbegotten attempt of thinking that such a strategy will drag Catholic thought into the mainstream from the periphery,_      That's just plain goofy, stupid nonsense.

Charging Feser with this as his motive is just plain idiotic.      If Feser has not credibly identified the real Catholic response to CRT, then his attack on CRT cannot be identified with ""Catholicism"" anyway. If, however, Feser has credibly identified the real Catholic response to CRT, then he won't be **_dragging_** Catholic thought anywhere, mainstream or not.

If you take this position, you are stuck with a conception of matter that makes it impossible to regard consciousness as material. The solution, I would say, is simply not to go along with this assumption in the first place, but to return to the Aristotelian-Scholastic view the early moderns reacted against, and which is compatible with the commonsense view of matter. The so-called hard problem of consciousness then dissolves.""

All 'compelling reason' means is that it was a reason good enough due to its intrinsic merits that one acted on it. Because of this, while it is true that our creation shows that God had no compelling reason not to create, it is trivially true -- all it is saying is that God's making choice A shows that He didn't decide to act on the intrinsic merits of any reasons He might have had for choice B. It doesn't tell us anything about whether He had good reasons for choice B.

Second, Leo did confirm the council, and thereby lent authority to its decrees. And those decrees explicitly condemn Honorius as a heretic.

And I want to confess something: even though I do not think that something like that (buddhism) is plausible at all, I am afraid of the possibility that it could be because I am ignorant and my OCD does not let me go through this. It was a lot hard to write all these comments - since I am struggling with myself to even conclude a thought. There were a lot more - and a lot more detailed criticism - that I want to write but I simply can't (especially a topic at 4.5 that's the most important part of all it but I don't have the necessary strength and a point that I tried to make à-la Aristotelian retortion in the sense that they must presuppose permanence and can't get rid of it in making their arguments in the same way that Alex Rosenberg can't get rid of intentionality when trying to 'naturalize intentionality').      And for those of you who think: ""why buddhism bothers you that much?"" The answer should be self-evident by now (and for reasons that make simple materialism looks like a weekend at the beach): look at the consequences of all that. There would be no persons, no things, and in some way just suffering. Life would be just horrible. There would be illusions all around us. All persons would be substances per accident - and that's just awful and I can't believe that there are people who find this idea pleasing. And the other reason is OCD. Looks like nothing that I could present by myself is ever sufficient to disprove them. Looks like my arguments are never enough - and since I'm just illiterate in philosophy there is a wall I could never cross.      Unfortunately, I came across buddhism by chance when I was fixated on the experiment of Benjamin Libet on free will (at least his sense of ""free will"") and stumbled across the work of Sam Harris arguing that since there was no free will there is the illusion of the self. Since I have OCD things don't 'go out' of my head that easily (like in the case of normal people). Since the idea per se is insane I tried to understand why people think that it's plausible in the first place. And by their paradoxical 'reductio' way of arguing and the abuse of science that they always propose (bearing in mind that I didn't know that there is such a thing as A-T Meta at the time) that stuck in my head and only got worse through the years.

I could notice btw a lot of gaps and things that I think were wrong with that nefast metaphysics - but I'm incapable to fight on my own and understanding things (you know, philosophy is hard. The fear of misinterpreting them due to a possible fallacy by my part or that they got some ""magic argument"" that I don't know and could just flip my refutation, etc. ).      I tried to engage against those arguments from impermanence, they're ontology and etc. by applying the methods of retorsion that Ed taught in the first chapter of Scholastic's Meta. There are a lot of similarities or so I think between Heraclitus and the Buddhists - after all, they both can't live for more than a second. But due to all my trauma and the fact that I felt so uncomfortable just by reading and thinking about it (my symptoms goes from headache, sleepiness, and weakness to fever). And all the other things like ""what if they have some argument that I don't know that could prove that I'm wrong'', ""what if I'm reading them wrong"" (even though I thought I'm somehow not), ""what if they have some way to turn around that argument from Aristotle in some way"" and all that stuff. But by now the more I try to confront this I'm simply mentally incapable and it's been almost 3 years of living that way. I don't have much more forces. My only hope is that someday some professional philosopher as formidable, careful, and badass as Ed could discuss this thing pointing out not just how it's wrong but that it can't even be right, to begin with, so I can finally put all that pain to rest.

First, one might question whether there even _is_ such a fundamental, ultimate ground layer of physical reality. That’s a good question, but it misunderstands the dialectical context at hand. Feser is aiming to give a _positive demonstration_ of NPCP. One of the approaches he takes to justifying this is _step three_ (as we’ve outlined it), which appeals to (purportedly) clear cases of composite objects’ being sustained in being by a pre-existent physical context. But as we argued in the previous paragraph, one clear way to circumvent this justification is to hold that there _is_ such a fundamental, ground layer to physical reality that provides a context for less fundamental physical realities but does not itself have some more fundamental physical context. Given that this circumvents step three, it follows that the success of step three as a justification for NPCP _presupposes_ that there couldn’t be such a fundamental, ground layer as we’ve described it. The onus of justification is therefore on _Feser_ to justify why there couldn’t be such a layer. Without such justification, step three rests on an unjustified presupposition.",one might juncture raise worry last example two worry one might level first one might question whether even fundamental ultimate ground layer physical reality good question misunderstands dialectical context hand feser aiming give positive demonstration npcp one approach take justifying step three outlined appeal purportedly clear case composite sustained pre-existent physical context argued previous paragraph one clear way circumvent justification hold fundamental ground layer physical reality provides context le fundamental physical reality fundamental physical context given circumvents step three follows success step three justification npcp presupposes fundamental ground layer described onus justification therefore feser justify layer without justification step three rest unjustified presupposition,sceptic,1253,0

The fact that I am now a Catholic is evidence that I don’t think it’s a problem. It’s of course a very difficult thing, and the argument is not in any way whatsoever that we should just ignore suffering in others, to be indifferent to it. Quite the opposite, doing the small bit we can to help those suffering in their different ways is part of what we are asked to do. This is why I describe it as a necessary part of our complete creation, and not as a good in itself. Of course us normal Catholics don’t envy the suffering in others. However those who have the deepest relationship with God do often become keen to suffer themselves, so that they can ‘take up their cross’ and share in the sacrifice of God incarnate.

Now this leaves me with some questions. Now keep in mind that if you try to communicate back, I will not understand as I have not seen your Truman show. However, since you have seen mine, I know that you will understand the points I am driving at by my questions. This will give you some food for thought while you are in your cage.      The first question is: could you tell us what study has identified the three movements of the intellect (understanding, judgement, syllogism) with particular elements on the periodic table? And, which elements are associated with which movement? And if not elements, perhaps compounds? If so, which compounds are associated with which movements? And is it that the compound has to be located in the person, or in the brain, or in a particular place in the brain at a particular time to have a particular thought? And if the compound present in one person when they think that thought, how do you know that this compound is *causing* the thought? Or are you identifying it with the thought? And how do you know it does not merely correspond with the thought rather than causing it or being identified with it? And if it were causing the thought or identified with it in *this person* how do you know that the same occurs in all people? If a certain element, compound, or process is associated with a thought in person A, how do you know that this occurs in all people in the world? And if it does not occur with all people in the world, how can you reduce understanding of some concept or some judgement with a particular element, compound or process?      These are just a few questions for you to chem on in your cage. Given how important evidence is to you, I am sure that you have evidential answers to all of these questions. If not, that would again show you to be a complete hypocrite and from your posts and our interaction, I know that this cannot be so....      Or perhaps you would tell us that you know none of the answers to these questions and that we just need to trust you that you are correct anyways. Well, given your omniscience about the upbringing of everyone on here that you interact with, that makes all the sense in the world.

2247,"@ Tadeo,      I cannot speak for Ed, but I was not arguing for or against natural selection per se. I disentangle truth and natural selection, as science, through my idea that, since a random sequence is a valid image of God, and since we know through quantum mechanics that there is such a thing as a random sequence, a random sequence, being without rules, is a very simple image of God, who also is without rules.      But God is greater than this or any other image, and is in no way limited by this image. So questions about consciousness do not restrict this image. What it is useful for, to we humans, is to show that we cannot calculate, with our mathematical science, what God's acts will be or are, since we cannot calculate a number (a sequence) whose digits are without a rule (are random), and, since God is truth, this separates truth from natural selection. In short, it is beyond our understanding (at least for me) to know whether natural selection is actual science, although as a theory of science, as Ed said in the video, (""natural selection favors fitness"") it explains adaption to the environment of survivors.      I can't see how your question can give a different answer without assumption, so I can't see it as a real question because the answer is either beyond our understanding, or follows from the arbitrary assumptions in its formulation.

To quote Pope Benedict XVI from God is With Us from the chapter God’s Yes and His Love Are Maintained Even in Death      ""The very heart of the faith has been lost to anyone who supposes that it is only worthwhile, if it is, so to say, made worthwhile by the damnation of others. Such a way of thinking, which finds the punishment of other people necessary, springs from not having inwardly accepted the faith; from loving only oneself and not God the Creator, to whom his creatures belong. That way of thinking would be like the attitude of those people who could not bear the workers who came last being paid a denarius like the rest; like the attitude of people who feel properly rewarded only if others have received less. This would be the attitude of the son who stayed at home, who could not bear the reconciling kindness of his father. It would be a hardening of our hearts, in which it would become clear that we were only looking out for ourselves and not looking for God; in which it would be clear that we did not love our faith, but merely bore it like a burden.""      End quote      To forestall some usual tired objections, obviously this doesn't deny the reality of hell or the reality that some human beings will go to hell or the reality of punishment. These Truths are obvious from Christ's clear words where he says ""Many will not be Able"". (Although on the question of relative numbers and percentages, I am inclined to agree with Cardinal Avery Dulles where he mentioned that God hasn't provided any such stats or figures like more then 50% etc. Those who interpret the narrow path and wide path in that way are free to do so but other interpretations such as taking it to be a practical warning and not as a prediction are legitimate opinions, The pratical warning interpretation is taken by Pope Benedict XVI in ""God and The World "" under the question ""Two Roads"". As in the Book of Revelations, John mentioned he saw an innumerable crowd of people.)         The main point I am trying to make here is that, looking forward to people's punishments isn't healthy and shouldn't be encouraged. You shouldn't comfort people who is faith has been shaken by ambiguous statements by saying ""don't worry, those who made those statements will be brutally punishment"".

1601,"@ the emperor with no clothes      Okay, Walter, now that we have established that the emperor is walking around in the buff, let's try to put some clothes back on him.      You wrote:      ""theism cannot explain the rules of logic either and cannot take them as seperate entities because there are no entities that are truly seperate from God.""      As I pointed out above, theism is not pantheism, so you need to work on that distinction between credible, reliable witnesses and non-credible witnesses in order to have better discernment about who to listen to about what is or is not ""Theism"". Now that we have cleared this up, we can address the final false statement in your response (You squeezed in quite a few in that little post).      You claimed that theism has no means of accounting for the rules of logic. Well, you got that one wrong as well. Theism is the *only* means of accounting for the rules of logic. Let's recap on where we have gotten so far. It is clear, for reasons noted above, that the laws of logic exist. Anyone making an argument presupposes this. It is also clear, for reasons noted above, that the laws of logic are not material. Walter does not have them buried in his basement (In fact if they were anywhere, it is clear from the foregoing that they are not at Walter's house).      So, we have laws that exist and are immaterial. Along with this, these laws do not change from place to place or over time. They are eternal. They are not contingent on change in the material world. Yet these laws, just like numbers, have real implications in the material world.      The principle of non-contradiction is not *merely* a principle of thought. It also permeates material being. It is for this reason that no one has ever seen a non-chair-chair or a square circle or a married bachelor. They are impossible to conceptualize and they are impossible to be (or exist).      So, if these principles effect being and yet seem also to be mind dependent, how else do we account for them except by an eternal mind? Now Mr. Walter, if you have read your Edward Feser, you should be having flashbacks at this point because Dr. Feser makes precisely this argument with regard to numbers and other abstract objects in Five Proofs. He aptly refers to it as the Augustinian argument. Now we have cleared up the last of your string of misunderstandings. In the future, perhaps you might pause and reflect on whether or not it is cogent to try to convince us that your keyboard does not exist by means of typing on it.      Now, Mr. Don Jindra.

However we generally make the choice there, we understand how it helps our health. What about a young child forced not to ride it’s tricycle on a busy road, or to take some bad tasting medicine. In these cases most children don’t understand the end good. A few children may trust their parents, and so for them (and there parents!) it’s not really a problem. For others, the hurt and pain they feel at the unfairness of it all often causes them far more problems than the bad taste or the limited cycling options.      “That's like the fire brigade.

2213,"Thank you for this much needed and helpful post.      @Infinite Growth:      St. Paul did not forbid all judgement. If he did, he would not have written in 1 Corinthians 5:3, ""For I, on my part, thought absent in body but present in spirit have already judged him who has so so committed this, as though I were present.""      St. Paul is referred to a man who is sleeping with his father's wife whom the Corinthians have not rebuked out of a disordered tolerance that is so well described in Feser's post above.      Some of the distinctions in the post that are also found in St. Thomas are helpful to determine in what conditions a judgement can be made without being rash. One important distinction is between an exterior act (someone's actions which we can see) and an interior act (an inward intention which only God can see). You can judge an act and recognize that it is wrong without attributing to the person malice. The person may be acting wrongly out of ignorance and this is significantly less culpable than malice. In that instance, you could approach someone calmly and explain to them why the exterior act was not moral. This would be an act of mercy that the Church calls ""Instructing the ignorant."" Again you can do this without assuming that the person is either malicious or an imbecile. In fact, to instruct someone actually presumes goodwill. It presumes that they care about the truth and that if you take the time to explain the truth, that they will be inclined to follow it.      So, we have to make distinctions about what being judged and this can help us from making assumptions about intentions which we cannot be sure of without knowing someone's character and habits. This does not prevent us from judging the exterior acts of anyone even if we don't know them. Nor does it prevent us from assessing their assertions even if we don't know them.      It is also important to highlight that we can get to know someone's character and can make judgement's on that. In this, we just have to be much more careful and, again, err on the side of charity for their good and ours. However, if someone habitually steals or commits adultery or lies, we don't have to pretend that they have a good character when it is obvious that they don't.

Now, in response to _this_ point, Gel suggests restricting IoI to substances. Setting aside the seemingly _ad hoc_ nature of this restriction, my criticism still stands in another guise: namely, it provides an _undercutting defeater_ for the explicability- based motivation for the restricted IoI. Once we grant that there is primitive individuation (even among properties), we seem to lose any compelling explicability-based reason for thinking that primitive individuation among substances is impossible. (What’s the relevant difference between substances and properties in virtue of which the former, but not the latter, cannot be primitively individuated? For me, no answer presents itself upon reflection.)

(Even if one doesn’t so affix a necessity operator, certain metaphysical accounts (e.g., objectual and propositional necessity accounts) themselves provide metaphysical necessity as an explanatory avenue.)

The choice to do X is different from the choice to do ~X because the effects are different, but if Libertarian Freedom is to work, the two effects could indeterministically come about from the same cause without any difference of intrinsic properties in it. If there was a difference which was associated only with X (and another with ~X) then that would entail that the agent would have already chosen either X or ~X, since he would have the corresponding property for one or the other. And if he has already chosen, he is no longer choosing.      Again: you at t in state S can cause either X or ~X. Do you not see how this is required for LFW?   If in order to cause X you had to be in S1 and to cause ~X you had to be in S2, then if you were in S1 you would not be able to cause ~X, and hence would not be able to choose between X and ~X.

2552,"This response, though, doesn’t work. First, from the fact that it is not natural for x to exist—i.e., it is not of x’s very nature to exist—it doesn’t follow that it is not natural for x to _persist once in existence_. Even granting Kerr’s other points, all he has shown is that an essence-existence composite does not _exist by default_. But it’s an entirely separate question whether, _once in existence_ , it _persists_ by default. And, indeed, this is precisely what at least some tendency-disposition accounts affirm: even though there may be nothing about x itself that demands that x _exists_ , there _is_ something about x that demands that— _once it exists_ —it persists absent destruction. One might retort that x’s existence is _continuously_ distinct from x’s essence, in which case x is _continuously_ non-existent by default. But the inertialist attracted to the tendency-disposition account in question can make two replies. First, the inertialist can reject that continuous-non- existence-by-default follows from continuous-distinction-between-essence-and- existence, _precisely because_ things enjoy a natural tendency to persist. For if things enjoy such a tendency, then while they may be non-existent by default, they will _persist_ by default even if their essence and existence are continuously distinct.[6] Second, _even if_ continuously-non-existent-by- default followed from continuous-distinction-between-essence-and-existence, the inertialist can say that that this only implies that if x is to continually _exist_ , there needs to be some _explanation_ for such continuance.

2145,"(continued from previous 2 posts)      With this in mind, take the question now to the issue of future Popes making judgments about the views of previous popes. As Vatican I notes, we might ask if a future Pope could override the judgment of a previous Pope as to whether that previous view was indeed heretical or not. Indeed, this might even hold to the previous Pope's own views. BUT, it is still hard to see how one could judge that the previous pope was FORMALLY heretical, since he presumably would not have taken his own view to be heretical. Could a future pope judge that a previous pope really did know his view to be heretical, etc.?      This raises some very thorny issues indeed. It seems to me that this could not occur because as I understand it, part of the process of declaring someone a formal heretic is that the person is confronted by the authority with a judgment of heresy, and obstinately persists in his views. Obviously, this cannot happen for someone who is deceased.      Another difficulty of course is that if we say future popes can override the judgment of prior popes, then we would also have to hold that an even later pope could override THAT judgment, and so on. BUT, given that we hold that Popes are bound by magisterial teaching, one might ask how this could happen. Or, are popes bound only by magisterial teaching, and not by all previous magisterial juridical decisions, etc.? If we hold that juridical judgments are not infallible (even if they are authoritative in their time), then it seems one could, in theory, later remove the anathemas of Honorius, or whatever. (It certainly seems in other cases a future pope could override earlier papal juridical decisions--e.g., we can conceive of a person excommunicated being reinstated in the church by a future pope, and so on--does this change when the decisions are concretized in conciliar declarations, etc.?

2116,"Hi Ed,      You write that ""Honorius, unlike Agatho, was capable of erring in his own letter because he was not there speaking ex cathedra."" I have to say that this statement is anachronistic. The term ""ex cathedra"" dates from the Middle Ages, and the modern doctrine of papal infallibility was first proposed by bishop Guido Terreni in 1332. To be sure, the formula of Hormisdas (519) declares that ""in the Apostolic See the Catholic religion has always been kept unsullied,"" but (a) it was written before Honorius became Pope, (b) it refers to the Apostolic See, not the Roman Pope, and (c) it says nothing about there being different categories of papal pronouncements (reformable and irreformable).      You also suggest that in the case of a future Pope who, while not speaking ex cathedra, nevertheless teaches error, the Church ""will come to judge harshly any pope who fomented such a crisis."" I'm not so sure. The reason why the third ecumenical council of Constantinople (680-681) was able to condemn Pope Honorius was precisely because its bishops had never been handpicked by him, whereas today, all bishops in the Latin Church are appointed by the Pope, and typically, most of the Cardinals who will elect the next Pope were handpicked by the current one. Thus it appears extremely unlikely that the bishops, speaking in unison, will judge any Pope harshly.

1786,"Vincent, I fear your new theory is just the same as the Aristotelian thesis but in different words. You still have levels of being and now some actualities are grounded in other “actualities.” Form is the source of a things defined properties, matter is the source of its ability to have other properties. If you scrap matter for just another kind of form then you have a Parmenedian static universe. If this conclusion doesn’t follow from your new conception of “levels of actuality” then you’re really just describing potency.      Potency is not mysterious, it’s almost the exact same meaning as when average men say something has “potential.” And I highly disagree that essence and existence are artificial.      The ancients like Plato and Aristotle were much better at being in touch with intuitive knowledge and deepening their understanding of what is already implicit in our mind (I.e. growing of wisdom) rather than the contemporary philosophical practice of over-analyzing to the point of doubting the obvious. The contemporary philosopher is rigorously trained to over-analyze and cut himself off from the original source of information (e.g.Descartes, Kant, pansyschism, etc.), so I caution against the accusation that Plato, Aristotle, or Aquinas were mysterious or artificial in their thinking when it is probably us who are blind.

About the problem of evil, i dont remember Plato adressing it at all*, but he believed that:      \- the soul is living in a innatural condition when stuck in the body      \- that the soul is only happy when it goes to the intellectual goods, which every soul has the potential to do.      \- that after death the soul just goes eventually to another body      It seems that these premises do help developing a response to the problem of evil. Proclus,probably the best neoplatonist, did make a interesting little book on it, worth a reading.      *makes sense that the hebrews would know it(see the Torah and Job) before him, the gods that the atheists/agnostics of his time were discussing were the greek ones, so it would not come from they, and Plato was not only a elitist but also probably a ascetic, hardly the guy to care about lower people not having material goods",wcb since read law plato argues - existence god cosmological argument lead existence soul - self mover - started movement - god care u pointing better caretaker care detail work god care everything argument come book x dont remember good workman argument sound reasonable one accept premise like kant moral argument hard dismiss agree initial premise atheist problem evil dont remember plato adressing believed - soul living innatural condition stuck body - soul happy go intellectual good every soul potential - death soul go eventually another body seems premise help developing response problem evil proclusprobably best neoplatonist make interesting little book worth reading make sense hebrew would know itsee torah job god atheistsagnostics time discussing greek one would come plato elitist also probably ascetic hardly guy care lower people material good,theist,1528,1

By way of response, note first that even if Schmid’s account works only under discrete time, it would still be significant if there were a workable metaphysical account of existential inertia assuming discrete time.[9] Second, according to Schmid, the account is not (after all) essentially tied to discrete time.

2400,"**First** , Gel is here resisting the need for individuating properties that explain why the properties _rectangularity_ and _circularity_ are distinct. And his resistance, it seems, is based on the fact that the properties in question are self-evidently distinct and hence don’t need a further explanation for their distinction. The problem with this rejoinder, though, is that _substances are also self-evidently distinct from one another_. To see this, notice that _p_ ’s self-evidence to subject S requires that S grasps the natures of the things reported in _p_. (For instance, that Euclidean triangles have interior angles summing to 180 degrees is not self-evident to my 2-year- old nephew, since he lacks the relevant knowledge about the essences of triangles, degrees, etc. But once one grasps the relevant natures or essences, one thereby _sees_ the relevant truth. This is part of what it is to be _self- evident_.) So, if S doesn’t grasp the natures of _rectangularity_ and _circularity_ , their distinction won’t be self-evident to S. Gel’s response therefore requires a background grasp of the natures of the realities in question. But here’s the rub: with a background grasp of the natures of indiscernible substances A and B, it is _also_ self-evident that A and B are distinct. For part of the nature of any entity is that it is _that particular entity, distinct from other particular entities._[4] Hence, upon grasping the nature of A (say), we would immediately see that it’s distinct from B. But in that case, Gel’s rejoinder here does more harm than good to his case, for his rejoinder _also_ implies that there needn’t be any further explanation for the distinction between _substances_ —in which case, my criticism of the explicability-based motivation for IoI is vindicated.",first gel resisting need individuating property explain property rectangularity circularity distinct resistance seems based fact property question self-evidently distinct hence need explanation distinction problem rejoinder though substance also self-evidently distinct one another see notice p self-evidence subject requires grasp nature thing reported p instance euclidean triangle interior angle summing degree self-evident -year- old nephew since lack relevant knowledge essence triangle degree etc one grasp relevant nature essence one thereby see relevant truth part self- evident grasp nature rectangularity circularity distinction self-evident response therefore requires background grasp nature reality question rub background grasp nature indiscernible substance b also self-evident b distinct part nature entity particular entity distinct particular entity hence upon grasping nature say would immediately see distinct b case rejoinder harm good case rejoinder also implies explanation distinction substance —in case criticism explicability-based motivation ioi vindicated,sceptic,1798,0

1811,"@anonymous.      What does or does not ""seem heretical"" to you is not the criteria by which something is or is not heretical. The position you are describing is a position that has been condemned by the Church. Pope Pius IX condemened the following proposition in the the Syllabus of Errors: ""Good hope at least is to be entertained of the eternal salvation of all those who are not at all in the true Church of Christ"" (17). This condemnation draws from a previous encyclical entitled Quanto Conficiamur.      So the suggestion that there is good reason to hope for the salvation of all men has been condemned by the Church. Balthasar was aware of this and would not have gone so far as to say that we have good reason to hope for the salvation of everyone. To make this assertion is again to affirm what the Church has condemned.      Where does this leave the position of Balthasar? It leaves him with a hope that is based neither in reason nor in revelation. It leaves him with an irrational hope. That is the problem with the position: it is rooted neither in reason nor revelation.      In the Tradition, the overwhelming weight of the Church Fathers is against the positions of Gregory of Nyssa and Origen and a couple of clever theologians do not overturn the weight of a broad range of Church Fathers that includes a great number of doctors of the Church.      It certainly doesn't overturn the words of Christ that ""the way is narrow and *few will find it*"" (Mt. 7:14). These words are not taken seriously by those in the Balthasar camp. Balthasar's position on this issue was influenced by the reformed theologian Karl Barth. Such theologians have an account of election that has little place for human freedom and secondary causality. They read salvation as though God will save us without us. This is not the Catholic position. The Catholic position is that we need to cooperate with God's grace to be saved.      So, the Balthasarian position in order to remain orthodox on this point would have to posit that we should hope that everyone in history has, is, and will cooperate with God's grace. Well, we might ask the disciples of Balthasar, what reason do we have for thinking that everyone in the world has, is, and will cooperate with God's grace? Oh, you don't have a good reason to think that? Well why in the world would I hold a position that has no rational basis and is widely rejected by the Church Fathers? Why would I hold a position that is so manifestly contrary to the state of our corrupt society?

So it's nice to know that - even though it's hard to imagine how in one act - God is listening to my prayers. But I won't lose my faith.      In case you guys were curious about that it has to do with things that happened before I meet Ed's blog. My life - my family - life has always been pretty harsh. And to worsen all that I have OCD. My grandmother on my father- side died of Alzheimer and I'm afraid that my father would develop that too. My mother lost her job due to an injustice that happened to her during the pandemic and all that bullshit.      But the worst thing that doesn't seem to go away is the depression and trauma that my OCD contributed to. I was very very influenced by Libet's ''experiment'' back then and unfortunately, I acknowledge a fella named Sam Harris with all that mysticism about 'no self' etc. (that seemed to follow from the experiment's conclusion), and since then that stuck in my head - not because I believed it - even though I had a weak spot for materialism and 'took it for granted' because you know ''science'' mentality that I was influenced to. The problem was (somehow still) the fact that I didn't even know how to defend myself from all that (i.e that the experiment methods were bogus, that the rest doesn't necessarily follow from it). And the implication with all of that in my life was the fact that if that is true, life is simply worse than it seems. There is just pain and suffering. What weighed more than one hundred pounds for me was the fact that I simply love my mom and my family and if there was no free will, no God, and we were somehow unreal because there was no self (nothing that lasts or abides)... I don't need to paint the rest of the picture to see how evil, atrocious, and how I felt and still feel because I have nightmares and traumas with that till nowadays.      In the midway path between that, I found Ed's blog and began to read it - even emailed him one time. And that gave me hope that there was a God after all and that those things could be false.      But even so, buddhist claims from Harris traumatized me a lot and due to my OCD, I still suffer from them till today. Deep there, I confess I'm really afraid that something evil like that is possibly true. Because it's an even worse version of materialism with all its adorns.

2290,"Where the study of consciousness is concerned, recent philosophy of mind has followed David Chalmers in distinguishing between “easy problems” and the “hard problem.” Identifying the neural correlates of various kinds of conscious awareness would be examples of an easy problem. By characterizing such a problem as “easy,” Chalmers doesn’t mean that it is trivial, or even easy in every respect. He just means that it is the sort of problem the solution to which seems clearly attainable using existing methods and standard scientific and philosophical assumptions. The “hard problem” is explaining why any of the neural processes in question are associated with conscious awareness, given that it seems at least prima facie possible that they could do what neuroscience describes them as doing in the complete absence of consciousness. (This is alleged to be shown by arguments like Chalmers’ [“zombie argument,”](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2013/12/zombies- shoppers-guide.html) along with other influential arguments like Frank Jackson’s [“knowledge argument”](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2010/07/when-frank-jilted- mary.html) and [Thomas Nagel’s argument](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2012/04/reading-rosenberg- part-x.html) in his famous article “What is it Like to Be a Bat?”)",study consciousness concerned recent philosophy mind followed david chalmers distinguishing “ easy problem ” “ hard problem ” identifying neural correlate various kind conscious awareness would example easy problem characterizing problem “ easy ” chalmers mean trivial even easy every respect mean sort problem solution seems clearly attainable using existing method standard scientific philosophical assumption “ hard problem ” explaining neural process question associated conscious awareness given seems least prima facie possible could neuroscience describes complete absence consciousness alleged shown argument like “ zombie argument ” httpsedwardfeserblogspotcomzombies- shoppers-guidehtml along influential argument like frank “ knowledge argument ” httpsedwardfeserblogspotcomwhen-frank-jilted- maryhtml thomas argumenthttpsedwardfeserblogspotcomreading-rosenberg- part-xhtml famous article “ like bat ”,theist,1296,1

1750,"(Continuation)      So not just it's unfair and wrong to say that ""this usage is common to Aristotle"" but one thing that I noticed in the book of both authors is the somewhat intentional sidestep or ""shell game"" of problems - like they were trying intentionally guide the book in a way to evade potential questions to their points. To be fair, Siderits tried to address some points of that (I do recommend the reading of the Chapter 4 since the most relevant discussion of points that could be related to our philosophy concentrates there). But his position simply gives me the impression that he tries to misplace the substance into its parts (like a shell game) and then comes to the conclusion that the substance could not exist. In responding to how accidents are always found in the substances (he does not use the term accidents, I'm using it to simplify) if they do not exist, he says:      ""Consider the water atom as an allegedly indivisible substance in which inhere the qualities of color, shape, wetness and mass. Resistance to the notion that these qualities may be thought of as its parts comes from the intuition that qualities do not simply float freely in the air, that they must be tethered to something that then explains their occurrence together with other qualities. Bundle theorists are typically asked to provide the principle of qualitative unity that would explain the co- occurrence of many qualities in the absence of a substance in which they inhere. The Buddhist bundle theorist says this is the wrong question to be asking. Instead we should ask why, in the absence of empirical evidence for the existence of substances as distinct from their properties, we nonetheless have the intuition that substances are required to explain qualitative unity."" (pp. 59)      To say that ""in the absence of empirical evidence"" is just to beg the question. but he goes on to say:      ""By hypothesis, color, shape, wetness, and mass tropes are compresent at a certain spatio- temporal location. This much both sides can agree on. Here is a possible explanation of the fact that we commonly take these to all be properties of a single thing, the water atom. When we wish to specify the location of this mass trope, it is easier to indicate it by using the term “water atom” than by indicating each of the three other tropes present at that location. This makes the communication process more efficient. It also relieves us of the burden of ascertaining just which other tropes are present at that location, given that we know from past experience that mass tropes are generally accompanied by other tropes in a certain range. “Water atom” functions as a convenient designator for a certain bundle of tropes (TS 832– 34; TSP ad TS 581– 83). That they make up a bundle has as much to do with us and our interests and cognitive limitations as it does with how things are in the   world. The world as it is anyway contributes the fact of their compresence. The rest— their being unified by their joint inherence in a substance— is our doing. The Buddhist doctrine of the two truths is their answer to the bundle theorist’s problem of unification.""      Basically, he uses their conventionalist position to ""explain"" how we construe substances from things that are nothing but tropes.

Gensler finds Aquinas' ""Five Ways"" and other classical theist arguments wanting, although he doesn't elaborate much on why. A theme of the book is that there are ""many paths to God"", with one of these being science, which Gensler argues is increasingly friendly to religion (at least, the Abrahamic religions).

3065,"[17] One might think that the terminus of the chain of explanations—while not explained by any _further_ proposition—is nevertheless _self-explanatory_. I have two responses. First, I find it plausible that nothing can explain or account for why it _itself_ is true (or obtains, or exists) at all. For in order to have any explanatory power in the first place, it would ‘already’ (as it were) have to be true (obtain, exist). (‘Already’ expresses not temporal but ontological priority.) Plausibly, one cannot merely _presuppose_ the very thing for which one sought illumination. (Also, just imagine: if I ask why _q_ is true, it’s no use responding ‘because _q_ is true’. Surely, I say, this explains nothing!) But suppose I’m wrong about the impossibility of self- explanation. Suppose, in other words, that some propositions can explain their own truth. Presumably, this will involve the proposition having a kind of ‘intrinsic intelligibility’—once the proposition is grasped, there is no mystery concerning why it is true. This brings us to my second response: plausibly, _no_ explanation of persistence will be self-explanatory—in which case, each explanation of persistence will end in an unexplained primitive. And in that case, the fact that Schmid’s propositional necessity account ends in an unexplained primitive is not a mark against it as an explanation of persistence. Consider explanations of persistence that deny EIT. Such explanations either adduce one or more _atemporal_ concrete objects that sustain temporal objects or else an infinitely descending chain of more fundamental temporal concrete objects sustaining or conserving less fundamental temporal concrete objects (of which the former aren’t parts). But surely neither the proposition <there is such an atemporal concrete object> nor <there is such an infinitely descending chain> are self-explanatory.",one might think terminus chain explanations—while explained proposition—is nevertheless self-explanatory two response first find plausible nothing explain account true obtains exists order explanatory power first place would ‘ already true obtain exist ‘ already express temporal ontological priority plausibly one merely presuppose thing one sought illumination also imagine ask q true use responding ‘ q surely say explains nothing suppose wrong impossibility self- explanation suppose word proposition explain truth presumably involve proposition kind ‘ intrinsic —once proposition grasped mystery concerning true brings u second response plausibly explanation persistence self-explanatory—in case explanation persistence end unexplained primitive case fact propositional necessity account end unexplained primitive mark explanation persistence consider explanation persistence deny eit explanation either adduce one atemporal concrete object sustain temporal object else infinitely descending chain fundamental temporal concrete object sustaining conserving le fundamental temporal concrete object former part surely neither proposition atemporal concrete object infinitely descending chain self-explanatory,sceptic,1879,0
1081,"1- I don't care about what is taught by the Church, so I'll ignore that;      2- I also don't care about what Scripture teaches;      3- Aren't you getting Essence and Existence confused with Form and Matter? Knowing whether a Tasmanian tiger exists or not is a matter of knowing whether it has Existence or not, not what its Matter is. Sure, the existence of an animal might require its material exemplification, but this is not the case with immaterial beings (such as souls, angels, God, or any other candidates). What you are pointing to is precisely the difference between Essence and Existence - that you can know what-a-thing-is without knowing that-a-thing-is. It's not the same as what form a thing has versus its material cause (which also could or could not exist). I don't know what you mean by ""Pure Existence"" being vague or not infinite but Aquinas has some pretty good arguments for why Pure Existence is infinite, divine, etc.      More importantly, why are you ignoring the entire rationale for Divine Simplicity? It seems to be a recurring thing among critics. You point apparent problems but then ignore the arguments given for simplicity.      I speak as a person who has no ulterior motives; I simply am convinced that the First Cause of all things must be absolutely simple. If it had parts, then it would be dependent upon those parts for its existence, and thus would not be perfectly independent. Yet cosmological arguments require a foundation that is entirely independent of anything, which just is necessary existence, unconditioned. A composite is always conditioned by its parts, its existence is always ""iffy"" and dependent on the parts. So if ""God"" had parts, the parts would be the First Principles, not the composite. And if you follow that along, you'll reach some really bad problems.   And if God had an accident distinct of himself (his essence), where would this accident come from? It can't come from the essence lest you accept the precedence of a perfectly simple Essence which is the source of all things, which is what you're trying to avoid. But there is nowhere for the accident to come from, then, and being an accident, it cannot exist ""by its own (non- substantial, hence conditioned and dependent) nature"". You know classical authors reflected a lot on these matters and didn't just adopt Divine Simplicity because of church teaching, right?      4- And yet the same happens with libertarian freedom for us as well. Before you make your choice, there is a point in which there is no difference in your properties between world 1 (where you go on to choose X) and world 2 (where you go on to not choose X). So do you reject libertarian free will for humans too? Since I accept LFW, I already cannot accept that objection.      If I had to accept it, though, I would rather embrace necessitarian emanationism or optimism etc. than reject Simplicity, speaking for myself.      5- This objection wouldn't just cut against Divine Simplicity; it would also cut against creation being the result of a free choice, given what I said in 4. And you seem to be presupposing that an explanans must determine the explanandum, which is very doubtful (especially if it would cost us standard free will explanations);      6- Again, don't care about what Scripture says in philosophical matters (philosophy and rational argument always comes first to me) but Divine Simplicity isn't incompatible with God being personal. God *is* personal, and literally so, since he is the ultimate source of personhood. He's just eminently personal by virtue of a greater perfection (a single one) which includes the actualities of all others in a unified way.",- care taught church ignore - also care scripture teach - getting essence existence confused form matter knowing whether tasmanian tiger exists matter knowing whether existence matter sure existence animal might require material exemplification case immaterial being soul angel god candidate pointing precisely difference essence existence - know what-a-thing-is without knowing that-a-thing-is form thing versus material cause also could could exist know mean pure existence vague infinite aquinas pretty good argument pure existence infinite divine etc importantly ignoring entire rationale divine simplicity seems recurring thing among critic point apparent problem ignore argument given simplicity speak person ulterior motif simply convinced first cause thing must absolutely simple part would dependent upon part existence thus would perfectly independent yet cosmological argument require foundation entirely independent anything necessary existence unconditioned composite always conditioned part existence always iffy dependent part god part part would first principle composite follow along reach really bad problem god accident distinct essence would accident come come essence lest accept precedence perfectly simple essence source thing trying avoid nowhere accident come accident exist non- substantial hence conditioned dependent nature know classical author reflected lot matter adopt divine simplicity church teaching right - yet happens libertarian freedom u well make choice point difference property world go choose x world go choose x reject libertarian free human since accept lfw already accept objection accept though would rather embrace necessitarian emanationism optimism etc reject simplicity speaking - objection cut divine simplicity would also cut creation result free choice given said seem presupposing explanans must determine explanandum doubtful especially would cost u standard free explanation - care scripture say philosophical matter philosophy rational argument always come first divine simplicity incompatible god personal god personal literally since ultimate source personhood eminently personal virtue greater perfection single one includes actuality others unified way,theist,3680,1

1172,"@Walter      ""The main point is whether we could call a being who wants a world of suffering ""good.""      Well, we can't. I do call Him Goodness Itself and other cool names, though.      A essencial part of this christian theodicy* is that God has a relation with morality totally diferent than our own, see for instance the fact that He can judge people, can kill people, can pester people until they want to do His thing(see Jonah) etc. The Book of Job lets this clear when God finally appears, for Job is trying to tread God as a equal the whole time, who needs to explain His actions to him and all that, and when He finally appears He makes very clear that Job treatment of Him as how we would do a normal person is completely ridiculous.      So the idea that God is good yes but on a more analogical than univocal way is not a clever apologetical invention but is there on the religions of the book since the beginning. It just sounds bizarre to me to see someone argue otherwise, specially when the ""the names Scripture uses to talk of God should not be understood as exactly what they mean in us"" is a thing since the church fathers.

1457,"Hi Mister Geocon and Oktavian,      Belief in the Curse of Ham has a long Catholic pedigree. Most of the following quotations are taken from Adiele's book.      Several Church Fathers (e.g. St. Basil of Caesarea, St. John Chrysostom, St. Ambrose, St. Augustine of Hippo) all taught that the human institution of slavery had its origin in Ham's sinfulness. They did not link this to Africa. However, St. Jerome disturbingly refers to ""Ethiopians"" (Kushites) as ""black and cloaked in the filth of sin,"" adding: ""At one time we were Ethiopians in our vices and sins. How so? Because our sins had blackened us.""      Surprisingly, the first text to explicitly link the curse of Ham to Black Africans was the Babylonian Talmud, completed around 600 AD.      In the tenth century, Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria (877-940) was the first Christian Church leader to identify Black Africans as being among those afflicted by the Curse of Ham:      “Cursed be Ham, and may he be servant of his brothers...He himself and his descendants, who are the Egyptians, the Negroes, the Ethiopians, and it is said the   Barbari.”      According to the famous Christian geographical work ""Cursor Mundi"" (1300 A.D.), Noah's son Shem and his descendants were freemen who dwelt in Asia. Japhet and his descendants were nobles and knights who came to live in Europe, while ""Ham, the accursed"" and his descendants were slaves who were sent to Africa.      In the 15th century, the famous Portuguese chronicler Gomes Eannes de Azurara (1410-1474) appealed to the writings of a 12th century archbishop of Toledo, Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada (1170-1247) to support his contention that Black Africans were doomed to servitude because they were the accursed descendants of Ham:      ""The servitude of non-Muslim Moors (West Africans) resulted from the curse, which,   after the Deluge, Noah laid upon his son Ham, cursing him in this way: 'that his race   should be subject to all the other races of the world. And from his race these Blacks are descended,' as wrote the Archbishop Don Roderick of Toledo and Josephus in his Book on the Antiquities of the Jews, and Walter, with other authors who have spoken of the generations of Noah from the time of his going out of the Ark.""      In the 15th century, Dominican Friar Johannes Annius of Viterbo (1432-1502) wrote that the curse of Ham forced him into exile in Africa: “As a result of his sin, Ham is exiled to Africa.”      In the 18th century, French biblical scholar and Benedictine abbot Augustine Calmet (1672-1757) wrote in a work titled “Dictionary of the Holy Bible” (1722): “Noah assigned to Ham the nations of Africa. The occasion of the color of his sons was that Noah being one day asleep discovered his nakedness, and Ham passed that way without covering him; on which accounts his descendants are born with black complexion, and the gift of the prophecy was taken from them.”      In the 19th century, John England, the first Catholic bishop of Charleston, USA, wrote in a letter to US Secretary of State John Forsyth (1780-1841) that the enslavement of Black Africans was entirely lawful, because of the sin committed by their ancestor, Ham:      “Since every Catholic must accept Adam's fall as an essential ingredient in the human condition, he should likewise believe that it certainly was not then against the divine law for Shem and Japheth to use the services of the Black race, since their progenitor had been cursed by God for his sinful conduct.”      Finally, Pope Pius IX issued a Prayer for the Conversion of Africa through the Office of the Sacred Congregation of Rites on October 2, 1873, in which he declared: ""“Let us pray for the most wretched Ethiopians in Central Africa, that Almighty God may at length remove the curse of Cham from their hearts, and grant them the blessing to be found only in Jesus Christ, our God and Lord."" This prayer came with a 300-day indulgence.      Is it ""kind of bonkers"" to say that the Curse of Ham was a major influence on Catholic thought? I think not.",hi mister geocon oktavian belief curse ham long catholic pedigree following quotation taken book several church father eg st basil caesarea st john chrysostom st ambrose st augustine hippo taught human institution slavery origin sinfulness link africa however st jerome disturbingly refers ethiopian kushites black cloaked filth sin adding one time ethiopian vice sin sin blackened u surprisingly first text explicitly link curse ham black african babylonian talmud completed around ad tenth century patriarch eutychius alexandria - first christian church leader identify black african among afflicted curse ham “ cursed ham may servant brothershe descendant egyptian negro ethiopian said barbari ” according famous christian geographical work cursor mundi ad son shem descendant freeman dwelt asia japhet descendant noble knight came live europe ham accursed descendant slave sent africa th century famous portuguese chronicler gomes eannes de azurara - appealed writing th century archbishop toledo rodrigo jiménez de rada - support contention black african doomed servitude accursed descendant ham servitude non-muslim moor west african resulted curse deluge noah laid upon son ham cursing way race subject race world race black descended wrote archbishop roderick toledo josephus book antiquity jew walter author spoken generation noah time going ark th century dominican friar johannes annius viterbo - wrote curse ham forced exile africa “ result sin ham exiled africa ” th century french biblical scholar benedictine abbot augustine calmet - wrote work titled “ dictionary holy bible ” “ noah assigned ham nation africa occasion color son noah one day asleep discovered nakedness ham passed way without covering account descendant born black complexion gift prophecy taken ” th century john england first catholic bishop charleston usa wrote letter u secretary state john forsyth - enslavement black african entirely lawful sin committed ancestor ham “ since every catholic must accept fall essential ingredient human condition likewise believe certainly divine law shem japheth use service black race since progenitor cursed god sinful conduct ” finally pope pius ix issued prayer conversion africa office sacred congregation rite october declared “ let u pray wretched ethiopian central africa almighty god may length remove curse cham heart grant blessing found jesus christ god lord prayer came -day indulgence kind bonkers say curse ham major influence catholic thought think,theist,4040,1
2156,"@Ed Feser      So why believe Chapman over Bellarmine?      Seems the problem is the term ""heresy"" has undergone a development over the past 2000 years. The Greek term literally means to break off from the whole. In it's early use simply not following the discipline of the Church made you a heretic (where as in later times we would call you a mere schismatic). Thought in later times it is narrowly defined to refer to professing a false & formally condemned doctrinal proposition.      Allowing heresy to be taught or failing to condemn it can get you labelled a ""heretic"" even if you do not hold to any formal doctrinal or moral errors.      Also I think condemning anybody as a heretic is an act of discipline not faith and morals. I don't think the Catholic Church has the power to infallibly say Nestorius was a heretic. But she can infallibly say Nestorianism (the false view Christ is two persons, one divine and one human attributed to Nestorius) is heresy.      Which is why you can in theory rehabilitate a heretic. You don't know their subjective intent with any certainty. But you can know a given doctrinal proposition is false when the Church has clearly condemned it.

I think his second prong suggests he is using “beyond” to mean “distinct from”. For, to reach his conclusion, this internal, unrealized potency must mean something that truly is part of God, thus undermining several essential attributes.   If I’m interpreting him correctly, I can’t help but wonder, what’s the problem? It shouldn’t be that God is realizing what could be called an objective potency. I see three possibilities for how that might threaten God’s claims to divinity:   1\. It undermines his aseity   2\. It threatens his immutability   3\. It does away with his simplicity   But it’s far from clear that realizing an objective potency does any of those things. There’s no reason to suppose that making a choice involves any kind of change on the choosing agent’s part, for example.   And we can already see why divine aseity goes on unscathed. An “objective potency”, as I’ve dubbed it here, takes it for granted that the possible thing doesn’t actually exist. It’s merely a possibility, for something that isn’t self-existing. Or are we supposed to think that because God is the ultimate ground for modality, that every objective potency is just one of God’s passive potencies? Is there any reason to believe that?

Dr. Yogami offers you some help above, some of which I am going to reiterate by explaining the difference between a debate and a lecture.      At a debate you consider whether a particular proposition is true or false. A debate such as the one noted above would normally be in a form such as: whether or not materialism is true. That would be the proposition under consideration and one person would take the affirmative side (i.e. Yes, it is true) and another would take the negative side (i.e. no it is not true).      In such a debate, it is important that the terms are defined. Otherwise, equivocation can occur and the debaters will talk past one another. So, it would be important to clarify that materialism is the assertion that matter is all that there is. Once that is established and the questions are established, folks then make arguments for their positions. That is the way a debate works.      Now what you describe is a situation where you refuse to participate in the debate and stand with your hands crossed. Well, that is not a debate. That is a lecture wherein, in this instance, you sit and listen to Dr. William Lane Craig and learn from him.

3347,"In terms of expositing classical theistic and Thomistic views, there isn’t much to complain about here. My sole suggestion would be to include an analysis of _what it is to be a part_ under classical theism. Typically, for classical theists, some x is a part of substance S just in case (i) x is some positive ontological item intrinsic to S and (ii) x is distinct from S.[26] More simply (and applied to God), anything intrinsic to God is identical to God (Fakhri 2021). This understanding of parts accords well with how the Doctrine of Divine Simplicity (DDS) is traditionally articulated. As Augustine famously articulated it, God _is_ what God _has_ (Augustine, _The City of God_ , XI, 10). Similarly with Anselm: addressing God, Anselm writes in his _Proslogion_ that “you are whatever you are . . . you are the very life by which you live, the wisdom by which you are wise, the very goodness by which you are good” (2001, ch. 12). Also later in the _Proslogion_ : “[Y]ou are what you are, since whatever you are in any way or at any time, you are wholly and always that” ( _ibid_ , ch. 22). Vallicella (2019) follows suit: “God is ontologically simple . . . there is nothing intrinsic to God that is distinct from God.” Other scholars in models of God are similarly explicit about this conception of parthood in relation to DDS.[27] There are also straightforward paths from other traditional classical theistic commitments to this understanding of parthood, but we needn’t belabor that here.",term expositing classical theistic thomistic view much complain sole suggestion would include analysis part classical theism typically classical theist x part substance case x positive ontological item intrinsic ii x distinct simply applied god anything intrinsic god identical god fakhri understanding part accord well doctrine divine simplicity dd traditionally articulated augustine famously articulated god god augustine city god xi similarly anselm addressing god anselm writes proslogion “ whatever life live wisdom wise goodness good ” ch also later proslogion “ since whatever way time wholly always ” ibid ch vallicella follows suit “ god ontologically simple nothing intrinsic god distinct god ” scholar model god similarly explicit conception parthood relation dd also straightforward path traditional classical theistic commitment understanding parthood belabor,sceptic,1498,0
1592,"part 2   As far as I’m concerned, this is all mystical, pseudo-philosophical gibberish. None of these ‘explanations’ mean anything. What is an “eternal act,” or knowledge that doesn’t produce a “metaphysical change” in the knower, or something willed “from everlasting”? Yes, your idea of God is immune to most atheistic attacks, but in securing this victory, you basically hollow out the definition so much that not only is there no trace left of a loving Father we can have a personal relationship with (not such a serious problem for religions like Buddhism, but a massive blow for traditional Christianity), but ‘God,’ identified as nothing more than a string of abstract concepts, is (like all abstractions) absolutely bereft of any concrete reality independent of a thinking subject.   Third leading from my second issue is are you a Pantheist David? I have read both yours and Ed Fesers blog sites and I recall you saying “The accusation of pantheism troubles me not in the least… There are many ways in which I would proudly wear the title… I am quite happy to be accused of pantheism.”   So, unless you were being facetious, I don't see how that doesn't confirm his and his followers' beliefs about you. You've also said that ""Pantheism is a vague term."" Well, the simplest definition is God=World that's it, he is immutable, indifferent, formless and eternal. However, is it possible that the accusations of pantheism are actually misunderstood as Panentheism?   Put simply, a Panentheist (also known as also known as Monistic Monotheism), is the belief, similar to Pantheism, that the physical universe is joined to God, but stressing that God is greater than (rather than equivalent to) the universe. Thus, the one God is synonymous with the material universe and interpenetrates every part of nature (as in Pantheism), but timelessly extends beyond as well. This conception of God influenced New England Transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, and was popularized by Charles Hartshorne (1897 – 2000) in his development of process theology in the 20th Century. The Neoplatonism (which you declare yourself a follower of) of Plotinus (in which the world itself is a God) is to some extent panentheistic with polytheistic tendencies, and philosophical treatises have been written on it in the context of Hinduism for millennia (notably in the “Bhagavad Gita” and the “Shri Rudram”). For more details on Panentheism I have provided a video link below, feel free to watch it.

And if it was any doubt left between humean bundle theory and buddhist position I think this will suffice.      Siderits then brings up this purported answer to the problem of ""smuggling substance back in"": ""One might wonder whether the Buddhist reductionist is entitled to bring facts about human persons into their explanation, given that humans are themselves substances. But these substances are, they will reply, reducible to systems consisting of bundles of tropes behaving in accordance with causal laws.

But I think that their denial of universals has some relation with their momentariness thesis. And that's what I can't even understand in the first place. How can someone think that something analogous to the Heraclitean position is right in the first place? It's illogical. And someone might even say that, correctly, that the ""buddhist logic"" is very different from ""Aristotelian logic"". Fair enough.

For a while I held that God couldn't know the future because the future is not, and the act of knowing necessarily requires that which is, but fortunately some friends talked me out of that one.

This knowledge of what presently is does not necessarily preclude the rational agent from choosing to do otherwise in that moment other than what he or she was already doing, i.e. it is conditionally necessary and not absolutely necessary.

Did you not read all of what I wrote above? Christ says, ""few will find it"" (the narrow road that leads to heaven). So would you have us believe that those making no effort to find and follow the narrow path, will ultimately land themselves precisely on that path without the slightest effort? So, Christ will save them without their willing to be saved? Well, that is contrary to Catholic teaching as Trent taught definitively that we must cooperate with God's grace.      This includes following the warning of Christ to ""make every effort to enter through the narrow gate"". Your reading would require that this should be interpreted: ""You don't really need to make any effort at all because everyone will (or might) get into heave without being on the path or without trying."" Well, as I said above, that is not an ""interpretation"" it is a rejection of our Lord's words.

We’ve already canvassed some reasons (e.g., plausibly, appealing to past things to explain present things is often both legitimate and indispensable). Schmid offers (what can naturally be interpreted as) an argument from diachronic identity. In particular, Schmid is concerned with “adequately accounting for the distinction between instantaneous replacement and genuine persistence” (2021, p. 215). Schmid argues that transtemporal causal relations plausibly provide necessary conditions for adequately distinguishing “between a successive series of numerically distinct but qualitatively similar simulacra (on the one hand) and genuine persistence (on the other)” ( _ibid_ ). According to Schmid, relevant causal continuity among the stages of an object’s life—where “the later existence of the object at least partly causally or explanatorily depends on the earlier state(s) and existence of the object”—is a necessary condition and partial ground of diachronic identity ( _ibid_ ).

But this is simply untrue. First, we can give _principled reasons_ for thinking that something perfect, unlimited, and necessarily existent— _unlike_ that which is imperfect, limited, and/or contingent—is uniquely unexplained. Rasmussen (2019) argues, for instance, that limitation, contingency, and imperfection—unlike that which is unlimited, necessary, and perfect—seem to call out for deeper explanations. (Consider: plausibly, to have one’s existence owed to another is a limitation or imperfection; hence, whatever is unlimited and perfect doesn’t have its existence owed to another.) Second, such views can accept very robust versions of the principle of sufficient reason—e.g., that whatever is contingent, imperfect, or limited requires an (outside) explanation. And, importantly, there doesn’t seem to be any unique advantage accrued to someone who adopts a version of the principle of sufficient reason that whatever is such that its essence and existence are numerically distinct requires an (outside) explanation, and nor does there seem to be any reason favoring such a principle that doesn’t favor the former, neo-classical-theist-friendly principle.[5]",one might object view allows nothing virtue essence-existence composite exists suffers untoward bruteness inexplicability simply untrue first give principled reason thinking something perfect unlimited necessarily existent— unlike imperfect limited andor contingent—is uniquely unexplained rasmussen argues instance limitation contingency imperfection—unlike unlimited necessary perfect—seem call deeper explanation consider plausibly existence owed another limitation imperfection hence whatever unlimited perfect existence owed another second view accept robust version principle sufficient reason—eg whatever contingent imperfect limited requires outside explanation importantly seem unique advantage accrued someone adopts version principle sufficient reason whatever essence existence numerically distinct requires outside explanation seem reason favoring principle favor former neo-classical-theist-friendly principle,sceptic,1348,0

It is klutzy because it is just my idea. The klutziness of my idea and the subsequence describing the future are just of me and the model. They therefore do not limit God to a klutzy technique for causing this cchange. In God, the situation where 128 is prime and 127 is prime, is beautiful. And remember, this is a simulation as a computer program. It is logical because the computer is a logic machine with a logical substrate producing all the virtual simulations.      So in tomorrow's representation, when the new subsequence comes into play, whenever the question of prime or composite concerning 127 or 128 arises, the subsequence that is the virtual reality program now also runs the sub-sub- sequence that was missing in the part of the program representing times heretofore. The new stuff just adds 1 to 128 or 127, calculates whether the sum is prime or a power of 2 using the old rules, and pops out the new answer for the numbers before the addition was made.

1179,"I agree that some instances of suffering that happen in the world does indeed help us to realise and understand the goodness of God. It manifests his goodness in so far as his mercy is enough to restore even the most broken of souls and we do see examples of this. The way in which God has arranged things does give way to a lot of instances where he brings a greater good out of all the evil that is taken place, the most stark example being the crucifixion which God used to manifest his infinite mercy. Pope John Paul II as well as Thomas Aquinas have both referred to God's mercy has his greatest attribute, that attribute which displays his goodness in the greatest way since God is below no one. And to top it all it was implemented by means of an Incarnation. All these great goods would not have been possible to us in a world without sin even if an Incarnation had taken place in that world because God's mercy would have been conceivable to us only by contemplating the act of creation which would be very abstract. In this world his mercy was on its fullest display. We deserved punishment but God gave us the opposite.   Having said all that though, I think these instances serve to show us that God can indeed bring greater goods out of great evils and we can trust him in that regard. They form parts of the reason why God has permitted suffering. And it's true in a general sense. At the same time there are such ghastly acts that humans commit, that it's hard to believe that God allowed that person to suffer like that just because doesn't want that person to get attached to this world, it's even worse to propose that it was deserved as punishment. In such cases solace should be derived from the fact that even such ghastly trauma can be healed by God's mercy and at the same time refrain from attributing any reason to God for permitting it since we truly aren't in a position to know why. God himself points to our cluelessness in the book of Job.

Not because they are too counterintuitive - even though that is true - but because of the derailment of reason and the bizarre (to say the least) conclusions.      When I found Ed's blog and learned a little bit more about act and potency (keep in mind that we don't have that in Brazil, at least I never found it anywhere through my youth or academic life) there is a certain beauty in the doctrine of Aristotle - not in the sense of ""wow, after all that bullsh*t I found across the internet like reductionism and etc. there is finally something sane"" - but most especially in the way that the doctrine fits with itself i.e in the way that is constructed (the careful appreciation of every matter and etc.).

The origin of that was the fact that part of my family is ''Espirita'' (if you guys don't have that crap religion there is a mixture of cartesian res cogitans plus the movie ghost from Patrick Swayze) and for a long time I was surrounded by 'palatable' ideas like: ""after death, there is a soul in the same form as your body that will come out of it and live forever"".

You might simply think someone is wrong on some issue, and the only consequence is what you might say in order to 'correct' them. Or, someone might be engaging in behaviour that is objectively wrong, but there is nothing really you can do to stop them, or it isn't your place to stop them(many kinds of sexual behaviour, for example). That's different from situations where the person might take advantage of yourself or other people. Such as, deciding whether to lend a large amount of money to someone. If you are the only one potentially affected, you might simply allow them to take advantage of you to a certain extent(Everyone has their limits). If other people are potentially harmed, though, then it is as you describe. It would be wrong to simply let them take advantage of others, so you really have to judge on what is more likely rather than beyond reasonable doubt, because no matter what you do, there will be a 'winner' & a 'loser' in that situation.",seems term judgement depends exactly stake lot time merely opinion another huge consequence might simply think someone wrong issue consequence might say order correct someone might engaging behaviour objectively wrong nothing really stop place stop themmany kind sexual behaviour example different situation person might take advantage people deciding whether lend large amount money someone one potentially affected might simply allow take advantage certain extenteveryone limit people potentially harmed though describe would wrong simply let take advantage others really judge likely rather beyond reasonable doubt matter winner loser situation,theist,1145,1

1011,"God's act of creation is God's very essence. That's why creation is a mistery we can not fully grasp. But I think we can show that this doctrine is coherent - or, at least, we can show that the arguments against this doctrine fail.      God has but one act of will - the act by which God wills himself. And God wills everything in the act of willing himself. This Divine Act is the same in every possible world. However, just as a point can be considered as the maximal or the minimum point of different parabolas, or the zero of many different lines, God's Will can be considered as the source of different worlds. His act of Will is really the same, but virtually distinct across possible worlds.      In fact, Saint Thomas says in the Summa contra Gentiles that sometimes a causa has a non-necessary relation with its effects. During the Middle Ages, of course, he was not aware of any probabilistic events - intrinsically probabilistic, I mean, like Quantum Mechanics. But his answer has this deep insight: a cause may produce its effects, not out of necessity, but randomly or because of a free choice.      The argument against Divine Simplicity shifts, at this point, towards intentional directedness. But here I think the argument presupposes an anthropomorphic conception of Divine Choice. We do not know anything about God's psychological life. We can not affirm nor deny the possibility of choosing different things in the same Divine Act.

1706,"I'd like to discuss the Scholastic distinction between potency and act. It is often alleged that without this distinction, it is impossible to make sense of change. I'm not so sure about that.      Surely we can account for change simply by positing different levels of actuality. Thus an actual piece of gold (a substance) may acquire the higher- level (accidental) actualizations of roundness and flatness, when hammered by a goldsmith. There's no need for talk of mysterious potencies here - just different levels of actuality.      Consider also the fact that every potency, whether passive or active, is grounded in some actuality. A boxer, for instance, has the passive power to be bruised because his body is actually covered with flesh, and he has the active power to hit and knock out his opponent because his body actually contains bone and muscle, enabling him to punch hard.      Readers might ask, ""What's the difference between the account you're proposing and the Aristotelian account? And couldn't simply we define 'potency' as a lower level of actuality?"" The practical difference between the two accounts is that if every potency is grounded in some actuality, then the existence of prime matter, or pure passive potency, becomes a metaphysical impossibility. It's actuality all the way down, until we finally get to some ultimate physical forms (quantum fields, perhaps?) underlying the everyday objects we see.

""I feel it's a bit uncharitable to lay all of the blame at the feet of Pope Francis""      Who has done that? Meanwhile, Francis is the pope now, so his actions will naturally get the most attention.      I have not been criticizing Pope Francis, but ""Amoris Laetitia"" (which you mention), the Pope's communication, has prompted many criticisms of the lack of guidance from the Pope, and if these criticisms were not well founded, the plain, simply spoken guidance becomes all the more important. That people feel the absence of this is a problem. The suffering of people who feel, rightly or wrongly, that the Church is going off the rails needs urgent attention, not ""official"" statements or abstruse theology from people no one has heard of. It needs careful shepherding by the person who issued the letter - the Pope.      That its absence is no excuse for loss or destabilization of faith really says nothing. No one has excuses for their sins, and yet everyone faces attacks caused by imperfect trust in God precisely because we are human, and that is why loving pastoral guidance is needed. ""Let God sort them out, I know why their fears are unjust"" is insufficient. The absence of this guidance is fair game for criticism. The respectful waiting that you advise justifiably grows into real criticism with time. It is in a sense an abandonment of the straying sheep who need to be brought back into the fold.

Matter carries the attributes of god. It is the necessary being. It is contradictory, inconceivable, to imagine a moment when it did not exist.

In some sense, this problem is exacerbated for the positive destruction of objects in relativistic space-times.

In that case, there will exist another reference frame F’ in which the atoms comprising O do not go out of existence at the same time. Second, notice that, since the atoms comprising O will, in general, be in motion relative to each other, even if all of O’s atoms go out of existence at one time in the rest frame of one of the atoms, O’s atoms will not generally go out of existence at the same time in the rest frames of other atoms comprising O.

2022,"In support of your point, can we say that one essential factor differentiating magisterial and non-magisterial acts is the manifested will of a bishop to bind to obedience the faithful under his authority to adhere (at least in some degree) to a particular teaching?      Vatican II said of the Ordinary Magisterium, 'In matters of faith and morals, the bishops speak in the name of Christ and the faithful are to accept their teaching and adhere to it with a religious assent. This religious submission of mind and will must be shown in a special way to the authentic magisterium of the Roman Pontiff, even when he is not speaking ex cathedra; that is, it must be shown in such a way that his supreme magisterium is acknowledged with reverence, the judgments made by him are sincerely adhered to, according to his manifest mind and will. His mind and will in the matter may be known either from the character of the documents, from his frequent repetition of the same doctrine, or from his manner of speaking.' (Lumen Gentium 25)      As with Vatican I's dogma of papal infallibility, I would think that this is intended by Vatican II as a description to be also applied retrospectively, even if in the 7th century they were not yet thinking about it in these explicit terms.      The 'manifest mind' of a pope refers especially to the doctrinal content of a document; his 'manifest will' refers especially to his intention to teach and bind the faithful of the world. Normally he will not express this intention in so many words, but it can be known 'either from the character of the documents, from his frequent repetition of the same doctrine, or from his manner of speaking.'      But as a minimum, the intention to somehow bind the faithful of the world would require the intention to promulgate the teaching to the faithful of the world (not just sending a letter to one individual, leaving it to his choice and initiative to promulgate to the world as he saw fit).      The Holy See these days generally publishes a papal teaching document (including letters to individuals or groups) in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis if the pope's intention had been to promulgate that document to all the faithful - thus confirming that it has at least some level of magisterial authority.      Was it the intention of Pope Honorius that his letters to Patriarch Sergius be promulgated to the Catholic world as binding (albeit non-definitive) teaching? It does not appear so, and the condemnations of Honorius by the Ecumenical Councils do not require us to think this either.      Just as his letters do not fall within Vatican I's description of the papal Extraordinary Magisterium, neither, apparently, do they fall within Vatican II's description of the papal Ordinary Magisterium. And therefore, neither do they provide a precedent showing that a teaching of the papal Ordinary Magisterium can be not merely in error, but heretical.",support point say one essential factor differentiating magisterial non-magisterial act manifested bishop bind obedience faithful authority adhere least degree particular teaching vatican ii said ordinary magisterium matter faith moral bishop speak name christ faithful accept teaching adhere religious assent religious submission mind must shown special way authentic magisterium roman pontiff even speaking ex cathedra must shown way supreme magisterium acknowledged reverence judgment made sincerely adhered according manifest mind mind matter may known either character document frequent repetition doctrine manner speaking lumen gentium vatican dogma papal infallibility would think intended vatican ii description also applied retrospectively even th century yet thinking explicit term manifest pope refers especially doctrinal content document manifest refers especially intention teach bind faithful world normally express intention many word known either character document frequent repetition doctrine manner speaking minimum intention somehow bind faithful world would require intention promulgate teaching faithful world sending letter one individual leaving choice initiative promulgate world saw fit holy see day generally publishes papal teaching document including letter individual group acta apostolicae sedis intention promulgate document faithful - thus confirming least level magisterial authority intention pope honorius letter patriarch sergius promulgated catholic world binding albeit non-definitive teaching appear condemnation honorius ecumenical council require u think either letter fall within vatican description papal extraordinary magisterium neither apparently fall within vatican description papal ordinary magisterium therefore neither provide precedent showing teaching papal ordinary magisterium merely error heretical,theist,2927,1

So even if my winning has lower utility than your winning under similar circumstances, it does not follow that my trying to win has lower utility than my not trying to win. There are two possibilities, after all, assuming I try to win. Either I will succeed or I won't. If I won't succeed, then the harder I tried, the more enjoyable the victory for you, for your fans and for my fans. If I do succeed, the utility is lower than if I had tried and you nonetheless succeeded (I am assuming your victory has higher utility), but it may still be higher than had I failed to try (in which case very likely I would not have succeeded) because then there would have been general disappointment. So a case can be made that my trying to win is better than my not trying to win, even if other things being equal my winning is worse than your winning. And similar things seem to hold on expected utility versions.      Still, suppose that the utility of your winning is higher than of my winning, and I am about to win, but I have some subtle way of throwing the game so no one can tell, and everyone will enjoy the game pretty much as much. Then on externalist consequentialism I should throw the game in this way. Whether such a way of throwing the game is available depends on many factors: what the game is, who the audience are, what level one and one's opponent are.

Are you overwhelmed by all the publicity from your singular brilliance? Is that the reason that you don't reveal your real name? Perhaps because we would all be overcome by your rock star status as a philosopher and theologian?      Let's see what widely renowned thinkers do I know that have the initials WCB? Ah, that's right. No one. That is the reason that you are not taken seriously here (anywhere?). That is the reason that Ya'kov referred to you as a ""notorious troll."" From my limited interaction with you, that description fits the bill quite neatly.      However, there is more that can be said and Tom Cohoe has said this well, ""Ever seeing and never perceiving."" That fits the bill quite well also.      But there is no doubt some spark within you that does not want to be an obnoxious troll who is under sad delusions of grandeur. Why not try to follow that spark? Why not stop pretending that you are clever when those around you are not fooled?      Regarding St. Augustine's argument, it addresses the point that God would know the state of the world at creation. After all God knows the state of the world past, present, and future, so despite your inept assertions otherwise, this point has not eluded theologians preceding nominalism or Luther or certainly not you. So why don't you stop pretending? It isn't fooling anyone.      The suggestion that St. Augustine abandoned his account of free will later in his career is a sad trope in older reformed Protestant theology. Your repetition of this sad trope shows that you are most certainly not familiar with the secondary literature on these issues. The account of the will found in his early Cassiacum Dialogues (On the Freedom of the Will) is maintained in his anti-Pelagian writings (e.g. On Grace and Free Will). It is also maintained in his City of God. Han Luen Kantzer Komline has traced St. Augustine on the will in Augustine on the Will: A Theological Account. This work makes clear that St. Augustine did not abandon and account on the Freedom of the Will. It really only takes a cursory reading of a few of St. Augustine's early and late works to realize this. In light of this, it is clear that you are familiar with neither St. Augustine nor the secondary literature on St. Augustine. So, again, who do you think you are fooling? Why keep pretending?      I would continue to expose the nonsense in your post, but I am left to wonder whether it would do any good in encouraging you to stop being a shameless pretender. Perhaps as a sign of goodwill, you might recognize that you have no clue what you are talking about with respect to St. Augustine. Then we can move on to other things that you have no clue about.

Recall that Vallicella and Feser are here considering the possibility of an internal explanation for the unity of a thing. But their suggestions for an internal explanation of A’s being joined to B do not exhaust the possibilities as to why A is joined to B. For if the cause is internal to the composite object in question, it may be _either_ A itself, _or_ B itself, _or_ some further part C.[20] Vallicella and Feser criticize _only the third possibility_.

1754," _Even in ordinary language, the term 'proselytism' does have a vaguely negative connotation these days, so it is fair enough that the Church has chosen to deploy it to denote negative ways of promoting the faith, while giving this clarifying definition in the 2007 document.   _      Fair enough. While giving the clarification. But then again: _Not_ fair enough absent the needed clarification, and certainly not when the clarification is being more or less actively undermined by other ambiguity.      And for particulars: one specific example used, of preaching for the ""gospel of prosperity"", I would argue is **not** a sound example. The pope argues that their interpretation of the gospel is in error, and their manner of persuading is unjust. As to the latter - maybe so, although I would want to see specifics to see what, precisely, is unjust. As to their erroneous interpretation - that is so, but (in many cases, though admittedly not in all) the preachers are _sincere_ in their misguided grasp of the gospel. So their error on this is in no way more damaging to the mere fact of their trying to persuade others, than is that of mainline Protestant churches, who also are in error in their interpretation of the gospels. The pope's singling out the mainline Protestants as being ""OK"", and the gospel of prosperity preachers being mean nasty ""proselytizers"" is - on this score - not consistent.      The real problem with the BAD kind of proselytism is that it uses as persuasive forces things that _should not_ be used so. It may use false premises. Or false logic. Or appeal to emotional ""motives"" that are not founded on reasonable bases. Or unreasonable threats of bad outcomes ""if you don't convert"". But mainline Protestants have used these tools also: e.g. they have used false premises in falsely characterizing the _Catholic_ teachings from which they depart. (E.G. ""Catholics worship Mary"".)      These kinds of tools are wrongly used in _Catholic_ hands, too, so it's not the _true proposition_ on account of which they are employed that is the problem with them, it is the manner in which they act on the hearer to cause belief.      Like with all the other times Francis has played funny games with the truth: it's not that his words cannot be understood - with added clarifications - that makes them fit well with Catholic teaching overall. It's that he persistently chooses to present so many of them in obscuring, confusing, problematic ways, and he rarely bothers to clarify later himself, leaving it to other organs of the Vatican to suggest clarifications, while he goes on blythely generating more confusing commentary. The issue with ""God intends a plurality of religions"" stuff is a perfect example: he went beyond appropriate bounds in a public document, his curia ""corrected"" the sense of the passage so as to mitigate the problem, and then later he again in signing yet another public document with the same sort of obscurantist language.      Francis has publicly ""justified"" his so-called ""carelessness"" in these confusing sayings / teachings, by _saying_ that he is careless. But from the fact that the errors and obscurantism all plays to one angle, it isn't truly an accidental kind of carelessness. And anyway, if a person knows he is careless in off-the-cuff remarks, (a) that does not excuse him from _not refraining_ from making such remarks where he could sow problems, and (b) it does not excuse him with respect to written documents published after (what should be) careful consideration. Francis can easily evade charges of heresy by pointing to his carelessness.

1091,"Vincent,      You mention souls having to be branded by their bodies - nevertheless, once the soul loses the body, it CONTINUES TO EXIST. Which would be sufficient to refute the idea that existence is the same as material exemplifications. That seems obvious to me. If you wanna say things exist because they have matter, you cannot say that a disembodied soul can exist or continue to exist; at most you can say that such a soul has existed before, but no longer exists, if it no longer has matter.   Saying angels also have prime matter is okay but that'd just be another cost for a position that seems implausible and frankly doesn't seem to accomplish much.      ""As for God, His essence and existence are commonly held to be identical, anyway.""      But God is not material. So it just seems bizarre to suggest that existence comes from prime matter.      And overall, I cannot quite make sense of what you are suggesting except if we are just calling ""Existence"" ""Matter"". In that case, the form will be the Essence and Matter will be ""Existence"" and you have only a semantic difference.      The whole point of the Essence x Existence distinction, in a nutshell, is that there is a real actuality that is the ""oomph"" of things existing. When you consider a unicorn, you can understand what it is without knowing whether it actually exists or not. This is so because its existence is not the same as its essence. Sure, the unicorn's existence qua unicorn involves material exemplification, but there might be things which exist without matter (as the examples I gave), and in any case we are just trying to maintain a principle of actuality/reality here. You seem to just be turning that principle into matter. One could make more objections from the nature of prime matter and how it can be changed etc., but it's not even clear to me what you're trying to accomplish with that, and how you would avoid the arguments for a real distinction (if you really are trying to abandon it).      ""What I insist is that God's Mind or Essence has multiple thoughts and intentions which are contingent accidents - e.g. God's concept of this universe, and His intention to make it.""      But where do these accidents come from? They could only be caused by the divine essence, but then God would just be the simple essence anyway. And it seems impossible for the accidents to come about, since they would have to actualize God somehow (in the way accidents actualize the subjects), but God as pure actuality (the simple essence as you admitted) would not be able to be actualized by accidents. To put it differently: I worry that God could only cause himself parts if he already had parts in the first place (a potential to receive the actuality of the accidents/be modified by the accidents), so it would be viciously circular.   Another worry I have is that the First Cause would already prepossess in itself the actualities of the accidents it would cause, but then, what's the point? And it would be the case of a something actualizing itself, which is impossible.      ""an agent's choice to do something must be (at least logically, even if not temporally) preceded by a plan or intention to do it. ""      If intentions do not determine the choice, then it seems you are treating intentions as if they were non-determining motives or predispositions. But then the classical theist can agree that God DOES have these intentions. I certainly believe that, at least. To me, God created this universe because he was impressed by reasons R, and his being impressed by reasons R is not a contingent fact, but a necessary one. God is impressed by R in every world.      So what's the issue? Classical theists need not deny that God has intentions to act. If you accept the fact that God can create different things in different worlds without there having to be any differences in intrinsic properties in God between these worlds as he chooses what to create (something you should accept if you accept LFW) then what is the problem?

1226," _If a human on this Earth can choose a lesser good instead of a greater good, that is a imperfection._      A lamb which is killed by a lion for food is an imperfect lamb, also.      As I already indicated, the state of a man on Earth able to sin _is indeed_ less complete and less perfect than his state in heaven, when he is no longer able to sin, (though he has MORE, not less, freedom). This lesser sort of perfection may be called ""imperfection"" in one sense, or it may be called a ""more limited"" condition that is _proper to one still in this life_ : Either way, one must keep the _sense_ being used clear. Hence, one cannot employ the position that our ""being able to sin"" represents an ""imperfection"" and conclude that this contradicts Genesis saying that when God made the world, it was ""good"" because man able to sin is ""not good"". That doesn't follow. A lamb is able to die, and that's a lack of divine perfection (for God cannot die), but it's a kind of ""im""perfection that is more properly understood as a _lesser kind_ of perfection. And God intended a universe filled with beings which are imperfect compared to Him, because it is impossible for Him to have created beings that are uncreated perfection.

2141,"@ Laudator Temporis Acti,      ""It does in math""      Even in math, truth never corresponds with popularity because math depends on the logic under which it is developed and even humans can develop a logic under which what is true in one system is false under another. Under what authority do you ban the rule of inference ""(A is true implies that A is false)""? If every mathematician in the world called such a rule lunacy, that would not be sufficient to ban it. Lunacy is not even a mathematical concept.      This proffered rule of inference is perhaps the logic of some rock. Since everything is false under its logic, it wills nothing, hence does nothing of its own will. Conventionally we say a rock does not have a will.      :-)      A lunatic has a logic somewhat damaged (by convention) but still closer to normal. He can will himself (usually) to put food into his mouth and even raid the fridge, and even if his neurons are so destroyed that he can't do that, his body will digest the food under its own degraded logic. Of course he could be dying, but that is to be undergoing a change of state to something that is no longer human (lacking a will).      Mathematics just is not objective, somehow outside of creation. It is what God wants it to be. Furthermore, God is beyond our understanding. If He wants it to be possible to square a circle, he can make it so and we have only human arguments against it using the logic that God willed us to normally have, rather than another.

1663,"'Levels of actuality' just seems to be verbiage for saying 'actualities potential to actualities'. Potentiality is not some random thing that Aristotelians posit; it indicates the fact that in change things that stay the same have to be capable of things that don't stay the same. If you have that, the capability is what people are calling potentiality, regardless of what words are used for it.      Thus your real argument just seems to be a rejection of prime matter as being identified with passive potentiality. Prime matter is a conclusion arising from two lines of argument, (1) no infinite regress in material causes, and (2) something must be the subject of change in substantial change. Both of these arguments still go through on your account: there are first material causes (your 'ultimate physical forms') which remain the same in substantial change. You just are arguing that prime matter consists entirely of immaterial forms (= actualities without material causes) that are eternal and unchanging (because otherwise they would require a subject of change).",level seems verbiage saying actuality potential potentiality random thing aristotelian posit indicates fact change thing stay capable thing stay capability people calling potentiality regardless word used thus real argument seems rejection prime matter identified passive potentiality prime matter conclusion arising two line argument infinite regress material cause something must subject change substantial change argument still go account first material cause ultimate physical remain substantial change arguing prime matter consists entirely immaterial form actuality without material cause eternal unchanging otherwise would require subject change,theist,1074,1

I have also noted some of the relevant works of St. Augustine that you are not familiar with that show that he did not change his position. The work that shows this most clearly is a work written by St. Augustine at the end of his life called: The Retractions. St. Augustine knew that his writings would be maintained and widely read after his death because his fame was already so widespread during his life. He was also, like any faithful Catholic, concerned about orthodoxy and that he did not lead others into error in any way. This reflects his charity, which is why he was a saint.      In order to ensure that any mistakes in his writings did not lead others astray, he read through them at the end of his life carefully and retracted any statements that were erroneous. Such retractions are found in his work: The Retractions. This is relevant for our discussion because he revisited his early Cassiacum dialogues, including On the Freedom of the Will. And did he make the sweeping assertion that he completely rejected his early account of the will in this work? Nope. He made small and precise corrections to his cassiacum dialogues while continuing to hold to his main lines of argument within them.      St. Augustine was a clear, compelling, cogent, and precise thinker. That precision entailed that he avoided gross and unsupported generalizations of the sort that fly off your keyboard, WCB. So, no he didn't ""reject his account of the will"". That sweeping generalization has as much support as your other sweeping generalizations. That is, it has no support.

1075,"@ Walter Van den Acker,      An intelligible verbal communication can exist on a computer as a sequence of 1's and 0's that is made intelligible through an operational protocol that casts it to the monitor as readable words. No computer can print an infinite sequence to the screen, but a finite subsequence can be read through a computer this way. There is an absolute difference between an infinite sequence and a finite sequence here. Now no matter what the intelligible communication, it must exist throughout the infinite bitwise random sequence as a subsequence, normally distributed (from Wikipedia ""Normal Number"" on an infinite sequence of ""coin tosses"" : ""If a number is normal, no finite combination of digits of a given length occurs more frequently than any other combination of the same length"").      Yet in searching for the specific intelligible verbal subsequence described earlier it is impossible to know, if it is not found, that the infinite sequence is biased - is not normal, for the search could encompass a length of the infinite sequence that just does not contain the verbal subsequence. For example the sequence 01 should appear in 25% of the 2 bit subsequences, but if the sequence consisting of a million 1's in a row is where you happen to look for 01, you will not find 01 normally distributed in the million 1's. Such lengths missing the verbal subsequence must also appear in the infinite sequence, and they must also be normally distributed if the infinite sequence is normal, which it must be if it is bitwise 50/50 random.      This model of simplicity contains all human imaginable worlds that can be verbally communicated and yet no matter how much of it is human examined (i.e., the examination must be finite), a verbally communicable description of the finite world might never be found. You might just always be looking in the wrong place.      This is similarly true of human verbal speech about anything.      God knows this idea. It is a Divine Idea. As a model or image of God it does not limit God but it shows how God cannot be limited.      I should stop now for your response, your objections, questions, or additions.

Again, friends of Humean Supervenience will say that the truth conditions for counterfactuals or for laws are provided by the distribution of qualities on the fundamental arena and how that distribution covaries across possible worlds. The counterfactual question can then be answered by noting that at the closest possible worlds where O does not persist, O is positively destroyed from without. The regularity question can be answered by noting that in each of the instances where an object ceases to exist, the object was positively destroyed from without. This drives home a lesson for all law-based accounts of inertial persistence and not only those committed to Humean Supervenience: the fact that there is a specific sort of regularity concerning the persistence of objects should be explained in the same way that regularities are explained in general and the fact that objects persist unless specific conditions obtain should be explained in the way that counterfactual facts are explained in general.",friend humean supervenience either question specific collection counterfactual statement truth value eg persists could ceased exist question specific regularity eg persist unless positively destroyed without friend humean supervenience say truth condition counterfactuals law provided distribution quality fundamental arena distribution covaries across possible world counterfactual question answered noting closest possible world persist positively destroyed without regularity question answered noting instance object cease exist object positively destroyed without drive home lesson law-based account inertial persistence committed humean supervenience fact specific sort regularity concerning persistence object explained way regularity explained general fact object persist unless specific condition obtain explained way counterfactual fact explained general,sceptic,1345,0

Where then did VB get his inspiration for this position: again, as I noted above, it was influenced by Barth who had little role for cooperation with grace in his thought.

1102,"@RunDec      Given that, as I understand it, to qualify as a classical theist, a thinker has to, principally, adhere to divine simplicity, I readily concede that this is compatible with a necessitarian view, and that of many thinkers classified as such.

Davies seems to concern himself with rebutting the claim that divine simplicity entails it, and to achieve this he doesn’t need to positively prove the account he happens to think is the true classical theist account, namely, presumably that of St. Thomas. After all, it’s not like classical theism is a concrete comprehensive philosophical doctrine or “system” as opposed to a (contingently useful) classification abstracting from the all-important theoretical peculiarities.      Now, in light of your reference to pure act, I assumed that it is this account that you had in mind, and I submit that, I find, the way the pure act argument works is straightforward, really: agents act for an end, and where there is no necessary relation between the means and an end, there is no necessity. Because, on the one hand, God is pure act, something per se perfect, and is the only possible end for His acts, and creatures fail to contribute anything to His perfection, on the other, God cannot be said to will the creatures necessarily.

However, argues Aquinas, this is preferable to the outcome that would follow if we did not give others a presumption of innocence:       **He who interprets doubtful matters for the best, may happen to be deceived more often than not; yet it is better to err frequently through thinking well of a wicked man, than to err less frequently through having an evil opinion of a good man, because in the latter case an injury is inflicted, but not in the former.**_      I suggest: _On the contrary:      “Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. (Matt 5:13      …and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame. (1 Peter 3:16)      If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. (1 Peter 4:14)      No weapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every tongue that accuses you.   This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and this is their vindication from me,” declares the Lord. (Isaiah 54:17)      For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me,   speaking against me with lying tongues. (Ps. 109:2)   But thou, O God my Lord,   deal on my behalf for thy name's sake;   because thy steadfast love is good, deliver me! (Ps. 109:21)   Help me. O Lord my God!   Save me according to thy steadfast love!   Let them know that this is thy hand;   thou, O lord, hast done it!   let them curse, but do thou bless!

I don't think it is easy to establish the last statement in ""in the latter case, an injury is inflicted, but not in the former."" Let me suggest the opposite: As often as you injure an innocent man when you judge him evil, just as often so also you injure _yourself or others_ when you judge an evil man to be innocent.      To argue this: Let me distinguish: if you judge a man evil when he isn't, but you do not ACT on this opinion in any way, you do not _actually_ injure the man as such. **YOUR** thoughts don’t affect him directly, but only via some further medium. So, the only actual injury he suffers is when you ACT on that opinion. Now, perhaps the first action you might take is to declare your judgment to others and this WOULD be harm to him (in some sense or other, perhaps), but let's eliminate this: it clearly requires not your mere judgment, but your ACT to tell others. The next most likely downstream (harmful) event from that erroneous judgment is that you won't give him some trust on some matter, and this withholding from trust does actually injure him. Any actual harm requires a transfer from your _thought_ into some secondary vehicle that goes outside yourself and impinges on him. UNTIL you have an occasion (such as this withholding trust) to act on your erroneous opinion, you have not actually injured him. However, there are high prospects that there WILL be some such occasion, and so it is _very likely_ that you will injure him.

They might ENTAIL a change (A now has the property of having chosen X, say), in our case, but still this would be a consequence of the choice. If there was a requirement for a difference in properties then you could never have true indeterminism in the choice, because if it had P (and P were incompatible with the choosing of ~X, say) the cause would not be able to cause the effect that would be incompatible with the property.

1330,"""I think it would be closer to say that you completely misunderstand, since almost all of what you say is tangential, not contradictory, to what I said""      Well, it seemed to me that you had reduced relevant moral norms to customs and a ""framework of human practices and institutions"", and I strongly disagree with that. That human suffering is (ceteris paribus, to avoid soul-building considerations) something lamentable is a necessary truth, for example.      ""But you are evidently fatally deceived as to the meaning of that term, since you believe (apparently?!) that creatures ""come to possess"" these same eminent perfections when they are perfected""      They do not come to possess the same exact thing univocally (which in God would only be one perfection), but whatever they actuality come to possess must be pre-contained within God in at least the same degree or in a greater way. As such, every actuality in our ""moral agency"" must be present in God, and *not* in an inferior way. Every actuality, not every limitation. If God possessed our perfection of Intellect in a way that made him unable to know things, that would be absurd. It would be inferior. If God possessed our perfection of moral agency in such a way that he could not know moral truths (""rape is wrong"", ""human suffering is ceteris paribus bad and to be avoided"", etc) and could not act in accordance with moral truths or practical judgment, then it would be an inferior actuality. Which would be absurd.      So you are turning the discussion into something else - I never said anything that was incompatible with analogy, for instance; I was even quite explicit in saying that God's formal possession of our perfections (again, see Garrigou- Lagrange for example) does not deny analogy. And you are missing the point that if moral agency is a pure perfection (like wisdom is), then it is also proper to say God is a moral agent. Except if you wanna reject that God is wise, perhaps.      But if God did not know you existed or that you and I were having this conversation, this would certainly be a problem and he would not be ""God"" in the way that believers take him to be. And not in the sense that believers might have mistaken views of God (thinking he has real parts for instance, or is changing or whatever), but in a sense that would make most of them conclude that God would (absurdly) be seriously defective, and not worthy of worship at all.      It's not that hard, actually. If God is indifferent to (e.g.) a child being tortured to the point where he could simply not bother to do anything to stop or prevent it, when it is in his power to do so, then God would be seriously defective, unimpressive and unworthy of love and worship.      In which case he would not be God, as God is supposed to be.      But then God cannot be indifferent to that kind of stuff, i.e. prima facie, if God exists, he should be stopping or preventing these evils, unless he has morally sufficient reasons for not doing so (and then we're back to standard theodicy, skeptical theism, etc. Which us theists cannot avoid.)",think would closer say completely misunderstand since almost say tangential contradictory said well seemed reduced relevant moral norm custom framework human practice institution strongly disagree human suffering ceteris paribus avoid soul-building consideration something lamentable necessary truth example evidently fatally deceived meaning term since believe apparently creature come posse eminent perfection perfected come posse exact thing univocally god would one perfection whatever actuality come posse must pre-contained within god least degree greater way every actuality moral agency must present god inferior way every actuality every limitation god possessed perfection intellect way made unable know thing would absurd would inferior god possessed perfection moral agency way could know moral truth rape wrong human suffering ceteris paribus bad avoided etc could act accordance moral truth practical judgment would inferior actuality would absurd turning discussion something else - never said anything incompatible analogy instance even quite explicit saying formal possession perfection see garrigou- lagrange example deny analogy missing point moral agency pure perfection like wisdom also proper say god moral agent except wan na reject god wise perhaps god know existed conversation would certainly problem would god way believer take sense believer might mistaken view god thinking real part instance changing whatever sense would make conclude god would absurdly seriously defective worthy worship hard actually god indifferent eg child tortured point could simply bother anything stop prevent power god would seriously defective unimpressive unworthy love worship case would god god supposed god indifferent kind stuff ie prima facie god exists stopping preventing evil unless morally sufficient reason back standard theodicy skeptical theism etc u theist avoid,theist,3096,1

2287,"Hey, Uncommon.      If you have some time, check this (https://naturalhistory.si.edu/education/teaching-resources/life- science/early-life-earth-animal-origins). Now, this is an example of what I have been trying to say.      Leaving aside the fact that the text tried to implicitly assert the plausibility of the mitochondria theory as a 'known fact' or true without arguing - when it's in fact just a theory among others. Look what they say about animals - especially multicellular ones. And besides the fact of the 'magical' conjoining of diverse cells or microorganisms inside microorganisms, they are doing exactly as I said in the example.      As I said, this sounds insane. But based on your comments and @Tom Cohoe - and some things I read of Ed's work - I think we can say something about this. First, even though this is all true and or cells and etc. we're co-opted by 'who knows why' to work together, the history is very different now than it was long ago. Our ACTUAL existence is not like it was long ago. They say in the text that the microorganisms that formed the mitochondria were separable in principle - at least they suppose it is that way. In our actual existence, we can't separate our parts and expect them to work ALONE or in the same way, as it was long ago (again, supposing that they were right) because they are organs - parts of substances - not substances in their own right.      But one of the major problems I think that all of this has (and I'm basing myself on somewhat the same analysis that Ed does when discussing atomism in his Scholastic Metaphysics book) is when it comes to the first organism because the first organism on earth necessarily had parts that work together - and work for him. So, even if they say that our unity is an accidental one (like atomists say), they can't get rid of substance (and prime matter) in the first place (like atomists).      What do you guys think?

Alas, here are some options.

Or perhaps A is pure esse and identical to its omniscience, whereas B is pure esse and identical to its _quasi_ -omniscience (G-ness), where a being is _quasi_ -omniscient iff it knows everything an omniscient being knows _except_ for some trivial truth in some remote possible world. Or perhaps A is pure esse and identical to its own impassibility (F-ness), whereas B is pure esse and identical to its _diff_ -impassibility (G-ness), where a being is _diff_ -impassible iff its conscious state _slightly_ differs in qualitative character from an impassible being’s conscious state (which is pure, infinite bliss/joy/happiness/delight—cf.

2922,"More generally, it’s not clear that there _could_ be anything that exists in virtue of what it is, i.e., anything whose essence metaphysically explains its existence. For this thing’s essence and existence are either distinct or identical. If they’re distinct, then its essence would have to be prior to its existence in order to metaphysically explain it. But, plausibly, no essence can be prior to its existence, for then it would _already exist_ —in which case, its existence would be prior to its existence, which is absurd. By contrast, if something’s essence and existence are identical, then we would have something’s existence metaphysically explaining itself. For if it exists _in virtue of_ its essence but its existence _just is_ its essence, then it exists in virtue of its existence. Plausibly, though, this is kind of metaphysical bootstrapping is impossible. Nothing’s existence can pull itself up by its own metaphysical bootstraps; nothing’s existence can metaphysically explain _why there is that very existence_ to begin with.

1958,"""Decrying the fact that Whites are beginning to no longer be the majority in America""      I honestly haven't seen any serious conservative thinker (And I don't include the reactionary commentary of people like those at the daily wire) who has ever decried that white people are no longer going to be the majority in America.      Most sane conservative commentators decry both the excesses of the far right and the far left.      To quote a piece from one of the best natural law theorists alive on the planet today Prof J Budziszewski      ""Progressives like to say that a racist doctrine they call “replacement theory” is very big on the right.      I won’t say there is no such theory. There is. Actually, though, versions of the theory are held both on the farthest, farthest fringes of the right and – more quietly – among large, large sections of the left.      The right wing version is that immigrants, especially immigrants of color, outbreed people who were born in the country, so that descendants of the former will “replace” descendants of the latter. This is supposed to be bad.      The left wing version is that immigrants, especially immigrants of color, trend more to the left than people who were born in the country, so that leftists will “replace” conservatives. This is supposed to be good.      Both versions of the theory are nuts.      As to the former version: If the country becomes browner in a few generations, so be it. People who are too selfish to have children deserve to be “replaced” by people who love them.      As to the latter version: Immigrants who are acquainted with the politics of the country are often quite conservative; they don’t want to lose what they’ve worked and suffered to attain. So if left-wingers think immigration will lead to the “replacement” of conservatives by liberals, they may have it backwards.""      End quote      As you can see most sane right wingers don't really care if whites are a majority or not. It's not something that's bad in the first place if they lose their majority because if they aren't reproducing they deserve it.

1838,"Tony, if I understand your post, I agree with most of what you say in it. Thanks to Dr. Feser, I know what an order is in Wullner's sense of that word. But I doubt that sanctifying grace makes a non-Catholic a member of the Church.      I doubt that Pope Pius XII and Msgr. Joseph Clifford Fenton tell us the difference between being a member of the Church and being in the Church as a nonmember of it.      Pius XII and Fenton say that only Catholics are members of the Church since each member of it must meet four requirements. He must wear the baptismal mark on his soul, profess Catholicism, be willing to submit to the pope and to the Church's other legitimate hierarchy, and not be under full excommunication. By those standards, a Protestant in sanctifying grace is in the Church as a nonmember of it.      But the dogma that there's salvation in only the Catholic Church is still true because people can be in the Church as nonmembers of it.      See Mystici Corporis Christi and Msgr. Joseph Clifford Fenton's book ""The Catholic Church and Salvation.""      A non-Catholic is in the Church if there's sanctifying grace in his soul. So he'll die in her if he's in that grace when he does. But his sect doesn't get him to heaven. If he reaches it, he does that despite that sect, not because of it.      That's why Blessed Pope Pius IX writes:   ""Our Predecessor, Gregory XVI, an “insanity,”2 viz., that “liberty of conscience and worship is each man’s personal right, which ought to be legally proclaimed and asserted in every rightly constituted society; and that a right resides in the citizens to an absolute liberty, which should be restrained by no authority whether ecclesiastical or civil, whereby they may be able openly and publicly to manifest and declare any of their ideas whatever, either by word of mouth, by the press, or in any other way.” But, while they rashly affirm this, they do not think and consider that they are preaching “liberty of perdition;”3 and that “if human arguments are always allowed free room for discussion, there will never be wanting men who will dare to resist truth, and to trust in the flowing speech of human wisdom; whereas we know, from the very teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ, how carefully Christian faith and wisdom should avoid this most injurious babbling.”4""      From what you're telling me, I must have misinterpreted John Paul's quotation from Redemptor Hominis. But his Assisi meetings and Vatican II's religious liberty may make some non-Catholics likely to die outside the Church.

1446,"@Infinite Growth, there's that ignorant and vicious trope again. I'll bite, though this is a digression as my point was to show that even much more tangible claims toward restitution remain unaddressed if we wish to talk restitution.      Were there Poles who committed crimes during WWII, who went along with Nazi, or Soviet, crimes? Obviously. I feel silly even having to state the obvious because this is something that follows not from empirical fact, but from the general proposition that the moral status of the actions of individuals during wartime does not conform strictly to the divide of the front line. There were righteous Germans and righteous Russians and wicked Poles. So what? Judas betrayed Christ, but the Apostles on the whole or as a corporate body were not agents of the Sanhedrin. We can say the same about Jews who betrayed both their fellow Jews and committed crimes against gentile Poles, but we rarely talk about those, so why the special pleading here?      As a matter of empirical fact, we must remember things like:      1\. The Polish state never collaborated with the Nazis. Compare that with other European governments. This refusal to collaborate, and the formation of Europe's largest resistance, happened at enormous cost. This, in addition to Nazi crimes against the populace.   2\. Even the number of only those Poles recognized by Yad Vashem outstrips the combined number of people recognized from all other nations combined. Proportion and scale matter.   3\. The penalties for aiding Jews were uniquely and incomparably severe in Poland (involving the execution of the person aiding, his family, maybe neighbors, etc). And yet, point (2).   4\. Poland was home to something like 80% of world Jewry at the time of the war and the majority of the world's Jews for centuries. Any occurrence of antipathy (and don't forget Jewish bigotry, which did exist) at the time of the war was driven by economic, but also cultural, political, social, and historical factors, not racial hatred. That is, there was no impulse to exterminate any group and any crimes committed were isolated incidents of criminal opportunism taken during the chaos of wartime, not systematic programs of liquidation or some broad expression of national hatred. There were also incidents where Poles were forced under threat of death to participate in Nazi operations, incidents that some Jewish authors have grotesquely misrepresented either maliciously or through incompetence (e.g., Jan Gross).

2054,"@ Laudator Temporis Acti,      I am breaking down the fairly complex sentence for purposes of analysis.      ""Does not this indeterminacy within we who have not yet suffered death mean that as long as we argue about it, it can never be settled?""      Leaving out the disputed phrase this becomes, ""Does not this indeterminacy mean that it can never be settled?""      Replacing the disputed phrase, with a single word object for the preposition, this becomes, ""Does not this indeterminacy WITHIN SOME mean that it can never be settled?""      SOME = ""We who have not yet suffered death""      This is a noun clause. It is the object of the preposition ""within"". It is a dependent clause and must exist in some relation with the rest of the sentence. It cannot stand alone as an independent sentence. The preposition ""within"" connects this dependent clause with the sentence. The entire clause is the object of the preposition. Otherwise the rest of the clause, ""who have not yet suffered death"", would be standing alone with no connection to the sentence.      Let us look at the clause in isolation by making it independent.      ""We, who have not yet suffered death, pause.""      ""Us, who have not yet suffered death, pause""      You choose.      ""We pause"" or ""Us pause"" or perhaps ""Us paused"".      Only the first sounds correct to me. You choose. I will not argue it further, but I would still write it the way I did.

2753,"Why do I say P(F|CTST) << 1? Consider that for an object to persist for about 116 days is for it to persist approximately 10,000,000 seconds. And consider that there are about 1044 Planck times in one second, and hence to persist for about 116 days is to persist for about 1051 Planck times. Now, for each (possible) Plank time in an object’s life, God is free to sustain the object for that Planck time or refrain from so sustaining it, and this is true even if God has sustained the object through previous Planck times. (It’s not as though God suddenly becomes forced or compelled to continue sustaining an object, and it’s not as though some moral obligation is newly imposed on him, or whatever. These are unacceptable by the classical theist’s lights.) This entails that for a given world w in which an object persists for (at least) 116 days and is then causally destroyed by something, there are about 1051 worlds in which that object ceases to exist at some point earlier than w due to God’s withdrawal of sustenance. Moreover, under classical theism, God remains utterly invariant across all worlds, and hence there is no difference or variance on God’s end to which one could point in _any_ such world to explain why **_it_** came about as opposed to some **_other_** world. Thus, conditional on CTST, the expectation that w obtains—that is, that the single world in which the object persists for 116 days (upon which it is finally causally destroyed) obtains rather than any of the other 1051 worlds—is very small. And hence the data of F, as applied to this 116-day-lived object, is very unlikely conditional on CTST, whereas its probability is 1 conditional on EIT. And hence EIT garners very strong evidential confirmation from F vis-à- vis CTST.

1407,"Kant took the emergent sense of self of his era, and made it the seat of all knowledge. He first promulgated the belief that it is the subject (the viewer) that is central to knowledge, and not the object viewed. Socratics believed that truth was a quality that existed outside of human perception. It was a philosopher’s job to search it out. Plato, unwittingly, gave a demonstration of this in his famous parable about shadows in a cave that we have touched on. People are chained to a cave wall and can see only shadows thrown from objects passing before a fire behind them. Since this is all they ever see, they will mistake the shadows for reality. In this example, perception is not the seat of knowledge at all, but instead a false prophet. Truth does not exist in the perception of the person in the cave, but is an independent quality that is outside not only the viewer’s perception, but also outside the cave itself. Jesus took this a step further in describing truth not as a quality, but as a god, as independent from a man’s perception as it is possible to be. Truth was God, and came from God, and it was our job to accept God and His will for us. Saint Paul, foremost architect of the Christian church, anticipates Kant’s description of spiritual truth as something outside of sensory perception in I Corinthians Chapter 2: “We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, ... Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared”. In Paul’s view, we don’t get knowledge of God through our senses, but “God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.” Truth is truly outside of ourselves, and absolutely outside of our perception. It must be revealed by God. “Now we have received … the spirit which is of God; that we might know … not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth”. In this case, a viewer’s perception is useless, for truth can be known only through revelation to the spirit. Kant turned this around to teach that we cannot truly know any object outside of ourselves. All we can know is our view of that object. Thus, all knowledge is contingent on the subject, or subjective. There is no truth that we can find in an object, because we see that object only through our view. We see only our piece of it. From this point, he built a philosophical system which used scientific observation as a lens to determine what we can know, how we can know it, and how we learn it and describe it. At the same time, Kant held on to the notion that there may be truth that is outside of our ability to observe its phenomena, and so prove it. In fact, Kant felt he had proved that there were phenomena that did not have any observable traces, and so could not be known. He used the origin of matter in the universe as an example. It is here. It had to get here from somewhere, but where did it come from? Everything we can sense has an action and reaction. Everything has a start. So, what about matter? In short, Kant proved that we see things subjectively, but went on to show that this does not mean that objective truth does not exist, but only that we cannot observe objective truth, since we cannot observe the object itself. I will give you a CliffsNotes version to say that Kant built a science-based philosophy that still left room for Saint Paul’s belief that God’s truth could not come to us through our senses, but only through revelation.",kant took emergent sense self era made seat knowledge first promulgated belief subject viewer central knowledge object viewed socratics believed truth quality existed outside human perception job search plato unwittingly gave demonstration famous parable shadow cave touched people chained cave wall see shadow thrown object passing fire behind since ever see mistake shadow reality example perception seat knowledge instead false prophet truth exist perception person cave independent quality outside perception also outside cave jesus took step describing truth quality god independent perception possible truth god came god job accept god u saint paul foremost architect christian church anticipates description spiritual truth something outside sensory perception corinthian chapter “ speak wisdom god mystery even hidden wisdom eye hath seen ear heard neither entered heart man thing god hath prepared ” view get knowledge god sens “ god hath revealed unto u spirit ” truth truly outside absolutely outside perception must revealed god “ received … spirit god might know … word wisdom teacheth holy ghost teacheth ” case perception useless truth known revelation spirit kant turned around teach truly know object outside know view object thus knowledge contingent subject subjective truth find object see object view see piece point built philosophical system used scientific observation lens determine know know learn describe time kant held notion may truth outside ability observe phenomenon prove fact kant felt proved phenomenon observable trace could known used origin matter universe example get somewhere come everything sense action reaction everything start matter short kant proved see thing subjectively went show mean objective truth exist observe objective truth since observe object give cliffsnotes version say kant built science-based philosophy still left room saint belief truth could come u sens revelation,theist,3476,1

In the realm of quantity, if you are speaking of one aspect of the two referents x and y, x=y may well imply f(x) = f(y) because you have limited the context of the ""is equal"" itself. But it doesn't hold in every respect if x is not the same as y in every respect. If x is ""8"" and y is ""4 + 4"" and z is ""3 + 5"", then they are not the same in respect of ""expressed as a whole singular"" versus ""expressed as a sum of equal parts"" or ""expressed as a sum of primes""""      The = sign *does* stand for identical; the names in both sides of the sign name the same, identical thing.

I should clarify that I am *not* dismissing any criticisms of first order logic, or even saying that this way of talking is the best way of talking in every possible practical and theoretical subject. To give a simple, obvious example, as far as I know there is no good satisfactory account of intensional contexts. This way of talking entails no contradictions (or at least any obvious ones) and is especially useful in mathematics though; part of the reasons are certainly contingent and reflect the way how mathematicians are trained, but I would contend that they also reflect a deep intuition. Mathematical objects are simple in the sense that their identity conditions are sharp and clearly delineated -- they are the furthest removed from the material. Virtually all of mathematics can be formalized in ZFC, possibly with some extra large cardinal axioms; *equality* itself can be defined in terms of the other primitives (in symbols: x = y iff forall z, z e x <=> z e y). In this setting, we have: (1) *everything* is a set and (2) *everything* can be constructed bottom up from the empty set via (possibly transfinite) iteration. This is a large amount of reduction and simplification, yielding a powerful framework. But to circle back to the criticisms, it also has its downsides. Now suddenly, it make senses to ask the non-sensical question if the number 5 is an element of the number 1023.

1529,"Quoting Hart:    _For God, deliberative liberty – any “could have been otherwise,” any arbitrary decision among opposed possibilities – would be an impossible defect of his freedom._   And:    _A God who merely chooses to create – as one equally possible exercise of deliberative will among others – is either actualizing a potential beyond his nature... or he is actualizing some otherwise unrealized potential within himself...._      I notice that Hart is essentially stating the Modal Collapse objection in these passages, which purports to find a dilemma according to which either creation must be as actual as God Himself, or His act of creation must be utterly arbitrary, random, and unintended on His part.      Rather than rejecting this dilemma as classical theists do, or taking it as an argument against the Unmoved Mover as atheistic proponents of the argument do, Hart affirms the first leg of the dilemma, collapsing creation into necessity and thus crossing into pantheism. He wants to arbitrarily take this only halfway, though, rather than following that line of logic to its full implication that change and multiplicity are illusions, and only Being Itself exists, a la Parmenides.      As Ed points out, to assume that creation must be as necessary as God in order to be caused by God ignores the distinction between active potency and passive potency. And that distinction isn't some special pleading, but rather a direct implication of the Unmoved Mover argument.      I would argue that the idea that creation must be either necessary or random also evinces a tendency especially common among moderns to try to collapse free will (the choices of rational agents with will and intellect) into either blind law-like automation or random chance, the two broad categories of mindless, mechanistic causation allowed by the ""scientific"" reductionist- mechanistic worldview. _Even though we experience it all the time in our own choices_ , they simply have a difficult time understanding that a free rational agent can cause things such that they are not necessitated by the agent's nature but are still grounded in it and non-random, and that this does not reduce to something less.",quoting hart god deliberative liberty – “ could otherwise ” arbitrary decision among opposed possibility – would impossible defect freedom god merely chooses create – one equally possible exercise deliberative among others – either actualizing potential beyond nature actualizing otherwise unrealized potential within notice hart essentially stating modal collapse objection passage purport find dilemma according either creation must actual god act creation must utterly arbitrary random unintended part rather rejecting dilemma classical theist taking argument unmoved mover atheistic proponent argument hart affirms first leg dilemma collapsing creation necessity thus crossing pantheism want arbitrarily take halfway though rather following line logic full implication change multiplicity illusion exists la parmenides ed point assume creation must necessary god order caused god ignores distinction active potency passive potency distinction special pleading rather direct implication unmoved mover argument would argue idea creation must either necessary random also evinces tendency especially common among modern try collapse free choice rational agent intellect either blind law-like automation random chance two broad category mindless mechanistic causation allowed scientific reductionist- mechanistic worldview even though experience time choice simply difficult time understanding free rational agent cause thing necessitated nature still grounded non-random reduce something le,theist,2200,1
2765,"I have several responses. First, few (if any) of the metaphysical accounts of EIT developed in Section 5 treat inertial persistence as a property or power of substances. We saw that tendency-disposition accounts can be cast in metaphysically lightweight terms that commit to the existence of neither a property nor power corresponding to inertial persistence. In fact, Beaudoin’s tendency-disposition account merely cited the _absence_ of a tendency to expire in conjunction with the non-exercise of potentially destructive powers. Similarly, transtemporal accounts like the Transtemporal Explanans adduced earlier do not postulate a property or power of a substance that explains its persistence. Instead, what explains persistence is transtemporal explanatory (e.g., causal) connections that relate the successive phases of objects’ lives. Law-based accounts cite laws of nature, and many such accounts do not treat laws as properties or powers of substances. Clearly neither objectual nor propositional necessity accounts treat inertial persistence as a property or power of substances. Finally, no-change accounts like the No-Change Explanans adduced earlier make no appeal to properties or powers of substances.

It would follow that Socrates’ singleton set cannot exist without Socrates existing (cf. Baddorf (2016, p. 410)). Hence, there’s a logical dependence in both directions.

1919,"Suck up all the words you want, when you can, while you can, Tom Cohoe. Because, as history is demonstrably informing us the hegemony of Catholic thought will continue to downsize in the public square due to its ever- decreasing significance and relevance in addressing the existential challenges in contemporary society. People are shedding the skin of catholic thought, not because it is wrong, but because it does not represent a comprehensive, let alone a universally acknowledged course in navigating the complex nature of modern life and its eclectic demands. It's a wishful throw-back to the 'good- old' days, to simpler times.      All of Feser's bogeymen, the most feared catholic demons are there: Marxism, postmodernism, liberation theology, and CRT. And Feser's manufactured rendition of CRT is intellectually and philosophically mistaken. Just as the extremely lucky that have had the good fortune of overcoming the psychological ravages and effects of Stockholm syndrome can attest, how easy it is for Catholics on this site to play the 'victimhood' card, that white people are being.

While-ever proponents such as Dr Feser deliberately choose to link Catholic thought as synonymous to the wholesale debasement of CRT going forward, my work is easy. I have no need to effect anything that isn't already the ineluctable result of the shrivelling of catholic thought. The seeds of its own destruction are deeply embedded within its own character.   It is egregiously misplaced for Dr Feser to argue from a perspective that is entirely unfounded. CRT does not, I repeat, does not teach that any race is inherently racist or superior, but it does teach how race is deeply ingrained in our history. The dozen or so States that have legislated against the 'teaching of CRT' in schools, banning books and curricular material across the country is the stuff of authoritarianism, not of democracies. It is nothing less than a cynical and forlorn attempt not only at erasing a somewhat sorry chapter in human relations but equally, the wholesale whitewashing of American history.

3304,"Here is the first false claim that I make. According to Feser, I claim that classical theism says that God does not have properties. Feser says that this is not an accurate portrayal of classical theism (p. 3). I find this really wild since I have repeatedly quoted Katherin Rogers explicitly saying that God does not have properties. In case you don’t believe me, let me provide the quote in full. Rogers writes, “The medieval view, spelled out most clearly by Aquinas, but certainly there in Anselm, is that, strictly speaking God neither _has properties_ nor _is_ He a property…however unified and exalted.

But this won’t work, for the reasons articulated by Merricks (2019, pp. 600-601). In short, if ‘∃’ expresses the disjunction ‘∃a or ∃p’, then ‘~∃x(~Fx)’ expresses ‘~(∃ax(~F) or ∃px(~F))’ , which is equivalent to ‘~∃ax(~F) and ~∃px(~F)’, which in turn—given interdefinability—is equivalent to ‘∀ax(Fx) and ∀px(Fx)’. And since ‘~∃x(~Fx)’ is equivalent to ‘∀x(Fx)’, it would follow that ‘∀’ would express ‘∀a and ∀p’.

As we saw earlier, vicious explanatory circularity entails that x causes or grounds y while y causes or grounds x. This is impossible regardless of whether there is some z that accounts for both x and y, since the very fact of the vicious circularity entails that x is both prior and posterior to y, which is a contradiction. If hylemorphism entails that two distinct things are viciously intertwined—such that the existence of each explains the existence of the other—then that would simply be a _reductio_ of hylemorphism. Far from demonstrating the need of an extrinsic sustaining cause for any composite object, Feser’s step four imputes a metaphysical impossibility to composite objects _from the get-go_. And if Feser holds instead that x only causes or explains y in some respect distinct from the respect in which y causes or explains x (in order to avoid contradiction), then his argument no longer has teeth.

2144,"Dr. Feser, respectfully, you make a clear error here. The council being wrong about Honorious being a heretic would be an error in a judgment of historical fact, not a matter of faith and morals. The matter of faith and morals would be the judgment of monothelitism as heresy, which is entirely true and accurate; whether or not Honorious was a heretic is a matter of historical fact and judgment, and the Council is not and never has been stated to be protected on questions of that kind. You claim that judging Honorious to be a heretic is a matter of faith and morals, but this is wrong; the matter of faith and morals is the condemnation of the *teaching* as heresy. If a judgment of an individual as a heretic was protected infallibly, excommunications could not be lifted years after someone's death, yet this happens all the time.      If Honorious was using his authority as the Pope to teach - and I disagree that writing anything in a private letter rises to such authority, as when the Pope attempts to teach something to the universal church he addresses the Church directly - then Honorious cannot teach heresy. The reason is that we are obliged to give religious assent of will to anything a Pope teaches from the ordinary magisterium, and the Magisterium cannot bind us to sin.      Honorious was *possibly* a heretic by the standards the Councils were using at the time but absolutely *not* a heretic by the standards we use to judge heresy today, as monothelitism had not yet been definitively judged as false by the Church. If we were to call him a heretic in the way that Vatican I understands the term, we'd also have to call St. Thomas Aquinas a heretic for rejecting the Immaculate Conception.

To be even more precise, there is a very strong _presumption_ in favor of such assent, though the Church, in documents like _Donum Veritatis_ , has acknowledged that there can be rare cases in which this presumption is overridden and a faithful Catholic at liberty respectfully to raise questions about some magisterial statement.

To be unbiased, the infinite sequence would have to contain, as a subsequence, the choice to turn away from God (exit paradise). If the infinite sequence did not contain the choice as a subsequence, the infinite sequence would not be an unbiased random sequence and it would not be simple but would be complex.

Thus, it is impossible for Sophia, a human, to lose the feature ‘being a living organism’ _while remaining in existence_. But this doesn’t entail that it’s impossible for Sophia ‘lose’ this feature (in the sense that it is no longer true that Sophia has this feature), since Sophia can ‘lose’ the feature (in the aforementioned sense) by _going out of existence_. In such a case, it is no longer true that ‘Sophia is a living organism’, whereas it was true earlier.

2970,"Merricks proceeds through different ways of modifying, supplementing, or replacing (26) in order to state pluralism. But none of them, argues Merricks, succeed. For instance, one might add to (26) the claim that something a-exists and something p-exists. But this modification still fails to state act-potency pluralism, since a pluralist who accepts a-exisence, p-existence, _and another_ particular form of existence—someone we might call an act-potency- plus pluralist—also accepts the modified thesis. Hence, someone who denies act-potency pluralism would accept the modified thesis, in which case it fails to state pluralism. Alternatively, one might add to (26) that there are exactly two ways of being. But stating that there are exactly two ways of being ultimately requires a truly universal quantification: there is _this_ way of being, that _other_ way of being, _and these are all the ways of being there are_.

Benocci appeals to dispositions, which “consist in displaying a certain kind of manifestation under a certain kind of condition or stimulus” (2018, p. 60).

1020,"God can have all the necessary reasons to create in every possible world. And he knows these reasons by knowing himself.      If your problem is that you think these reasons have to be literal, existing separate things in the divine mind (and they cannot be identified with each other) then the problem isn't with divine creative freedom per se, but rather with the status of the multiplicity of divine ideas (""and 2 must be different from 5!""). That is a different problem. Speaking for myself it's not clear to me that divine ideas must literally exist as separate entities; the nature of knowledge and how (it seems to me) it's basically a ""transparent"" power whereby something is grasped by the knower and understood through itself seems to me compatible with God knowing different abstract facts by means of a single known concrete substance which is analyzed (a substance that happens to be the ground of all possibilia anyway, God), though I cannot hope to imagine it. I think what Dolezal has written on the divine ideas would also be very helpful here.      Thus God's personhood is grounded in impersonal notions like ""being"" and ""act"": for Thomists, these are what God is, primarily""      This misses the point. The point at that stage is precisely that ""being"" and ""act"" are NOT impersonal. Intelligence is an irreducible aspect of existence which some beings (like us) enjoy when they're not limited enough. God's personhood is not grounded in anything impersonal (that would be absurd); existence in its fullness is taken to be irreducibly personal. It's impersonal beings that just happen to be limited enough that they are unable to possess that dimension of being, so to speak.

2237,"Obviously, one can go too far. A virtue is a mean between extremes, and just as one can be too _quick_ to attribute evil to others, so too can one be too _slow_ to do so. Aquinas does not say that we should _never_ judge another to have a bad motive. He says that we should not do so _if_ we lack sufficient evidence to make a certain judgment about the matter, _if_ our judgment tends to be clouded by dislike of the person, and so on. But with some people, it is possible dispassionately and objectively to judge from their patterns of behavior over time that they are indeed acting from bad motives. There is no sin in making such a judgment under such circumstances. On the contrary, a habitual refusal to do so can be a vice. As [I have discussed elsewhere](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2019/11/against-candy-ass- christianity.html), Aquinas argues that just as one can sin by being excessively angry or insufficiently affable or friendly, so too can one sin by being _insufficiently_ angry and _excessively_ affable in the face of grave evil. Dogmatic non-judgmentalism would be a similar moral failing. It is not Christ’s teaching, but a distortion of that teaching.",obviously one go far virtue mean extreme one quick attribute evil others one slow aquinas say never judge another bad motive say lack sufficient evidence make certain judgment matter judgment tends clouded dislike person people possible dispassionately objectively judge pattern behavior time indeed acting bad motif sin making judgment circumstance contrary habitual refusal vice discussed elsewherehttpsedwardfeserblogspotcomagainst-candy-ass- christianityhtml aquinas argues one sin excessively angry insufficiently affable friendly one sin insufficiently angry excessively affable face grave evil dogmatic non-judgmentalism would similar moral failing teaching distortion teaching,theist,1177,1
1090,"Finally, Davies emphasizes that “to speak of God as simple is not to attribute a property to God but to deny certain things when it comes to God” (p. 179). Here, as he has in other work, Davies emphasizes the idea that the ascription of attributes to God should be understood as an exercise in _negative_ or _apophatic_ theology. The main arguments for classical theism, he points out, emphasize both that the world is contingent or conditioned in various respects, and that an ultimate explanation of the world must be _un_ conditioned and _non_ -contingent in those respects. (Though, just in case he wouldn’t himself use it, I should note that the language of “conditioned” and “unconditioned” in this context is mine, not Davies’.) In particular, God must _not_ be changeable, must _not_ have properties that are distinct from each other or from him, and so on. This is what it means to characterize him as simple. But by the same token, he must _not_ be compelled to create by anything either internal to his nature or outside of him.

1898,"Tadeo,      This is a great question that has been considered by great theologians like St. Augustine. The answer lies partly in God's relationship to time. God does not learn things that occur in history. He sees them all in one glance because he is outside time. He is not bound by it, but he is the cause of the existence of all that is bound by time. So in one glance He sees all things and He sees all things in relation to Himself. This pertains to Aristotle's thought thinking self. God knows all things as being caused by Himself. He sees in Himself the cause of all things and sees all things as caused by Him. This entails that all things (such as our prayers) can only be known in the full sense with reference to God who is the cause of our existence while praying and the cause of the very beings about which are prayers are concerned (e.g. our children or parents or friends, etc). This pertains also to His Will because, in seeing all things at once, He does not will things in acts that are temporally distinguished. In the unity of the Divine Will flowing out of the unity of Divine knowledge of all things created, all created things are willed by Him. This unity of the Divine will in the act of creation is an act of Divine Goodness. It is a sharing of HIs goodness with the created order. This is a Trinitarian act because Christ is the Word of God through whom He speaks the world into existence and the Spirit is the love of the Divine Will by which He wills the world from His Goodness. I would like to add more, but cannot due to time, but perhaps later I can do so.",tadeo great question considered great theologian like st augustine answer lie partly relationship time god learn thing occur history see one glance outside time bound cause existence bound time one glance see thing see thing relation pertains thought thinking self god know thing caused see cause thing see thing caused entail thing prayer known full sense reference god cause existence praying cause being prayer concerned eg child parent friend etc pertains also seeing thing thing act temporally distinguished unity divine flowing unity divine knowledge thing created created thing willed unity divine act creation act divine goodness sharing goodness created order trinitarian act christ word god speaks world existence spirit love divine will world goodness would like add due time perhaps later,theist,1591,1

Creation is eternally happening. Caused by God. See Augustine's ""Confessions - Book XI"". Augustine never took all of this to its logical ends.. He never realized his claim that God did not cause our actions good or bad was logically and rationally wrong.      Augustine had some large conceptual blind spots. Which is theology's basic problem. Of course any theologian who realized this sort of problem confirmed classical theology was nonsense dared not admit it in writing publically.

Jean Messlier was an example of a well respected priest who scorching opinions were only known posthumously.      Did Augustine abandon free will? Yes. Read the Council of Orange. Which followed Augustine until that turned out to be problematic.      Later, insisting free will was impossible as Augustine suggested became heresy. A monk, Gottshalk of Orbis, who insisted on Augustine's abandoment of free will was censuted and spent 20 years in prison, refusing to abandon that opinion. The Synod of Paris in the tenth century, pronounced that opinion heresy, utterly abandoning the Council Of Orange. Manuscripts about the Gottshalk affair only recently have been gathered and translated. I do not know if these have yet been published.      You might want to read the Council of Orange.

1246,"David,      ""And it is absurd to bring to bear the (your) standards of human moral agency to attempt to critique what (little) you understand to be God's exercise of his moral agency.""      I think I can very much make a good analogy here. And my point is I believe I know some necessary moral facts which allow me to say what God can or cannot do (will or will not do). For instance, I am totally confident that it is impossible for God to create a universe consisting of nothing but children being burnt, tortured in horrible pain until they die and are annihilated - they don't even go to heaven eventually, nothing. I am confident that God cannot do that because it would be immoral.   So I can use my knowledge of morality to know what God can or cannot do. Of course, my knowledge will be limited and I could be mistaken about some things, but that goes for anything and it doesn't mean I can't draw rational conclusions here. And of some things I am very confident.      ""(what with ""ceteris paribus""* and all that -- wink wink) it's really not?""      The ceteris paribus clause is there just because I am open to human suffering possibly serving a greater good through e.g. soul-building theodicies, ""becoming stronger/virtuous through pain"", whatever. But the ceteris paribus version of the proposition is still true, and so human suffering is something that God should seek to alleviate/prevent, unless there is a stronger reason why he can't/shouldn't (and that is when we are led to theodicy).      ""But in any case, so what? What are you alleging against the Almighty here? That you're having trouble shaking the suspicion that you might have a better grasp of Necessary Moral Truths than he does?""      No? The point is that if God exists, he cannot fall short of the standards of necessary moral truths as I was talking about. (Indeed, for me he would be the Good itself, and the Good obviously cannot fall short of those moral facts; rather they are supposed to be reflections of the Good, which is only more reason to expect more of him than us, not less). And this sets up the problem of evil, because clearly the world is prima facie a pretty crappy place.      ""It's not that hard, actually. If God is indifferent to (e.g.) a child being tortured... (etc.)""      ""So again, back to the classic question: ""What if God was one of us,""      What if God is truly and perfectly good and wise.      ""But as you yourself say: ""In which case he would not be God, as God is supposed to be."" -- Right, but...""      Yeah, but the point is that the problem of evil is a challenge to God's existence. And it cannot be solved by holding that God, ""not a moral agent"", could really just be indifferent to horrible evils and do nothing about them, and so the existence of horrible evils ""could not possibly be incompatible with him"". This solution doesn't work unless one is okay with (absurdly) turning God into a seriously defective, irrational being, unworthy of worship (because this is what it would be entailed by it for most people, myself included). So the Davies line adds nothing to the problem; at the end of the day, we need the standard responses (skeptical theism, theodicies, etc.). Those responses come with an epistemic cost, but the theist must deal with that.

2086,"Well if you just take a quick online survey of all the orthodox catholic philosophers/academics (Dr Matthew Levering, Dr Chris Kaczor, Dr Scott Hahn , Dr Michael Patrick Barber, Dr Jennifer Frey, Dr Robert P George etc) and analyse their public statements , you would probably find that Prof Feser has been the most critical and open about his reservations with regards to this papacy.      As for negativity, the very reason why there has been an increase of posts on these topics is that, Prof.Feser thinks that Pope Francis is close to committing heresy, hence the urgency to show that it is possible for a Pope to commit heresy so that it isn't seen as some kind of novelty, which is kind of a bleak or negative outlook don't ya think ?      I mean instead of preparing for the worst, might it not be better to pray for the best, to pray that such a scenario doesn't arise in the first place, to pray that the Holy Spirit grant Pope Francis sound wisdom.

Second, the exact same reasoning Hsiao and Sanders employ against existence’s being a property or a non-essential feature of S equally applies to their claim that existence is an activity of S. For in order for S to _act_ in a given way—to perform some activity like walking, say—S must _already_ exist. Something must first _exist_ in order to engage in various activities (i.e., in order to act, in order to have activity). Non-existent things, after all, surely don’t act or engage in activities. Thus, existence cannot be an activity of S.

2935,"In any case, my to-be-articulated argument (which simply expounds on the argument in Merricks 2019) doesn’t rest on a quantificational model of existence criticized by pluralists like Vallicella (1983; 2014) and Miller (1992), and nor does it rest on what Kerr (2015, p. 68) calls the Frege- Russell-Quine view of existence. As Merricks (2019) points out, the argument can be run _both_ in terms that employ quantifiers _and_ in terms that don’t. For nearly every argument Merricks gives in his article, there is a formalized, quantificational version but also a version that makes no reference at all to quantifiers. The quantificational apparatus of first-order logic, then, is _not_ after all essential to Merricks’s argument—we need not assume that the quantifiers alone offer an adequate semantics of “exists.” As Merricks writes, the concern of his argument is _metaphysical_ rather than semantic or logical: “For the debate at the heart of this paper is not primarily about such symbols. Rather, that debate is about whether everything enjoys the same way of being, or instead enjoys one or another of two ways of being, or one or another of three, etc.” (2019, p. 593). What’s more, where we _do_ use quantifiers, our usage thereof _only_ assumes that quantification _accurately represents_ existence. Our usage assumes _none_ of the following: that quantification _fully_ represents existence; that quantification captures _everything_ that needs to be captured in analyzing existence; that quantification _explains_ similarity or difference in ways of being; that existence is (or ought to be) _analyzed in terms of_ quantification; that existence or being _just is_ (or _just means_ ) quantification or being the value of a bound variable (as Quine 1948 put it) — e.g., if existence is (primarily) a first-order property, then quantification over objects may very well _accurately track_ just those objects that enjoy existence as a first- order property; that existence is not a property things have (or that existence is a second-order property); that existence is reducible to or synonymous with instantiation; and so on. In short, even if quantification elides important facts about existence, this is entirely compatible with quantification _accurately representing_ existence, just as scientific abstraction—while eliding important features of the modeled phenomena—can nevertheless accurately represent said phenomena. (Thus, _assuming_ (as we (and Merricks) argue we shouldn’t) that the to-be-articulated argument is essentially tied to quantification, one way to circumvent the argument is to affirm that quantification _doesn’t_ accurately represent existence. But, first, the argument is still significant for those who affirm as much, since the argument would then establish the philosophically significant _conditional_ claim that _if_ quantification accurately represents existence, _then_ the Aristotelian proof assumes the problematic thesis of ontological pluralism. Second, if the proponent of the Aristotelian proof (or ontological pluralism) wishes to take this line of response, they owe us some way to accurately represent existence. (And if no such way is forthcoming, this is plausibly a mark against their view vis-à-vis views that _are_ able to accurately represent existence.) Third, it’s at least worth noting that quantifier expressions offer a very natural way to represent the _being_ of entities (while predicates offer a very natural way to represent the _nature_ or _character_ of entities).)",case to-be-articulated argument simply expounds argument merricks rest quantificational model existence criticized pluralist like vallicella miller rest kerr p call frege- russell-quine view existence merricks point argument run term employ quantifier term nearly every argument merricks give article formalized quantificational version also version make reference quantifier quantificational apparatus first-order logic essential argument—we need assume quantifier alone offer adequate semantics “ exists ” merricks writes concern argument metaphysical rather semantic logical “ debate heart paper primarily symbol rather debate whether everything enjoys way instead enjoys one another two way one another three etc ” p use quantifier usage thereof assumes quantification accurately represents existence usage assumes none following quantification fully represents existence quantification capture everything need captured analyzing existence quantification explains similarity difference way existence ought analyzed term quantification existence mean quantification value bound variable quine put — eg existence primarily first-order property quantification object may well accurately track object enjoy existence first- order property existence property thing existence second-order property existence reducible synonymous instantiation short even quantification elides important fact existence entirely compatible quantification accurately representing existence scientific abstraction—while eliding important feature modeled phenomena—can nevertheless accurately represent said phenomenon thus assuming merricks argue to-be-articulated argument essentially tied quantification one way circumvent argument affirm quantification accurately represent existence first argument still significant affirm much since argument would establish philosophically significant conditional claim quantification accurately represents existence aristotelian proof assumes problematic thesis ontological pluralism second proponent aristotelian proof ontological pluralism wish take line response owe u way accurately represent existence way forthcoming plausibly mark view vis-à-vis view able accurately represent existence third least worth noting quantifier expression offer natural way represent entity predicate offer natural way represent nature character entity,sceptic,3537,0
2683,"Naturally, debates concerning divine aseity overlap quite heavily with the considerations adduced above. According to divine aseity, God is “an absolutely independent being—a being that does not depend on anything else for its existence” (Fowler 2015, p. 115). One of the principal motivations for DDS derives from aseity. If there were some item intrinsic to but distinct from God—that is, if God had some part—then God would be dependent on something that is distinct from God. As Aquinas writes, “every composite is posterior to its component parts, and is dependent on them; but God is the first being” ( _Summa Theologiae_ I, q3 a7). One influential response to this line of reasoning derives from what Fowler calls the _Doctrine of Divine Priority (DDP)_ : “For all x, if x is a proper part of God or x is a property of God, then x depends on God for its existence” (2015, p. 122). And since dependence is asymmetric, God does not depend on God’s parts. Like Baddorf, then, Fowler offers whole-to-part grounding as a viable model for understanding divine aseity and the independence of at least one whole.",naturally debate concerning divine aseity overlap quite heavily consideration adduced according divine aseity god “ absolutely independent being—a depend anything else existence ” fowler p one principal motivation dd derives aseity item intrinsic distinct god—that god part—then god would dependent something distinct god aquinas writes “ every composite posterior component part dependent god first ” summa theologiae q one influential response line reasoning derives fowler call doctrine divine priority ddp “ x x proper part god x property god x depends god existence ” p since dependence asymmetric god depend part like baddorf fowler offer whole-to-part grounding viable model understanding divine aseity independence least one whole,sceptic,1111,0

2069,"I am glad we agree on the subject of heresy, and retract my comment that you were incorrect on that point.      But your point about the Council still does not stand. They were in fact making a *historical* claim in judging Honorius guilty of heresy. Councils can be incorrect about historical claims. You say this:       _First, the reason a council condemns someone as a heretic is because of his teaching. Hence it is, first and foremost, Honorius’s teaching that was condemned. That means that the teaching was judged heretical. But whether a teaching is heretical is a doctrinal matter, and not a mere historical matter. Now, given that a papally-approved council cannot err on doctrinal matters, it follows that the councils in question infallibly judged that Honorius’s teaching was heretical (whatever his intentions). But since anyone who teaches heresy is a heretic, it follows (at least given that Honorius really did write the letters that got him into trouble, as most of his defenders concede) that these councils did after all infallibly judge that Honorius was a heretic._      This does not follow. The councils judged that *monotheilitism was a heresy*, which is completely true. They then made the historical claim that *Honorius was a heretic*, which is not protected by any infallible charism whatsoever. The key point protected by infallibility is not that Honorius was a heretic; it's that monothelitism is a heresy. Whether or not Honorius actually taught monthelitism cannot be established merely by the council's say-so. That simply is not a doctrinal claim.      You then say this:       _Second, the reason most of Honorius’s defenders try to defend him is to avoid having to acknowledge that a pope can teach heresy when not speaking ex cathedra. Now, suppose that the councils did indeed get it wrong when judging that Honorius, specifically, was a heretic. Since that is a historical rather than doctrinal matter, such an error is possible. Still, by making this judgment, the councils also taught by implication that it is possible for a pope to teach heresy (when not speaking ex cathedra). And that is a doctrinal matter. That is enough to refute the larger claim that Honorius’s defenders are trying to uphold by defending him._      A Pope can speak heresy, potentially; a Pope cannot teach heresy in the capacity of utilizing his magisterial authority to bind the faithful to religious assent of will, because then the Magisterium would be leading the faithful off the path of salvation. And as you happily acknowledge, what the councils were condemning as heresy is not the understanding that Vatican I used and is in fact not sinful, because monothelitism had yet to be condemned directly in a Church council or by an authoritative papal teaching.      Also, I am supremely unconvinced that a private letter can ever be an act of Magisterial teaching in any case, and not simply the private opinion of the man who happened to be Pope.      Also you say this:       _Wright neglects to mention the opinion of St. Francis de Sales, who, when addressing papal authority in The Catholic Controversy, says that “we do not say that the Pope cannot err in his private opinions, as did John XXII, or be altogether a heretic, as perhaps Honorius was” (p. 225)._      Wright ""neglected to mention"" him because St. Francis De Sales is clearly not condemning Honorius, merely mentioning in passing that he PERHAPS was a heretic.

1040,"Hi Ed,      I respectfully put it to you that the Thomistic doctrine of Divine simplicity you're defending here has passed its use-by date, for the following reasons:      1\. It isn't taught by the Church, which merely affirms that God has “one essence, substance, or nature absolutely simple” (Lateran IV, 1215). There's nothing here about whether God has contingent thoughts, plans or intentions in his capacity as Creator of the cosmos, in addition to possessing a nature which is necessary.      2\. It's totally unscriptural. The Bible depicts God as explicitly declaring, ""My thoughts [plural] are not your thoughts"" (Isaiah 55:8), in a verse affirming Divine transcendence (which is the last place where one would expect anthropomorphic language, so I can only assume it's literal). The Psalmist adds: ""How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How vast is the sum of them!"" (Psalm 139:17). Thomists, on the other hand, believe that God does not have multiple thoughts; instead, He has only one thought, viz., His thought of Himself, and He knows creatures by knowing Himself.      3\. It's grounded in a philosophically dubious ontology: creatures are said to be compounds of essence and existence, while God alone is an Act of Pure and Infinite Existence, which is incapable of possessing any modifications or attributes (such as thoughts and intentions). However, the arguments for a real distinction between essence and existence in creatures prove no such thing: all they prove is that matter and form are distinct (which is why I can know what a Thylacine [or Tasmanian tiger] is, without knowing whether it currently exists or not: I don't know for sure if its form is still instantiated anywhere on Earth). What's more, the notion of Pure Existence is utterly vague: it is indefinite rather than infinite. Better to say, rather, that God is the Ultimate Yardstick of existence. He defines what it means for us to exist, for ""in him we live, and move, and have our being"" (Acts 17:28).      4\. Thomists also contend that God, the Author of nature, could have made a different world, or no world at all, without having any different mental acts, such as intentions. That's like an author saying, “I could have written a totally different story, or even no story at all, without there being any difference in my intentions.”      5\. Why is there a world? The Thomist’s answer is: “Because God.” But if there were a different world, or no world at all, the Thomist's reply would be the same: ""Because God."" I respectfully submit that any explanation which is elastic enough to account for BOTH the world’s occurrence AND its non- occurrence is not doing the work of an explanation at all. It's vacuous.      6\. Finally, if there's one thing Scripture is quite clear about, it is that God is a Father. And as the doctrine of the Trinity shows, even without creating anything, He'd still be one. That's a basic fact about God, and it shows He's personal all the way down.",hi ed respectfully put thomistic doctrine divine simplicity defending passed use-by date following reason taught church merely affirms god “ one essence substance nature absolutely simple ” lateran iv nothing whether god contingent thought plan intention capacity creator cosmos addition possessing nature necessary totally unscriptural bible depicts god explicitly declaring thought plural thought isaiah verse affirming divine transcendence last place one would expect anthropomorphic language assume literal psalmist add precious also thought god vast sum psalm thomists hand believe god multiple thought instead one thought viz thought know creature knowing grounded philosophically dubious ontology creature said compound essence existence god alone act pure infinite existence incapable possessing modification attribute thought intention however argument real distinction essence existence creature prove thing prove matter form distinct know thylacine tasmanian tiger without knowing whether currently exists know sure form still instantiated anywhere earth notion pure existence utterly vague indefinite rather infinite better say rather god ultimate yardstick existence defines mean u exist live move act thomists also contend god author nature could made different world world without different mental act intention like author saying “ could written totally different story even story without difference intention ” world answer “ god ” different world world reply would god respectfully submit explanation elastic enough account occurrence non- occurrence work explanation vacuous finally one thing scripture quite clear god father doctrine trinity show even without creating anything still one basic fact god show personal way,theist,2992,1

According to Schmid, an “intrinsic causal factor or force would be something like a natural tendency, inclination, or disposition inherent to a thing”, whereas “an extrinsic one would be something like the effect of gravity, friction, and so on” (Forthcoming).

First, merely from the fact that no essential component of something accounts for its existence, it doesn’t follow that it is thereby a dependent thing.

But, clearly, it doesn’t follow that something in which essence and existence are identical is a dependent thing. Second, even if every essence-existence composite—even at non-first moments of their existence—were _dependent_ , this is ambiguous between _concurrent, sustaining causal_ dependence and _explanatory_ dependence. The former disambiguation is question-begging in this dialectical context, since the very question at issue is whether essence- existence composites require a concurrent, sustaining cause.

1473,"This is the right approach, however, from what I've read so far it's overcomplicated by Aristotle and Aquinas. The Greek model for human rights is not universal but tied to the idea of AUTOCHTHONY and would JUSTIFY chattel slavery.   Paul addressed AUTOCHTHONY directly in his Mars hill discourse in Acts 17 countering the dispute concerning birth from a particular area to one BLOOD, in law a common human consanguinity which having the evidence of mixed races or ethnicities is evidence of common humanity due therefore common equity (dikaiosune, see Aristotle BOOK 5 NICHOMACHEAN ETHICS).   He then established the common observation that in one theos all live and move and have being which relates back to the first observation that they had many gods each of which protected certain classes of rights when given obeisance. The unknown one Theos being the god upon whom even the other gods demiurgos we're dependent.   Then he established the ideal judge who could advocate the natural rights of those in the image of the invisible Theos who is not in the image or location chosen by men but has established equity in the image of God in the god man in whom are all actual subjective rights obvious by natural law made objective because HE will judge in that equity, justice, righteousness, dikaiosune, mishpat and God has given proof of this by raising him from the dead signifying he is eternal and has the power over life and death for all in his image.   Paul draws this human rights argument directly from the old testament description of messiah the Christ not Greek philosophy he has simply explained it so that greeks could understand it. This is the same structure used in the prologue to John's Gospel, beginning with IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE LOGOS, the logos became flesh, that becoming flesh gave us equity and the authority to claim the title of an inheritance of rights i.e THE SONS OF GOD, our duty then, his law is to love and protect the legitimate rights of others as we love and protect our own rights, knowing these rights came from God by grace and the truth concerning the fact of the matter that is the Christ.   I don't see how philosophy can improve on this although it may help to understand it, but it doesn't improve upon but rather is corrected by the new testament based on the two great commandments with respect to God's rights and our rights in common as neighbors and the explanation in the prophets such as ISAIAH who goes into great detail on the subject of equity of rights in the human image of God YHVHJESUS.

1046,"@ Walter Van den Acker,      ""Obviously God only had to obey your logic.""      That is nothing like what I said.      ""I don't avoid challenge,, but real challenge requires real arguments, and I don't see any from you.""      You do avoid challenge and you avoid mine because you can't answer it.      You would first have to understand the consequences of the bitwise XOR operation between a bitwise random sequence and an intelligible sequence. I will start with finite sequences and we can think of them as displayed on a computer screen under some standard protocol that displays sequences of bits as words on a computer screen, or at least it does if the sequence of bits are not such that what is displayed is nonsense. Now I can get a random sequence with 50/50 bits by a physical process. It could actually display as something intelligible but it is not likely.      Let us call this random sequence A. Let us call B an actually intelligible sequence. It consists of meaningful words converted into a sequence of bits so that they will display as the meaningful words when displayed under the standard protocol being used.      It can easily be shown that when a third sequence, C, is created by doing the operation A XOR B -> C, that C is as random as A and is as unlikely as A to display as anything meaningful.      Now, the beginning of a system:      It can also easily be shown that A, B, and C, together, have the property such that any two of them produce the third sequence when the bitwise XOR operation is performed on the other two. Thus:      A XOR B -> C,   B XOR C -> A, and   C XOR A -> B.      As stated above as easily demonstrated, if A is random, then so is C. But we began with a random A and then chose B to be intelligible, so if we XOR the two random sequences (""disordered"" is a better word here than ""random"", but for now I stick with ""random""), we get the intelligible sequence that we purposely chose. Now here is the crux of the beginning of the system:      The random sequence A that we began with cannot, by itself, give us the chosen sequence B. A is random after all. It could have been any similarly random sequence, so if any random sequence could be decoded into the chosen sequence, how could it be decoded into a different chosen sequence had a different one been chosen? If there was some process dependent upon the chosen sequence by which any random sequence could be decoded into the particular chosen sequence, then the chosen sequence would already have to be known before the correct process that works could be used. So the random sequence A cannot have, intrinsic to itself, the information thatispecifies the chosen sequence. Furthermore, since the second random sequence was produced using the XOR operation with the chosen sequence and the chosen sequence could have been _any_ intelligible sequence, we have that a second random sequence C exists for any initial random A and chosen B. For random A there exists a random C that gives B, the intelligible sequence, no matter what intelligible sequence Biwas chosen.      By just guessing at what C happens to be, A XOR C is most likely nonsense, but if it results in an intelligible B, it is very unlikely to be the pre-chosen B. It is in fact as likely as correctly guessing the pre-chosen B from all possible intelligible sequences (this is slightly simplified for clarity).      This is the beginning of a system based on simplicity that will show that God does not have to be ruled by the logic that you, Walter, futilely use to try to impose your own ideas as limits on God.

2104,"A helpful and informative discussion. I will break up my reflection in multiple posts, since what I have to say is too long for a single comment.      One point I see consistently unmentioned in various assessments of Honorius I have read online over the years, though, is the importance of the distinction between formal and material heresy. I do not know when this distinction came to be (ahem) formally recognized in Catholic thought, but I suspect it was after the period of Honorius.      What is significant in this in respect to the later Vatican I's declaration of papal primacy of jurisdiction is that the Pope himself is the final court of appeal. Hence, in many cases someone might not be aware of their heresy, and hold it materially but not formally (insofar as they are not consciously and obstinately asserting a view contrary to the teaching of the Church, as made clear to them by the ecclesial authorities). In other words, it is ultimately up the ecclesial authorities, and ultimately via appeal to the Pope himself, to declare a view heretical.      It seems that it is only at that point that one who continues to hold the problematic view can be definitively called a formal heretic (such would apply earlier, of course, if the person himself acknowledged his view was heretical, but said he did not care, etc.). But in the case of one who does not consider his view heretical, it would require ecclesial judgment, and even this could be overridden by the Pope via appeal. That would be the final say, at least in that Pope's lifetime (another wrinkle in the case of Honorius, on which i'll comment more in a moment).

2240,"@Miguel      It might be framed this way: Under what conditions do we ""instruct the ignorant"" and under what conditions to we ""rebuke the sinner"".

This entails that we are able to recognize and distinguish malice and ignorance. I think learning to do this effectively is critical for being able to effectively win people to the truth. If you rebuke a sincerely mistaken person for their mistake, this is unnecessary. Such a person just needs instruction. If you give instruction to a malicious person, this is uneffective because they don't care at all about the truth. Such a person doesn't need to be taught, he needs to be rebuked.

1879,"Am I missing something or does this text (as well as Fr. Rooney) commit a basic mistake in logic? Hart's necessitarianism is not a necessary condition for 1.      ""1. that God could not do otherwise than cause human beings to love him""      Even assuming universalism requires 1, the ""could not do otherwise"" clause is a conditional one. That is to say, *if* God creates humans, God cannot do otherwise than cause human beings to love him. This is consistent with there being a possible world in which God does NOT create anything, or creates a universe with no human beings in it. It is only inconsistent with God creating a world with humans and then having said humans not love him/be damned in the end.

First, the passage equivocates between ‘contingent’ in the sense of ‘possibly absent from reality’ (on the one hand) and ‘dependent upon another’ (on the other).[23] Second, and more importantly, when one accepts the necessary (and _independent_ ) existence of a non-purely actual thing (like the God of neo-classical theism), one does not say that it ‘exists by virtue of having potentialities that need to be actualized’. One is only saying that the being in question has various potentialities to _accidentally change_ , none of which _require_ actualization _in order_ for the being in question to exist.

That would be as absurd as, say, a Platonist arguing that something other than the Form of the Good might in _principle_ be responsible for things having whatever measure of goodness they have, but that this is improbable given the empirical evidence. Or it is as absurd as a mathematician proposing that there is solid confirming empirical evidence that makes it probable that 12 x 48 = 576. The point isn’t that we don’t need to provide an argument for the claim that 12 x 48 = 576, or for the claim that there is such a thing as the Form of the Good, or, again, for the claim that the world could not exist even in principle apart from God. The point, again, is that the _kind_ of argumentation we would have to give would not involve forming hypotheses and then coming up with ways to test them empirically.

1719,"An essential part of the interpretative context is surely Pope Francis' Apostolic Exhortation 'Evangelii Gaudium': 'On the Proclamation of the Gospel in Today's World' - considered a keynote document of his pontificate, and running to 288 numbered paragraphs. Less authoritative and isolated statements should be interpreted in the light of more authoritative and extended statements such as this.      A few quotes:      ‘Throughout the world, let us be “permanently in a state of mission”.’ (25; cf. passim)      ‘All the baptized, whatever their position in the Church or their level of instruction in the faith, are agents of evangelization.’ (120)      ‘All revealed truths derive from the same divine source and are to be believed with the same faith…’ (36)      ‘Of course, we will never be able to make the Church’s teachings easily understood or readily appreciated by everyone. Faith always remains something of a cross; it retains a certain obscurity which does not detract from the firmness of its assent.’ (42)      ‘Proclaiming the Gospel message to different cultures also involves proclaiming it to professional, scientific and academic circles. This means an encounter between faith, reason and the sciences with a view to developing new approaches and arguments on the issue of credibility, a creative apologetics which would encourage greater openness to the Gospel on the part of all. When certain categories of reason and the sciences are taken up into the proclamation of the message, these categories then become tools of evangelization; water is changed into wine.’ (132)      ‘Evangelization with joy becomes beauty in the liturgy, as part of our daily concern to spread goodness. The Church evangelizes and is herself evangelized through the beauty of the liturgy, which is both a celebration of the task of evangelization and the source of her renewed self-giving.’ (24)      ‘As the bishops of the United States of America have rightly pointed out, while the Church insists on the existence of objective moral norms which are valid for everyone, there are those in our culture who portray this teaching as unjust, that is, as opposed to basic human rights. Such claims usually follow from a form of moral relativism that is joined, not without inconsistency, to a belief in the absolute rights of individuals.’ (64)      ‘Among the vulnerable for whom the Church wishes to care with particular love and concern are unborn children, the most defenceless and innocent among us. Nowadays efforts are made to deny them their human dignity and to do with them whatever one pleases, taking their lives and passing laws preventing anyone from standing in the way of this. Frequently, as a way of ridiculing the Church’s effort to defend their lives, attempts are made to present her position as ideological, obscurantist and conservative. Yet this defence of unborn life is closely linked to the defence of each and every other human right… This is not something subject to alleged reforms or “modernizations”. It is not “progressive” to try to resolve problems by eliminating a human life.’ (213)      ‘A facile syncretism would ultimately be a totalitarian gesture on the part of those who would ignore greater values of which they are not the masters. True openness involves remaining steadfast in one’s deepest convictions, clear and joyful in one’s own identity, while at the same time being “open to understanding those of the other party” and “knowing that dialogue can enrich each side” (John Paul II). What is not helpful is a diplomatic openness which says “yes” to everything in order to avoid problems, for this would be a way of deceiving others and denying them the good which we have been given to share generously with others. Evangelization and interreligious dialogue, far from being opposed, mutually support and nourish one another.’ (251)      All this may not resolve all the issues with things Francis has said and done, but it needs to be taken into account.

1307,"Walter,      I don't think I understand your response. I did not mean to suggest that God could not have stopped the Fall (if ""the Fall"" happened; I was just using that as an example) with sheer power, but rather that a world like ours in which the Fall happened might be better than a world in which the Fall never happened. Or that, from the point of view of perfect rationality, one should not have attempted to prevent the Fall. It seems to me that there are many possible reasons, even beyond our ken, for why God could not have prevented the Fall without some immorality, or perhaps without sacrificing a greater good that could morally justify his inaction.      I do not deny that there is a plausibility to thinking that, prima facie, if God existed, the world should look a lot better than it is. Speaking for myself, I think it raises the probability of atheism to some degree, but I find it very hard to go beyond a prima facie impression here. It seems the problem of evil would require us to adopt a ""God's eye"" point of view that I don't think people can reliably have (I certainly can't have it, at the moment). I am not even sure enough about everything in morality. There are moral dillemas that I am unsure about, for example.      And while it strikes me as absolutely obvious that (e.g.) having an innocent person being tortured forever for no reason would be necessarily horrible, and the kind of thing that God/a perfect being could not do or be okay with, I am not at all sure about (and even see some plausibility in) theodicies where suffering builds a person's character (perhaps even in heaven, looking back?) and could contribute to a better end-state in the world and the victim will be in heaven in eternal happiness, etc.      I do not think that we can reliably have a ""God's eye"" point of view for the evils in the world to confidently say that a perfect being couldn't have permitted them, or that there could be no morally justifiable plan behind it, etc. I know that God (if God exists) could not be indifferent to them or not- intervening for no good reason. But I do not know enough to confidently say that there can be no reason for it all.

2850,"Second, the principle <if one can ask and answer the question of why a thing possesses a property, then one causally explain the possession of that property> seems straightforwardly false. Suppose Stephen is hanging out with two friends, Cameron and Joe. Suppose Stephen has 23 cookies and wants to give each of his two friends the same whole number of cookies without any left over. To his dismay, he finds that he can’t do this. What explains the fact that Stephen’s desire has the property _being frustrated_? The explanation is in terms of _mathematical constraints_ : 23 cannot be divided by 2 to yield a whole number. Importantly, though, this is not a causal explanation. The relevant non-divisibility of 23 isn’t _causing_ Stephen’s desire to be frustrated. Nevertheless, it _explains_ it. And, indeed, this is the _only_ explanation of why the desire is frustrated. (We are not asking why Stephen exists, or why his desire exists, or whatever; we are asking why the relevant desire is frustrated _given_ that he exists, has the relevant desire, and so on.)

2838,"Now, as Jeffrey Brower notes, the idea that either Aquinas or Aristotle should be interpreted as having offered a view in terms of restricted existential quantification would be “hopelessly anachronistic” (Brower 2014, p. 54). To be sure, Aristotle (1933) did hold that being is said in many ways ( _Metaphysics_ IV.2 and VII.1), and so Aristotle should be understood as a pluralist. But the logical machinery of existential quantification (at least as presently understood) did not yet exist at the time when either Aquinas or Aristotle were writing. Nonetheless, Feser and other current friends of the Aristotelian proof _do_ have access to the full logical machinery of existential quantification. Furthermore, when Gottlob Frege and other logicians invented existential quantification, they were modeling a phenomenon that appears in natural language, that is, one and the same linguistic phenomenon that Aquinas and Aristotle were utilizing when they discussed being. Brower (2014, p. 51–54) provides three reasons for thinking that we ought to interpret Aquinas and Aristotle as pluralists and that their views can fruitfully be interpreted in terms of restricted existential quantification. First, restricted existential quantification can help us make sense of both Aquinas’s notion that there are modes of being and can help us make sense of the analogy of being. Second, restricted existential quantification can help to clarify, articulate, and answer interpretational questions that arise about Aquinas’s notion that there are distinct modes of being. Third, restricted existential quantification can help us interpret Aquinas’s discussion of the ultimate categories of being, including the total number of ways of being (Brower 2014, p. 52). (Brower counts fourteen fundamental ways of being in Aquinas’s ontology.) We can also identify another set of reasons that (neo-)Aristotelian or (neo-)Thomistic metaphysics should be understood as involving pluralism—namely, that present-day attempts to render Aristotelian metaphysics defensible have understood Aristotelian “ways of being” explicitly in terms of restricted existential quantification (see, e.g., McDaniel (2009; 2010a; 2010b; 2017) and Turner (2010; 2012; 2021).)",jeffrey brower note idea either aquinas aristotle interpreted offered view term restricted existential quantification would “ hopelessly anachronistic ” brower p sure aristotle hold said many way metaphysics iv vii aristotle understood pluralist logical machinery existential quantification least presently understood yet exist time either aquinas aristotle writing nonetheless feser current friend aristotelian proof access full logical machinery existential quantification furthermore gottlob frege logician invented existential quantification modeling phenomenon appears natural language one linguistic phenomenon aquinas aristotle utilizing discussed brower p – provides three reason thinking ought interpret aquinas aristotle pluralist view fruitfully interpreted term restricted existential quantification first restricted existential quantification help u make sense notion mode help u make sense analogy second restricted existential quantification help clarify articulate answer interpretational question arise notion distinct mode third restricted existential quantification help u interpret discussion ultimate category including total number way brower p brower count fourteen fundamental way ontology also identify another set reason neo-aristotelian neo-thomistic metaphysics understood involving pluralism—namely present-day attempt render aristotelian metaphysics defensible understood aristotelian “ way ” explicitly term restricted existential quantification see eg mcdaniel b turner,sceptic,2237,0

2165,"@ Laudator Temporis Acti,      ""Why did you think I said 'under classic conditions'?""      I have no idea what you mean by ""classic conditions"". The geometry of the surface of a sphere goes back to the Greek mathematitions of classic Greece in the 5th century BC.      ""However, the differing accounts of infallibility do PROVE that humans can be wrong about infallibility.""      You are hiding behind a funny obsession about infallibility. The joke is that it amounts to a useless and ridiculous infinite regress. I.e. ""You are not infallible about that"" ... ""Yes, but you are not infallible about _that_"" ... ""Sure, but you are absolutely not infallible about_THAT_, etc, etc, etc ad infinitum.      Humans are going to talk about things anyway. If you are going to try to block these things by saying ""not infallible"", why not say nothing because you are not infallible either.      Sheesh!      :-)      ""But can he create a physical universe containing 127 and 128 in which the former is not prime and the latter is not a power of 2?""      Yes.      Every created thing is an image of God even though the created thing may not seem like God at all. We say that the image exists pre-eminently in God. So if one says a house is like the architect who designed it, we say that the house exists pre-eminently as an image in the mind of the architect, and he creates his observable plan drawings from the unobservable image in his mind and the house is built from these drawings by his agent, the carpenter. So the house is an image of the architect. This is straight out of Aquinas.      In the same way, I can specify a model, or image, of God. The model exists pre-eminently in God and is like Him, even though it is just me who specifies the model. God is not limited by the limitations of the model, but what can be shown in the model exists pre-eminently in God.      The model, or likeness, is an infinite unbiased binary sequence of 50/50 bits. All finite subsequences exist within this infinite sequence. If the consecutive binary digits are each 50/50, then the infinite sequence is a normal sequence. Even so, any subsequence of specified finite length could be missing a particular sub-sub-sequence of itself because such a subsequence itself must appear normally within the infinite sequence. Therefore, discovery by bitwise examination of a subsequence of finite length, no matter how long, that misses a particular sub-sub-sequence cannot be a demonstration that the infinite sequence is not normal.      A description of finite space and time is encoded by a finite subsequence of the infinite normal sequence. A computer that can run the subsequence as a program, including memory, could virtually reproduce all that we experience of reality, given the finite resolution of our senses in time and space. We would not be able to tell whether a missing sub-sub-sequence would exist further along in time in which the rules of arithmetic are no longer what they were. Since the infinite sequence is of random bits, the rules of arithmetic really are not rules. They have just appeared to be rules by random chance. The model, as explained, does not specify God or God's will. So we cannot say from the model whether God could change what appeared to be rules of arithmetic into completely different rules where 128 is not a power of 2 and 127 is a composite number.

For the former posits not only more _entities_ (namely, timeless concreta in addition to temporal concreta, as well as relations obtaining between the two) but also more _kinds_ of entities (namely, the new category of _timeless concreta_ ).

2617,"Because the argument requires that God have an _esse_ or act of existence different from creaturely acts of existence. Under such a view, God and creatures _exist in different ways_. For suppose that God’s existence was the same existence as creatures’ existence. Since God is identical to his existence, it would follow that creatures’ existence _just is_ God. But this is absurd for several reasons. First, with ordinary objects like “stones, trees, dogs, human beings, and the like… there is in each of them a real distinction between its essence and its existence” (Feser 2017, p. 122). The distinction is _in_ objects, i.e., it is _within_ them or _intrinsic_ to them. (At least, that’s how _I_ read the passage.) If I read the passage right, then essence and existence are _component parts_ of ordinary objects. But God is obviously not a component part of things. Second, “there is no such thing in mind-independent reality as a thing’s essence existing apart from its existence (whatever that would mean) or a thing’s existence existing apart from its essence (whatever that would mean)” (2017, p. 123). But if a thing’s existence is identical to God, then clearly a thing’s existence can exist apart from its essence, since God can exist apart from anything else (had he chosen to refrain from creating). Third, the argument says (or requires, or entails, or whatever) that the existence of creatures must be caused by something outside it—something which adds existence to its essence, as it were. Thus, if God were identical to ordinary objects’ existence, then God would be caused. But God is not caused. For these three reasons, it follows that creatures’ existence is not identical to God (and hence God’s existence). And as we’ve seen, this entails pluralism about being. Hence, the De Ente argument requires pluralism about being: God and creatures exist in different ways. God’s existence is not the same existence as creaturely existence.",argument requires god esse act existence different creaturely act existence view god creature exist different way suppose existence existence existence since god identical existence would follow existence god absurd several reason first ordinary object like “ stone tree dog human being like… real distinction essence existence ” feser p distinction object ie within intrinsic least read passage read passage right essence existence component part ordinary object god obviously component part thing second “ thing mind-independent reality essence existing apart existence whatever would mean existence existing apart essence whatever would mean ” p existence identical god clearly existence exist apart essence since god exist apart anything else chosen refrain creating third argument say requires entail whatever existence creature must caused something outside it—something add existence essence thus god identical ordinary existence god would caused god caused three reason follows existence identical god hence existence seen entail pluralism hence de ente argument requires pluralism god creature exist different way existence existence creaturely existence,sceptic,1956,0

Now, such a perfection supervenes on the GSA*-property – and so, either the GSA*-property, by a plausible supervenience principle, is itself a perfection or it is a necessary condition of a perfection.
