696,"All the same, Kant’s critique of natural theology did not stem from the view that it is an irrational enterprise.  Quite the contrary. The New Atheist supposes that all theology reflects an insufficient respect for reason. Kant argues, by contrast, that in fact natural theology reflects an _excessive confidence_ in the power of reason. In particular, it reflects the conviction that ultimate explanation is possible, that the world can be made intelligible through and through. Nor did Kant suppose that natural theology looked for such explanation in the crudely anthropomorphic “sky daddy” of New Atheist caricature. Here is how he describes the basic impulse behind philosophical theism in the _Critique of Pure Reason_ :",critique natural theology stem view irrational enterprise quite contrary new atheist supposes theology reflects insufficient respect reason kant argues contrast fact natural theology reflects excessive confidence power reason particular reflects conviction ultimate explanation possible world made intelligible kant suppose natural theology looked explanation crudely anthropomorphic “ sky daddy ” new atheist caricature describes basic impulse behind philosophical theism critique pure reason,theist,726
993,"Or consider a naturalistic view according to which there exist ultimate, fundamental constituents of physical reality (whether they be particles (like quarks), one or more foundational physical fields, or what have you).

It’s not at all clear why or how temperature, pressure, and the other factors cited are even relevant to the ground layer of physical reality.

1517,"We could put Oderberg’s argument for the tendency to persist as follows. We observe temporal concrete objects ceasing to exist when and only when subjected to sufficiently destructive factors/forces. But this universal phenomenon cries out for some explanation, just as objects’ ceasing to exist when and only when next to objects twice their size does. The best or only explanation for this phenomenon is that such objects possess some tendency to cease to exist when and only when subject to such sufficiently destructive factors.[6] But tendencies imply their complements; in other words, the possession of a tendency to cease to exist in certain conditions—“a specific disposition activated by a relatively limited kind and range of stimuli”—implies the possession of “a tendency to _continue_ to exist absent those stimuli” ( _ibid_ ). Hence, temporal concrete objects have a tendency to persist in existence.[7]",could put argument tendency persist follows observe temporal concrete object ceasing exist subjected sufficiently destructive factorsforces universal phenomenon cry explanation ceasing exist next object twice size best explanation phenomenon object posse tendency cease exist subject sufficiently destructive factor tendency imply complement word possession tendency cease exist certain conditions— “ specific disposition activated relatively limited kind range stimulus ” —implies possession “ tendency continue exist absent stimulus ” ibid hence temporal concrete object tendency persist existence,sceptic,917

647,"@Walter      ""The main point is whether we could call a being who wants a world of suffering ""good.""      Well, we can't. I do call Him Goodness Itself and other cool names, though.      A essencial part of this christian theodicy* is that God has a relation with morality totally diferent than our own, see for instance the fact that He can judge people, can kill people, can pester people until they want to do His thing(see Jonah) etc. The Book of Job lets this clear when God finally appears, for Job is trying to tread God as a equal the whole time, who needs to explain His actions to him and all that, and when He finally appears He makes very clear that Job treatment of Him as how we would do a normal person is completely ridiculous.      So the idea that God is good yes but on a more analogical than univocal way is not a clever apologetical invention but is there on the religions of the book since the beginning. It just sounds bizarre to me to see someone argue otherwise, specially when the ""the names Scripture uses to talk of God should not be understood as exactly what they mean in us"" is a thing since the church fathers.      This is important, for if God goodness is not exactly our own them His priorities can be diferent. And, well, on the christian worldview the struggle a believer has to be become holy, the life and struggles of the animals etc are goods that let the universe better.      Notice that even we can see value in something that requires suffering. For instance, would you rather we, suppose we could, put all savage animals in zoos and other controlated environments and make the ecosistems that exist now stay functioning artificially or you would want to also let places were there are animals living like they do and only interfere to not let extinctions and things like that happen?      *if this is the right name",walter main point whether could call want world suffering good well call goodness cool name though essencial part christian theodicy god relation morality totally diferent see instance fact judge people kill people pester people want thingsee jonah etc book job let clear god finally appears job trying tread god equal whole time need explain action finally appears make clear job treatment would normal person completely ridiculous idea god good yes analogical univocal way clever apologetical invention religion book since beginning sound bizarre see someone argue otherwise specially name scripture us talk god understood exactly mean u thing since church father important god goodness exactly priority diferent well christian worldview struggle believer become holy life struggle animal etc good let universe better notice even see value something requires suffering instance would rather suppose could put savage animal zoo controlated environment make ecosistems exist stay functioning artificially would want also let place animal living like interfere let extinction thing like happen right name,theist,1861

1599,"Now, one might at this juncture raise worries for this last example. Here are two worries one might level. First, one might question whether there even _is_ such a fundamental, ultimate ground layer of physical reality. That’s a good question, but it misunderstands the dialectical context at hand. Feser is aiming to give a _positive demonstration_ of NPCP. One of the approaches he takes to justifying this is _step three_ (as we’ve outlined it), which appeals to (purportedly) clear cases of composite objects’ being sustained in being by a pre-existent physical context. But as we argued in the previous paragraph, one clear way to circumvent this justification is to hold that there _is_ such a fundamental, ground layer to physical reality that provides a context for less fundamental physical realities but does not itself have some more fundamental physical context. Given that this circumvents step three, it follows that the success of step three as a justification for NPCP _presupposes_ that there couldn’t be such a fundamental, ground layer as we’ve described it. The onus of justification is therefore on _Feser_ to justify why there couldn’t be such a layer. Without such justification, step three rests on an unjustified presupposition.",one might juncture raise worry last example two worry one might level first one might question whether even fundamental ultimate ground layer physical reality good question misunderstands dialectical context hand feser aiming give positive demonstration npcp one approach take justifying step three outlined appeal purportedly clear case composite sustained pre-existent physical context argued previous paragraph one clear way circumvent justification hold fundamental ground layer physical reality provides context le fundamental physical reality fundamental physical context given circumvents step three follows success step three justification npcp presupposes fundamental ground layer described onus justification therefore feser justify layer without justification step three rest unjustified presupposition,sceptic,1253

1145,"[8] Indeed, those unsympathetic to existential inertia—that is, those who hold that all temporal concreta are sustained or conserved in existence from without—are entirely free to recognize the legitimacy of transtemporal explanations. Consider, for instance, Pruss: “Plausibly, your existence at earlier times causes your existence at later times” (2018, p. 167). For further discussion/justification of transtemporal explanatory relations, see Schmid (2021) and Swinburne (1994, pp. 81-90). Note, though, that transtemporal accounts do not say that all causation is non-simultaneous. (Indeed, they are not _necessarily_ wedded to viewing the relevant transtemporal explanatory relation as causal, as we’ve seen.) Final note: one objection to transtemporal accounts derives from the conjunction of presentism and the thesis that explanatory relations are existence-entailing.

728,"Kant was one of the world's greatest thinkers. He phillosophy foresaw quantum mechanics.      Kant did not view things-in-themselves as containing the sum of all possibilities, and phenomena all actualities; but this duality is conformable to Kant's metaphysics as to none other. As a contribution to the metaphysics of possibility, the quantum mechanical wave function can easily be seen as complementary to Kant's idea of things-in-themselves, where various kinds of things can happen (like free will) that are not comprehensible in terms of phenomenal reality. Kant would just have to allow that characteristics of physical reality can intrude some depth into things-in-themselves, which he would not have considered -- though we can also handle this by positing an intermediate level of reality, between true unconditioned things-in-themselves and true discrete phenomenal objects -- as Kant otherwise actually does himself for space and time as ""pure intuitions."" The wave function straddles the classic Kantian boundary, sharing some properties with phenomena, others, as underlying phenomena, with things-in-themselves.      Thus, where Kant would have considered all of phenomena governed by determinism, we now see the wave function as deterministic, while the collapse of waves into particles is random. Although chance in quantum mechanics has often been argued as allowing for free will, a free cause is still a very different thing from a random cause, which doesn't need mind or self or intention. Moral freedom is thus still left among things-in-themselves. Kant himself would have had difficulty placing randomness in his ontology, if he, like Hume, believed that chance violates determinism. Since chance is now part of the physics, it cannot be denied; but it also still remains a different matter from purposive freedom.      Kant's idea that space and time do not exist among things-in-themselves has been curiously affirmed by Relativity and quantum mechanics. In Relativity, time simply ceases to pass at the velocity of light: for photons that have travelled to us as part of the Cosmic Background Radiation, time has stood still for most of the history of the universe. On the other hand, quantum mechanics now posits ""non-locality,"" i.e. physical distances, and so the limitation of the velocity of light in Relativity, don't seem to exist. This means that although time may apply to the wave function, space may not. The full empirical reality of space is only found among discrete particles and objects.      This curious result is the consequence of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Paradox, which was intended by Einstein as a reductio ad absurdum of quantum mechanics. If, for instance, a positron and an election are both created from an energetic photon, the conservation of angular momentum requires that one be spinning one way, and the other the other. But the complementary spins are equally probable for each particle. Thus, in quantum mechanical terms, the wave functions of each particle divide without a discrete state being determined. The particles might then separate to even cosmological distances, but as soon as the spin of one particle is observed, the other particle must have the opposite spin, which means that the wave function has collapsed across those cosmological distances and caused the other particle to assume a predictable spin. If this occurs instantaneously, it would violate the limitation of the velocity of light in Special Relativity.      This has now been shown to actually occur on the basis of Bell's Theorem (from John Bell, 1928-1990), meaning that Quantum Mechanics does violate Special Relativity by allowing instantaneous interactions across even cosmological distances. However, once observed, processes must still obey Special Relativity and the limitations of spatial distance, creating the kind of duality described by Kant.

1545,"Here’s another way to think about it. Consider again the case of mechanical inertia. One of Feser’s reconciliations of CP with mechanical inertia is to treat uniform rectilinear spatial motion as a mere state or condition of unchangingness. In this way, it does not involve the kind of dynamism that CP says requires a distinct actualizing cause. But when an object is uniformly rectilinearly moving through space, it may be undergoing _other_ , continuous processes of real change. These would—granting the truth of CP—require a continuously operative actualizing cause. But this does not negate or nullify the fact that the object is still in a state or condition of unchangingness w _ith respect to its uniform rectilinear motion_. And so, in _this_ respect, the object does not require a continuously operative cause, though the _other_ respects in which the object _is_ really changing _do_ (or would). And this is precisely the proposal of no-change accounts: although the object may be undergoing a host of real accidental changes (and thus may require continuous causes of such changes), the object is _not_ undergoing the kind of real dynamism or change _in respect of its actuality or existence_ that would require a continuously operative sustaining cause.",here another way think consider case mechanical inertia one reconciliation cp mechanical inertia treat uniform rectilinear spatial motion mere state condition unchangingness way involve kind dynamism cp say requires distinct actualizing cause object uniformly rectilinearly moving space may undergoing continuous process real change would—granting truth cp—require continuously operative actualizing cause negate nullify fact object still state condition unchangingness w ith respect uniform rectilinear motion respect object require continuously operative cause though respect object really changing would precisely proposal no-change account although object may undergoing host real accidental change thus may require continuous cause change object undergoing kind real dynamism change respect actuality existence would require continuously operative sustaining cause,sceptic,1267

One question about killing the leader of an invading country is whether the leader counts as a civilian, since the killing of civilians is forbidden by the Geneva Convention.

So, as a matter of positive international law, it seems a difficult question.      Were there no international law on the matter, I wouldn't see a significant difference between killing a political leader and killing a general, if both are giving orders to fight.

1717,"But this is a mischaracterization of Tomaszewski (2019).[33] Tomaszewski does _not_ say that it is question-begging against the Thomist to say that God is identical to his act _qua_ act of creation. In fact, Tomaszewski _explicitly_ says that DDS is _committed_ to the claim that _God is identical_ _to God’s act of creation_ : “DDS is directly committed only to (2), that is, to the identity of God and His act of creation” (p. 279). What Tomaszewski points out is that the classical theist is committed (and only committed) to denying that it is _necessarily true that_ God is identical to God’s act of creation. Tomaszewski explicitly says that DDS _is_ committed to God’s identity with God’s act of creation; it’s just that DDS must (to avoid modal collapse) hold that this claim is only _contingently true_. It is true in _some_ worlds but not in others. And it’s _contingently_ true because “God’s act of creation” only _non-rigidly_ designates God. It doesn’t pick out God in every possible world in which God exists. It only picks him out in _some_ worlds in which he exists. But it _does_ , indeed, pick him out in the actual world, and so—as Tomaszewski again explicitly says is a commitment of DDS—it is actually true that God is identical to his act of creation.

However we generally make the choice there, we understand how it helps our health. What about a young child forced not to ride it’s tricycle on a busy road, or to take some bad tasting medicine. In these cases most children don’t understand the end good. A few children may trust their parents, and so for them (and there parents!) it’s not really a problem. For others, the hurt and pain they feel at the unfairness of it all often causes them far more problems than the bad taste or the limited cycling options.      “That's like the fire brigade.

As Oliver Passon describes the view of Feynman diagrams popular among philosophers of physics, Feynman diagrams (emphasis his) “visualize _formulae_ and not physical _processes_ ” (2019, pg. 1; see Passon’s paper, and references therein, for additional arguments against the naive literal reading of Feynman diagrams).

1099,"Naturally, debates concerning divine aseity overlap quite heavily with the considerations adduced above. According to divine aseity, God is “an absolutely independent being—a being that does not depend on anything else for its existence” (Fowler 2015, p. 115). One of the principal motivations for DDS derives from aseity. If there were some item intrinsic to but distinct from God—that is, if God had some part—then God would be dependent on something that is distinct from God. As Aquinas writes, “every composite is posterior to its component parts, and is dependent on them; but God is the first being” ( _Summa Theologiae_ I, q3 a7). One influential response to this line of reasoning derives from what Fowler calls the _Doctrine of Divine Priority (DDP)_ : “For all x, if x is a proper part of God or x is a property of God, then x depends on God for its existence” (2015, p. 122). And since dependence is asymmetric, God does not depend on God’s parts. Like Baddorf, then, Fowler offers whole-to-part grounding as a viable model for understanding divine aseity and the independence of at least one whole.",naturally debate concerning divine aseity overlap quite heavily consideration adduced according divine aseity god “ absolutely independent being—a depend anything else existence ” fowler p one principal motivation dd derives aseity item intrinsic distinct god—that god part—then god would dependent something distinct god aquinas writes “ every composite posterior component part dependent god first ” summa theologiae q one influential response line reasoning derives fowler call doctrine divine priority ddp “ x x proper part god x property god x depends god existence ” p since dependence asymmetric god depend part like baddorf fowler offer whole-to-part grounding viable model understanding divine aseity independence least one whole,sceptic,1111

When you need food, or there is a lion at the cave entrance, you don’t want to be thinking about ways to make clothes, how the sun moves through the sky etc. In the modern world the foundations of the wall tend to be physics, chemistry, maths, geology, economics, politics etc, which themselves have foundations built on a reduction to small things (pebbles). Once you believe in God, that is always the foundation stone. To me this is why literalist, fundamentalist protestants have such a problem with science, but that’s a different subject.

First, merely from the fact that no essential component of something accounts for its existence, it doesn’t follow that it is thereby a dependent thing.

But, clearly, it doesn’t follow that something in which essence and existence are identical is a dependent thing. Second, even if every essence-existence composite—even at non-first moments of their existence—were _dependent_ , this is ambiguous between _concurrent, sustaining causal_ dependence and _explanatory_ dependence. The former disambiguation is question-begging in this dialectical context, since the very question at issue is whether essence- existence composites require a concurrent, sustaining cause.

1763,"In terms of expositing classical theistic and Thomistic views, there isn’t much to complain about here. My sole suggestion would be to include an analysis of _what it is to be a part_ under classical theism. Typically, for classical theists, some x is a part of substance S just in case (i) x is some positive ontological item intrinsic to S and (ii) x is distinct from S.[26] More simply (and applied to God), anything intrinsic to God is identical to God (Fakhri 2021). This understanding of parts accords well with how the Doctrine of Divine Simplicity (DDS) is traditionally articulated. As Augustine famously articulated it, God _is_ what God _has_ (Augustine, _The City of God_ , XI, 10). Similarly with Anselm: addressing God, Anselm writes in his _Proslogion_ that “you are whatever you are . . . you are the very life by which you live, the wisdom by which you are wise, the very goodness by which you are good” (2001, ch. 12). Also later in the _Proslogion_ : “[Y]ou are what you are, since whatever you are in any way or at any time, you are wholly and always that” ( _ibid_ , ch. 22). Vallicella (2019) follows suit: “God is ontologically simple . . . there is nothing intrinsic to God that is distinct from God.” Other scholars in models of God are similarly explicit about this conception of parthood in relation to DDS.[27] There are also straightforward paths from other traditional classical theistic commitments to this understanding of parthood, but we needn’t belabor that here.",term expositing classical theistic thomistic view much complain sole suggestion would include analysis part classical theism typically classical theist x part substance case x positive ontological item intrinsic ii x distinct simply applied god anything intrinsic god identical god fakhri understanding part accord well doctrine divine simplicity dd traditionally articulated augustine famously articulated god god augustine city god xi similarly anselm addressing god anselm writes proslogion “ whatever life live wisdom wise goodness good ” ch also later proslogion “ since whatever way time wholly always ” ibid ch vallicella follows suit “ god ontologically simple nothing intrinsic god distinct god ” scholar model god similarly explicit conception parthood relation dd also straightforward path traditional classical theistic commitment understanding parthood belabor,sceptic,1498
1267,"So much, then, for premises (1) and (2). What about premise (3)? I have two replies. First, nothing in the argument or what Kerr says on its behalf in Kerr (Forthcoming) rules out a situation in which an essence-existence composite has existence _neither_ in virtue of what it is _nor_ in virtue of something _ad extra_. In such a case, the essence-existence composite in question would not have existence _in virtue of_ or _from_ anything. Suppose, for instance, that neo-classical theism is true. The neo-classical theistic God’s essence, we can suppose, is not numerically identical to its existence. The neo-classical God, then, is an essence-existence composite.[2] Nevertheless, the neo-classical God is the necessarily existent, unlimited, perfect, ultimate foundation of everything else. He therefore doesn’t exist or obtain _in virtue_ of anything but is instead the uniquely unexplained reality.[3] Everything else, by contrast, is explained ultimately by reference to him. We therefore have a case in which it is _false_ that everything essence-existence composite has its existence _in virtue of_ or _from_ anything. To be sure, _thomists_ would reject this view. But that’s irrelevant. What matters is that _nothing in the argument above or what’s said on its behalf_ gives those who _do_ hold such a view sufficient reason to _abandon_ their position.

816,"**First** , Gel is here resisting the need for individuating properties that explain why the properties _rectangularity_ and _circularity_ are distinct. And his resistance, it seems, is based on the fact that the properties in question are self-evidently distinct and hence don’t need a further explanation for their distinction. The problem with this rejoinder, though, is that _substances are also self-evidently distinct from one another_. To see this, notice that _p_ ’s self-evidence to subject S requires that S grasps the natures of the things reported in _p_. (For instance, that Euclidean triangles have interior angles summing to 180 degrees is not self-evident to my 2-year- old nephew, since he lacks the relevant knowledge about the essences of triangles, degrees, etc. But once one grasps the relevant natures or essences, one thereby _sees_ the relevant truth. This is part of what it is to be _self- evident_.) So, if S doesn’t grasp the natures of _rectangularity_ and _circularity_ , their distinction won’t be self-evident to S. Gel’s response therefore requires a background grasp of the natures of the realities in question. But here’s the rub: with a background grasp of the natures of indiscernible substances A and B, it is _also_ self-evident that A and B are distinct. For part of the nature of any entity is that it is _that particular entity, distinct from other particular entities._[4] Hence, upon grasping the nature of A (say), we would immediately see that it’s distinct from B. But in that case, Gel’s rejoinder here does more harm than good to his case, for his rejoinder _also_ implies that there needn’t be any further explanation for the distinction between _substances_ —in which case, my criticism of the explicability-based motivation for IoI is vindicated.",first gel resisting need individuating property explain property rectangularity circularity distinct resistance seems based fact property question self-evidently distinct hence need explanation distinction problem rejoinder though substance also self-evidently distinct one another see notice p self-evidence subject requires grasp nature thing reported p instance euclidean triangle interior angle summing degree self-evident -year- old nephew since lack relevant knowledge essence triangle degree etc one grasp relevant nature essence one thereby see relevant truth part self- evident grasp nature rectangularity circularity distinction self-evident response therefore requires background grasp nature reality question rub background grasp nature indiscernible substance b also self-evident b distinct part nature entity particular entity distinct particular entity hence upon grasping nature say would immediately see distinct b case rejoinder harm good case rejoinder also implies explanation distinction substance —in case criticism explicability-based motivation ioi vindicated,sceptic,1798

And note that in this dialectical context, the onus is not on _me_ to provide _positive reasons_ to think that hylemorphism is false.

I would argue that the existence of Satan, qua *being* is a positive good, because being is good -- this is Thomism 101. God did not create Satan as Satan; Asking why permit or allow Satan qua Satan, is asking the wrong question. Satan does not exist alone in a vacuum but as an element within the created order. The created order is good (not even Satan wants to destroy it to the point of non-existence which is what you are arguing entails, rather he wants to pervert it to his *own* perverted ends); could there be some created order that is better in some aspect or other, say, without Satan as Satan? Maybe; and? At any rate, we have no way of ascertaining such things.      ""Now, as to us mortals you set-up a false dichotomy.

475,"**Response:** That may be right in the simple case. But now imagine that the “red” set is a saturated nonmeasurable subset of the spinner edge, and the “green” set is also such. A saturated nonmeasurable subset has no reasonable probability assignment, not even a non-trivial range of probabilities like from 1/3 to 1/2 (at best we can assign it the full range from 0 to 1). Now the reason-giving strength of a chancy outcome is proportionate to the probability.

1604,"Friends of simultaneous causation might attempt to argue that causes and effects can concur for another reason. Consider that the interactions between the water and sugar molecules can ultimately be understood in terms of the interactions between electric charges and that the interactions between electric charges are ultimately mediated by photons. For example, when momentum is exchanged between two electrons, we might imagine that one electron transmits a photon, carrying the momentum, and the other electron absorbs that photon, thereby receiving the momentum. When an electron absorbs a photon, we might imagine that the electron and photon coincide at a single space-time point. In the Feynman diagram that illustrates the absorption of a photon by an electron, the point where the electron and photon coincide is called a _vertex_. One might suggest that since the electron and the photon occupy numerically one space-time point at the vertex, the electron and the photon — and so cause and effect — come to be instantaneous by co-occuring at the same space-time point. This attractive picture is presented in popular science documentaries, where one billiard ball — representing the electron — somehow absorbs another billiard ball — representing the photon. Unfortunately, as attractive as this picture is, the picture glosses over a tremendous amount of complexity.",friend simultaneous causation might attempt argue cause effect concur another reason consider interaction water sugar molecule ultimately understood term interaction electric charge interaction electric charge ultimately mediated photon example momentum exchanged two electron might imagine one electron transmits photon carrying momentum electron absorbs photon thereby receiving momentum electron absorbs photon might imagine electron photon coincide single space-time point feynman diagram illustrates absorption photon electron point electron photon coincide called vertex one might suggest since electron photon occupy numerically one space-time point vertex electron photon — cause effect — come instantaneous co-occuring space-time point attractive picture presented popular science documentary one billiard ball — representing electron — somehow absorbs another billiard ball — representing photon unfortunately attractive picture picture gloss tremendous amount complexity,sceptic,1378

For even if its existence at a non-first moment of its life is not due to its essence, it could still be _explained_ without reference to any (concurrent, sustaining) cause. This, of course, was the purpose of the metaphysical accounts of EIT. By contrast, if the latter is meant, then premise (4) is simply false. For it does _not_ follow from the fact that x’s existence is _explained_ by something other than x’s essence that x’s existence must thereby participate in a _cause_ in order to exist.

But we have trouble seeing how this will ultimately work out for another reason. The points on a Cauchy surface are space-like related. For that reason, no signal can propagate between numerically distinct points on a Cauchy surface. And since causes presumably make some difference to their effects, a signal must propagate from cause to effect. (Here, we mean ‘signal’ to be general enough that the cause, itself, might be the signal that reaches the effect.) For the sake of simplicity, suppose that O is a point-like particle and that t is O’s proper time. The only entities that can transmit a signal to O are located in O’s past light cone. Supposing that O-at-t does not cause O’s persistence at t, whatever substance causes O to persist at t must be located in O’s past light cone. Therefore, if the cause of O’s persistence has a location in O’s proper time and we disregard the possibility of retrocausation, the cause of O’s persistence must be located in O’s absolute past.

1343,"The third problem with their response is that (i) the microstructural elements of the chair are _parts_ of the chair, but (ii) the parts of something plausibly cannot efficiently cause (i.e., actualize the existence of) their whole. Here are, briefly, three reasons why this is so. First, if we allow that parts of something can efficiently causally sustain their whole, then sustaining-cause-arguments could only get us to an unsustained, uncomposed component that sustains wholes—not a radically transcendent God who is decidedly _not_ a part of creation. Second, parts of wholes seem in some sense less fundamental than the wholes of which they are parts; plausibly, they’re only intelligible with reference to the substances they compose. Their existence _qua_ the things they are, then, presupposes the (ontologically) prior existence of the substance and hence cannot causally explain its existence. It seems that your arm cannot be the efficient cause of you, since its being _your_ arm in the first place presupposes _your existence_ as a substance. Third, it’s a component of Thomistic-Aristotelianism that parts of substances exist merely _virtually_ (and hence only in potency); but per the Aristotelian causal principle, only things existing in _actuality_ can causally actualize the existence of something else. (Cf. Feser (2014, p. 197) for the point about parts and virtual containment.) And while our final two points in this paragraph depend on Aristotelian views of substances, there is still value in bringing to light incompatibility between McNabb and DeVito’s rejoinder (on the one hand) and such Aristotelian views (on the other hand).

1199,"[35] Here are two further responses. First response: The continuous processes of change are only to the object’s _accidental_ features, and thus only require causes that simply modify the object in various ways. But through such accidental changes, the object’s _essential_ features remain unchanged and intact. And, surely it is _this_ unchangingness that matters for existential inertia, since the object persists so long as its essential properties remain unchanged and intact! Second response: Essentially, I could _grant_ that no- change accounts are inapplicable to objects undergoing the kind of continuous intrinsic change specified by the objection. But this does not undermine EIT, since EIT only applies to temporal concrete objects _or some subset thereof_. Thus, so long as some subset of temporal concrete objects (at the foundational layer of temporal reality, say) do not undergo the kind of continuous intrinsic change that this objection specifies, then no-change accounts of EIT can avoid the objection in question. Whether or not there _are_ such temporal concrete objects is a separate question, of course. But it is significant in its own right if we have a viable metaphysical account of inertial persistence that applies (or would apply) to such objects.",two response first response continuous process change accidental feature thus require cause simply modify object various way accidental change essential feature remain unchanged intact surely unchangingness matter existential inertia since object persists long essential property remain unchanged intact second response essentially could grant no- change account inapplicable object undergoing kind continuous intrinsic change specified objection undermine eit since eit applies temporal concrete object subset thereof thus long subset temporal concrete object foundational layer temporal reality say undergo kind continuous intrinsic change objection specifies no-change account eit avoid objection question whether temporal concrete object separate question course significant right viable metaphysical account inertial persistence applies would apply object,sceptic,1278

1633,"But I don’t find this persuasive. Surely something might endure through time _not_ because it intrinsically changes but instead because it changes in _relation_ to _other_ things that intrinsically change. Even if time is the measure of change, this only implies that the existence of time entails that _there is some change or other_ ; it does _not_ imply that every entity that exists in time must _intrinsically_ change. Temporal reality could be such that (i) objects O1, O2, . . . On exist in time, (ii) one of the aforementioned Oi is intrinsically unchangeable, and (iii) time nevertheless exists (and passes) in virtue of the changes in objects _other than_ Oi (and to which, we can suppose, Oi relationally stands). And, crucially, Feser argues in his article that immutability is, indeed, compatible with extrinsic change. So Feser has failed to establish that immutability entails timelessness, since immutability is compatible with extrinsic change, and an entity can be temporal in virtue of extrinsically changing in relation to other things that intrinsically change. (E.g., a simple particle might be intrinsically changeless and yet nevertheless persist through time in virtue of standing in relations to _other_ things that _do_ intrinsically change.) Now, perhaps Feser will argue that being immutable is only compatible with extrinsically relational changes that _don’t_ temporalize their subjects. Perhaps, but then he owes us an _argument_ for this claim, as well as an account of what distinguishes extrinsic changes that _don’t_ temporalize from those that _do_.",find persuasive surely something might endure time intrinsically change instead change relation thing intrinsically change even time measure change implies existence time entail change imply every entity exists time must intrinsically change temporal reality could object exist time ii one aforementioned oi intrinsically unchangeable iii time nevertheless exists pass virtue change object oi suppose oi relationally stand crucially feser argues article immutability indeed compatible extrinsic change feser failed establish immutability entail timelessness since immutability compatible extrinsic change entity temporal virtue extrinsically changing relation thing intrinsically change eg simple particle might intrinsically changeless yet nevertheless persist time virtue standing relation thing intrinsically change perhaps feser argue immutable compatible extrinsically relational change temporalize subject perhaps owes u argument claim well account distinguishes extrinsic change temporalize,sceptic,1586
1205,"One worry thus far is that the mere fact that a given composite object _presupposes_ the existence and combination of its parts does not entail that it _depends_ (in some causal or metaphysical sense) on those parts.

But this only implies a kind of logical or counterfactual dependence, not an _explanatory_ dependence. (X logically or counterfactually depends on Y just in case had Y not existed, X would not have existed. Explanatory dependence has much more metaphysical ‘oomph’ (as it were) and conveys a causal or non-causal (i.e., grounding) relation between X and Y.

1389,"[12] There are criticisms of something like existential inertia in Kvanvig and McCann (1988). I have not considered them in this post for several reasons, foremost among them being that I’m not convinced that they’re actually criticisms of existential inertia _as such_. Kvanvig and McCann are explicit that they only criticize the thesis that there is some positive ontological item within a temporal substance—a _self-sustaining capacity_ —whose operation ensures or explains or otherwise maintains the persistent existence of the substance. But few if any of the metaphysical accounts of Section 5 require positing a self-sustaining capacity of this sort, and it is certainly not inherent to or required by EIT _as such_. (Beaudoin 2007 also addresses Kvanvig and McCan’s points.) I have also not addressed Feser’s (2011) claim that (at least some of) the five ways themselves represent arguments against EIT. Here are some reasons for this. First: I have already addressed the first way elsewhere, and in the next sub-section I’ll be considering the Aristotelian proof’s demand for a sustaining cause. I will also address what Feser says on behalf of the demand for sustaining causes in his essence- existence or De Ente-esque argument (i.e., his Thomistic proof) as well as what Feser says on behalf of the demand for sustaining causes based on contingency (i.e., his Rationalist proof). What I say therein applies _mutatis mutandis_ to Feser’s claim that the first three ways constitute arguments against EIT, since Feser gives the second and third ways essence-existence and contingency interpretations (respectively). And I don’t find the fourth or fifth ways plausible. Second: I find Feser’s claim deeply implausible, given that the renditions in question of the five ways have premises that—by my lights—simply _assume_ , rather than _justify_ , the falsity of EIT.",criticism something like existential inertia kvanvig mccann considered post several reason foremost among convinced actually criticism existential inertia kvanvig mccann explicit criticize thesis positive ontological item within temporal substance—a self-sustaining capacity —whose operation ensures explains otherwise maintains persistent existence substance metaphysical account section require positing self-sustaining capacity sort certainly inherent required eit beaudoin also address kvanvig point also addressed claim least five way represent argument eit reason first already addressed first way elsewhere next sub-section considering aristotelian demand sustaining cause also address feser say behalf demand sustaining cause essence- existence de ente-esque argument ie thomistic proof well feser say behalf demand sustaining cause based contingency ie rationalist proof say therein applies mutatis mutandis claim first three way constitute argument eit since feser give second third way essence-existence contingency interpretation respectively find fourth fifth way plausible second find claim deeply implausible given rendition question five way premise that—by lights—simply assume rather justify falsity eit,sceptic,1876

Under both classical _and_ non-classical models of God, the unique foundation of reality is a metaphysically necessary, unlimited, axiologically supreme, perfect being upon which everything else depends. But so long as the non-classical theist has principled reason to think that a perfect being exists, they thereby have a principled reason to think that this perfect being’s existence is _uniquely unexplained_. And this is true _regardless_ of whether this perfect being is such that its essence is numerically distinct from its existence, since God’s status as uniquely unexplained simply falls out of his perfect and unlimited nature. It is intuitively obvious that perfection—axiological supremacy and unlimited value—precludes dependence on something else.

Again, friends of Humean Supervenience will say that the truth conditions for counterfactuals or for laws are provided by the distribution of qualities on the fundamental arena and how that distribution covaries across possible worlds. The counterfactual question can then be answered by noting that at the closest possible worlds where O does not persist, O is positively destroyed from without. The regularity question can be answered by noting that in each of the instances where an object ceases to exist, the object was positively destroyed from without. This drives home a lesson for all law-based accounts of inertial persistence and not only those committed to Humean Supervenience: the fact that there is a specific sort of regularity concerning the persistence of objects should be explained in the same way that regularities are explained in general and the fact that objects persist unless specific conditions obtain should be explained in the way that counterfactual facts are explained in general.",friend humean supervenience either question specific collection counterfactual statement truth value eg persists could ceased exist question specific regularity eg persist unless positively destroyed without friend humean supervenience say truth condition counterfactuals law provided distribution quality fundamental arena distribution covaries across possible world counterfactual question answered noting closest possible world persist positively destroyed without regularity question answered noting instance object cease exist object positively destroyed without drive home lesson law-based account inertial persistence committed humean supervenience fact specific sort regularity concerning persistence object explained way regularity explained general fact object persist unless specific condition obtain explained way counterfactual fact explained general,sceptic,1345

EIT only debars a scenario in which every temporal concrete object is sustained or conserved in being from without.

1351,"In any case, my to-be-articulated argument (which simply expounds on the argument in Merricks 2019) doesn’t rest on a quantificational model of existence criticized by pluralists like Vallicella (1983; 2014) and Miller (1992), and nor does it rest on what Kerr (2015, p. 68) calls the Frege- Russell-Quine view of existence. As Merricks (2019) points out, the argument can be run _both_ in terms that employ quantifiers _and_ in terms that don’t. For nearly every argument Merricks gives in his article, there is a formalized, quantificational version but also a version that makes no reference at all to quantifiers. The quantificational apparatus of first-order logic, then, is _not_ after all essential to Merricks’s argument—we need not assume that the quantifiers alone offer an adequate semantics of “exists.” As Merricks writes, the concern of his argument is _metaphysical_ rather than semantic or logical: “For the debate at the heart of this paper is not primarily about such symbols. Rather, that debate is about whether everything enjoys the same way of being, or instead enjoys one or another of two ways of being, or one or another of three, etc.” (2019, p. 593). What’s more, where we _do_ use quantifiers, our usage thereof _only_ assumes that quantification _accurately represents_ existence. Our usage assumes _none_ of the following: that quantification _fully_ represents existence; that quantification captures _everything_ that needs to be captured in analyzing existence; that quantification _explains_ similarity or difference in ways of being; that existence is (or ought to be) _analyzed in terms of_ quantification; that existence or being _just is_ (or _just means_ ) quantification or being the value of a bound variable (as Quine 1948 put it) — e.g., if existence is (primarily) a first-order property, then quantification over objects may very well _accurately track_ just those objects that enjoy existence as a first- order property; that existence is not a property things have (or that existence is a second-order property); that existence is reducible to or synonymous with instantiation; and so on. In short, even if quantification elides important facts about existence, this is entirely compatible with quantification _accurately representing_ existence, just as scientific abstraction—while eliding important features of the modeled phenomena—can nevertheless accurately represent said phenomena. (Thus, _assuming_ (as we (and Merricks) argue we shouldn’t) that the to-be-articulated argument is essentially tied to quantification, one way to circumvent the argument is to affirm that quantification _doesn’t_ accurately represent existence. But, first, the argument is still significant for those who affirm as much, since the argument would then establish the philosophically significant _conditional_ claim that _if_ quantification accurately represents existence, _then_ the Aristotelian proof assumes the problematic thesis of ontological pluralism. Second, if the proponent of the Aristotelian proof (or ontological pluralism) wishes to take this line of response, they owe us some way to accurately represent existence. (And if no such way is forthcoming, this is plausibly a mark against their view vis-à-vis views that _are_ able to accurately represent existence.)

Nothing’s existence can pull itself up by its own metaphysical bootstraps; nothing’s existence can metaphysically explain _why there is that very existence_ to begin with.

So, that makes every attempt to use logic to argue for God completely futile.""      I have not ""admitted"" anything.      An infinite random sequence such as I have described is just a limited model of simplicity that is also, in some sense, about something that is not known or accessible, or understood by someone. Applied to my free will, it would not mean that my free will choices are not ordered to anything. It means, assuming its validity, that whatever process I use to arrive at a decision is beyond your ability to know, understand, or predict, using whatever measurement or calculation you care to try.      I don't use logic to argue for the existence of God, at least not logic alone. I use observation. I open my eyes and see what God has made as in Romans 1:20. The logic part starts with an assumption: ""There must be a simple unifying cause of all of creation"". What we know as ""science"" cannot fill the role of logic in the argument. Science is not remotely simple, but is highly complex. The simpler explanation, we call God. It is, in fact, a definition.      ""If, given a finite amount of time, I will arrive at a point when death ends the process, then it is simply a matter of random chance.""      No, my free will choice is random to you, not to me. You cannot understand how I choose or predict what I will choose, but that does not make my choice disordered. It just means that you cannot understand or predict it. You do not just ""happen"" to be a theist or an atheist when you die. Your intellectual part, private as described (the reason for modelling it as random), directs your free will (it can still deliberately choose wrongly), but such a deliberate wrong choice turns you from God, where you will stay if you die in refusal. Your knowledge of the love of God plays a role in the choice, but you freely make it.      ""it seems that God has waited just long enough for the first time Adam did something wrong to condemn him""      God did not condemn Adam or anyone else.      ""since he was the one who put the sequence there in the first place, He knew exactly what was going to happen and when it was going to happen""      The sequence is just a model of unpredictable simplicity. It is not an ordering of creation.      ""Adam, just like the rest of us, was always doomed and has always been in need of redemption.

But in such a scenario, both (i) and (ii) of Schmid’s EIT are satisfied: (i) O persists without _requiring_ sustenance (though it is _in fact_ continuously sustained), and (ii) O ceases only if caused to cease (by a withdrawal of God’s sustaining activity, say). Thus, assuming that absences can serve as causes, Schmid’s EIT renders the following conjunction possible: (i) nothing inertially persists (i.e., every temporal concrete object is continuously conserved or sustained in being), and yet (ii) EIT is true.

Rising in the morning, coffee-drinking, writing, reading lectures, dining, walking, everything had its appointed time, and the neighbors knew that it was exactly half-past three o'clock when Kant stepped forth from his house in his grey, tight-fitting coat, with his Spanish cane in his hand, and betook himself to the little linden avenue called after him to this day the ""Philosopher's Walk."" Summer and winter he walked up and down it eight times, and when the weather was dull or heavy clouds prognosticated rain, the townspeople beheld his servant, the old Lampe, trudging anxiously behind Kant with a big umbrella under his arm, like an image of Providence.      What a strange contrast did this man's outward life present to his destructive, world-annihilating thoughts! In sooth, had the citizens of Königsberg had the least presentiment of the full significance of his ideas, they would have felt far more awful dread at the presence of this man than at the sight of an executioner, who can but kill the body.

The reason is that the very notion is incoherent. Positive causal destruction implies that the non-existence of a concrete object O is the effect of — brought about by — some cause. However, ‘non-existence’ cannot be an effect. Effects must exist in order to stand in the causal relations they do.

Arguably, although form and matter may interdepend with respect to the beginning of a substance’s existence (i.e., with respect to the origination of the form-matter composition), it does not follow that they thereby interdepend at every moment at which they exist. This is because—for all Feser has shown—there may very well be a conditional potency within each that accounts for why, when combined with the other, they are able to manifest some further ‘feature’ (namely, a tendency to persist).[8] Consider again the case of the chemical species. The first species will not manifest redness unless the second is present, while the second will not manifest redness unless the first is present. But all this demands is an explanation for why they combined in the first place, since that original composition is what actualized the conditional potencies to transition into a state of actuality.

1179,"Does this account accrue a theoretical cost by ending in a primitive or unexplained necessity? It’s not clear that it does. The proposition for which we seek an explanation is that temporal concrete objects persist. Let this proposition be _p_. Now, the chain of explanations of _p_ is either finite or infinite. If it’s infinite, then it’s unclear that we actually have an adequate explanation of _p_ , after all. If _p_ obtains in virtue of _q 1_, and _q 1_ obtains in virtue of _q 2_, and so on _ad infinitum_ , it seems that we have simply infinitely _deferred_ an adequate explanation of _p_.

In that case, the chain ends in something that is _not further explained_ —that is, it ends in something primitive.[17] In that case, though, it is surely no mark against Schmid’s propositional necessity account that _it_ , too, ends in something primitive, since _every_ explanation of _p_ —if the aforementioned reasoning holds—must likewise end in something primitive.[18]",account accrue theoretical cost ending primitive unexplained necessity clear proposition seek explanation temporal concrete object persist let proposition p chain explanation p either finite infinite infinite unclear actually adequate explanation p p obtains virtue q q obtains virtue q ad infinitum seems simply infinitely deferred adequate explanation p kind infinite dependence regress many eye vicious suppose chain explanation p finite case chain end something explained —that end something primitive case though surely mark propositional necessity account end something primitive since every explanation p —if aforementioned reasoning holds—must likewise end something primitive,sceptic,1115

579,"@ Walter Van den Acker,      The little logic puzzles that you are setting are tricks that you are playing on yourself.      ""If logic is contingent, so is God, because the proposition 'God exists' is, in that case, a contingent truth.""      Contingent logic and contingent truth are not the same thing. Logic is a procedure that, properly used, takes us from one truth to another. Contingent truth is not absolute truth. ""It takes an hour to swim across the lake"", depends on the lake, the person swimming, and other contingent factors. God knows all the contingencies. They are in the infinite sequence which is contingent to us, but not to God, who is absolute truth. Furthermore, the infinite sequence is an _image_ of God, a Divine Idea, meaning that God knows it. But an image of God is not God any more than the pixels in your digital photo of a tree are the tree. You cannot say that the tree does not have sap because the photo does not have sap. Similarly, you cannot say that God is contingent from the entertainment of an image of God. The image does not show what God is, but it shows what you cannot say that God is not. Because people, made in the image of God, can be stupid does not imply that God is stupid.      God has no procedure of using logic. God knows the procedure of logic that you use. He created it. That procedure, properly used, is whatever God wills it to be. Whatever he wills it to be, it still allows humans to reason from one contingent truth to another within the composite contingent truths that humans understand.      ""Your account of free will means that you can turn into an atheist tomorrow and I can turn into a theist, because that happens to be an unbiased bit of both our 'wills.'

Since—per CP—every potential that is actualized requires something already actual to cause this actualization, and since the only plausible way to cause the relevant change to the predicate(s) is to cause O to cease to exist (i.e., to positively destroy O), we can infer the truth of EIT just as before.",third seems plausible infer eit employing notion ‘ cambridge use refers change predicate satisfied without corresponding gain loss property whether intrinsic extrinsic property particular focus predicate ‘ ‘ consider change extension predicate cease exist case potential first extension empty becomes actual else potential second extension everything becomes actual since—per cp—every potential actualized requires something already actual cause actualization since plausible way cause relevant change predicate cause cease exist ie positively destroy infer truth eit,sceptic,942

1481,"[17] One might think that the terminus of the chain of explanations—while not explained by any _further_ proposition—is nevertheless _self-explanatory_. I have two responses. First, I find it plausible that nothing can explain or account for why it _itself_ is true (or obtains, or exists) at all. For in order to have any explanatory power in the first place, it would ‘already’ (as it were) have to be true (obtain, exist). (‘Already’ expresses not temporal but ontological priority.) Plausibly, one cannot merely _presuppose_ the very thing for which one sought illumination. (Also, just imagine: if I ask why _q_ is true, it’s no use responding ‘because _q_ is true’. Surely, I say, this explains nothing!) But suppose I’m wrong about the impossibility of self- explanation. Suppose, in other words, that some propositions can explain their own truth. Presumably, this will involve the proposition having a kind of ‘intrinsic intelligibility’—once the proposition is grasped, there is no mystery concerning why it is true. This brings us to my second response: plausibly, _no_ explanation of persistence will be self-explanatory—in which case, each explanation of persistence will end in an unexplained primitive. And in that case, the fact that Schmid’s propositional necessity account ends in an unexplained primitive is not a mark against it as an explanation of persistence. Consider explanations of persistence that deny EIT. Such explanations either adduce one or more _atemporal_ concrete objects that sustain temporal objects or else an infinitely descending chain of more fundamental temporal concrete objects sustaining or conserving less fundamental temporal concrete objects (of which the former aren’t parts).

631,"“ Psalm 50:11: I know all the birds of the mountains; And the wild beasts of the field are mine.”      Where suffering of animals is as part of nature, we must trust that to God. Life could not have evolved without suffering, and we must trust that the rich tapestry of dark and light is perfectly rounded in the end. “All is well” as He told Julian of Norwich. This is just faith in God’s goodness, and I have confidence that the great suffering of animals in nature will make be a necessary part of a perfect plan when we see things as they are.      Where it’s caused by humans, we are responsible. We each are called to play our part in reducing the suffering of others, as far as we are able. I can’t judge a poor person who overworks a donkey to build a house, or buys factory farmed meat, but those who can afford to support better welfare and always choose the cheapest/cruelest must be at least partly responsible for the cruelty.      It’s similar with children. We can’t see God’s full plan, but we know that life is short for all of us next to eternity. We can only play our part in reducing it where we can, and trust the rest to God.      As Augustine alludes to, some who have suffered the most can become the purest, most loving people you could meet. Others become hard and cruel. God is refining us like “silver in the furnace”. If we go with the process as he asks us to, and most of the saints actually welcome suffering in themselves, we have good reason to believe that it’s to our benefit in the long run. Most difficult of course is when it’s others suffering, especially those we love. But it’s exactly the same in that we can do what we can to help (including righteous anger in the very rare cases where that is the right response), but must do all we can to avoid becoming hard and cruel ourselves in response. Difficult as it may be, we must trust. We must try to see that what is sharp and apparently meaningless in the moment, is very different from the widest perspective.

1367,"[34] Furthermore, if the external sustainer is God (classical conceived), an immediate problem for the proposal that there is an event of God’s withdrawal of sustenance from O. For under classical theism, anything distinct from God is created and sustained by God (Rogers (1996, p. 167), Bergmann and Brower (2006, p. 361), Grant (2019, ch. 1), and Kerr (2019, pp. 15 and 44)). (And God, after all, is surely not identical to a _withdrawal_!) But surely whatever x that God creates and sustains is such that God is free to withdraw his sustaining activity of x. So, God could withdraw his sustaining power from the relevant event.

While I understand the standard response to that to be something along the lines of ""necessity justified in view of the perfection of creation,"" I'm wondering if there is not a richer answer hidden in the back of our tradition. Specificly, I'm wondering about the role of angels in all this.      Think of something like Tolkien's cosmology - physical evil and disorder entered into creation when the principalities and powers of the world (The Valar and Maiar) entered into conflict with each other, one desiring to fullfill the creators plan to make a habitation for the ""children of illuvitar"" (rational life), and others, out to make a dominion for themselves. As proper ""sub-creators,"" God, in his secondary causality, had given spiritual beings the duties of care and creation in the physical world, and the flaws, imperfections, and downright violence of creation were due to the infidelity of some of the powers intrusted to their care. If we hold the standard line that fallen angels fell in the first instant of their creation, and, further, that they had been, nevertheless, been given dominion over certain parts or aspects of creation, then Johanine language about the ""lord of this world,"" and Pauline language about the ""princes of the powers of the air,"" makes a lot more sense, and can even be joined to an evolutionary cosmology.      The universe is an odd place, and the creation of the conditions for life, let alone rational life, in an odd, (physically fallen?) cosmos could be seen as the fruit of angelic conquest over malign forces. Furthermore, evolution itself might be seen as being helped along or guided by forces trying to bring about God's will in creation.

Perhaps one of them has an essence included in which is the essential attribute of being trinitarian (or omnipotent, or omniscient, or impassible), whereas the other has an essence included in which is the essential attribute of being unitarian (or quasi-omnipotent, or quasi- omniscient, or diff-impassible—cf. my footnote 7). In this case, each being is identical to its own essence (and, we can suppose, its own existence, in which case each being is a being of pure esse), and yet there is no single essence that the beings share in common.",gel mistaken saying “ f could essential property since case b would exhibit f well ” illicitly assumes b share essence essential property nowhere gel justify argument show could two being pure esse identical unshared essence need suppose share one essence may simply different essence perhaps one essence included essential attribute trinitarian omnipotent omniscient impassible whereas essence included essential attribute unitarian quasi-omnipotent quasi- omniscient diff-impassible—cf footnote case identical essence suppose existence case pure esse yet single essence being share common,sceptic,1036

The argument, for instance, requires a constituent ontology on which features of a thing _compose_ it (and, in particular, on which the metaphysical principle of _esse_ (existence) is a _constituent part_ of the substance). It also requires (i) realism about essences, (ii) realism about _esse_ or existence, and (iii) a view of existence as a first-order property had primarily by substances (rather than (say) a second-order property (i.e., a property of properties) or not a property at all).

So in saying that _rectangularity_ and _circularity_ are not indiscernible—i.e., that they are discernible—Gel seems to be saying that there _are_ further individuating properties in virtue of which _rectangularity_ and _circularity_ are distinct. But then he’s contradicting his earlier claim in the passage that the explanation for their distinction is _not_ something else. Now, this apparent contradiction gives us reason to think Gel is _not_ using “indiscernibility” in the aforementioned sense.

520,"@Talmid: My condition for the “necessary” is ‘in order to achieve God’s plan’. We can of course only see that very dimly indeed, but it’s clear that the “new heaven and earth” will be more like the creation that people who reject God because of theodicy issues would expect of a good God. No more working in vain, no more pain of witnessing your children's misfortune. The wolf and the lamb eat together, even the lion no longer eats other creatures. So it seems clear to me from revelation that these things are a necessary phase of creation. When God creates he says it’s “good”, even though He knew it would contain elements that would not be part of the second creation. Once we were consciously able to choose between Him and not-Him, we often chose the latter. However it’s in making this choice correctly when it’s not obvious or easy that we ‘grow up’, as in we become as our Father intended.      Now I agree with you that we can imagine universes where we would be free and where we could easily see what is right, where there is no suffering of us or others to make us ‘loose heart’, and where there are no bright and shiny false lights with temporary excitement and pleasure. However, like the vines planted in good, loamy soil, which produce great big bunches of grapes but poor wine, there is clearly a need for us to struggle a bit in an apparently sub optimal environment for the creation process to have a successful end point. How God knows that, we cannot know. Did He tune creation like a quantum experiment, with all possible realities happening, and from eternity selected the one that worked best? Or did He just know, because He is infinite and absolute in all things? I suspect the latter, but the point is that we see a very small part of the creation process. The people who have the most issue with it nearly always think the process is complete, and that is their downfall.",talmid condition “ necessary ” ‘ order achieve course see dimly indeed clear “ new heaven earth ” like creation people reject god theodicy issue would expect good god working vain pain witnessing misfortune wolf lamb eat together even lion longer eats creature seems clear revelation thing necessary phase creation god creates say “ good ” even though knew would contain element would part second creation consciously able choose not-him often chose latter however making choice correctly obvious easy ‘ grow become father intended agree imagine universe would free could easily see right suffering u others make u ‘ loose bright shiny false light temporary excitement pleasure however like vine planted good loamy soil produce great big bunch grape poor wine clearly need u struggle bit apparently sub optimal environment creation process successful end point god know know tune creation like quantum experiment possible reality happening eternity selected one worked best know infinite absolute thing suspect latter point see small part creation process people issue nearly always think process complete downfall,theist,1902

In fact, Beaudoin’s tendency-disposition account merely cited the _absence_ of a tendency to expire in conjunction with the non-exercise of potentially destructive powers. Similarly, transtemporal accounts like the Transtemporal Explanans adduced earlier do not postulate a property or power of a substance that explains its persistence. Instead, what explains persistence is transtemporal explanatory (e.g., causal) connections that relate the successive phases of objects’ lives. Law-based accounts cite laws of nature, and many such accounts do not treat laws as properties or powers of substances. Clearly neither objectual nor propositional necessity accounts treat inertial persistence as a property or power of substances.

1194,"Hume famously argued that there are no relations of necessary connection between distinct existences. That is, in instances where we have the expectation that, given the occurrence of an F, an instance of a G will follow, we have the expectation because our minds have formed an association between instances of Fs and instances of Gs and not because there is any necessity linking Fs to Gs. (Or so goes the standard interpretation of Hume provided in undergraduate classes; addressing whether this is the correct interpretation of Hume is beyond the scope of this post.) David Lewis developed a metaphysical system — that we will call _Humean Supervenience_ — according to which all that ultimately exists are (1) a collection of space- time points and (2) an assignment of qualities to space-time points. Everything else supervenes on the distribution of qualities. Lewis’s program takes inspiration from Hume in that there are no necessary relations between distinct existences, that is, between distinct space-time regions. Causation, laws, and chance are all to be explained in terms of how the distribution of qualities covaries between possible worlds. For example, according to the Best System Account (BSA) of laws, although the distribution of qualities can be _systematized_ or _summarized_ in various ways, the laws are the axioms of the system that captures the best trade off between simplicity and generality.",hume famously argued relation necessary connection distinct existence instance expectation given occurrence f instance g follow expectation mind formed association instance f instance g necessity linking f g go standard interpretation hume provided undergraduate class addressing whether correct interpretation hume beyond scope post david lewis developed metaphysical system — call humean supervenience — according ultimately exists collection space- time point assignment quality space-time point everything else supervenes distribution quality program take inspiration hume necessary relation distinct existence distinct space-time region causation law chance explained term distribution quality covaries possible world example according best system account bsa law although distribution quality systematized summarized various way law axiom system capture best trade simplicity generality,sceptic,1424

This is pretty straightfoward here: the soul is stuck with the body limitations and so its natural capacities will be worser on a crappier body.      Take now the cartesian view were the soul is a substance whose nature is other than the body but is made to function with the body. Here the sould and the body must function together to it to work well, so a bad body will make the soul less capable of functioning.      Now take the thomistic view were the soul is the form of the body. Here things also work well, for the body is responsable for sense data, memory and imagination and the intellect(that the soul is responsable for) needs sense data everytime it needs to function*, so if the body do not work well, them the sould is screwed.

But this is simply untrue.

Merely from the fact that existence is neither an essential nor non-essential feature of S, it doesn’t follow that existence is an _activity_ of S. (For instance: perhaps there is simply _no such thing as_ _existence_ —perhaps, in other words, there is no positive ontological item that is _existence_.) Second, the exact same reasoning Hsiao and Sanders employ against existence’s being a property or a non-essential feature of S equally applies to their claim that existence is an activity of S. For in order for S to _act_ in a given way—to perform some activity like walking, say—S must _already_ exist. Something must first _exist_ in order to engage in various activities (i.e., in order to act, in order to have activity). Non-existent things, after all, surely don’t act or engage in activities. Thus, existence cannot be an activity of S. This reasoning, by our lights, is exactly parallel to the reasoning Hsiao and Sanders use to dismiss existence’s being a property and a non-essential feature (respectively).",make two point response first seems inference activity non-sequitur merely fact existence neither essential non-essential feature follow existence activity instance perhaps simply thing existence —perhaps word positive ontological item existence second exact reasoning hsiao sander employ property non-essential feature equally applies claim existence activity order act given way—to perform activity like walking say—s must already exist something must first exist order engage various activity ie order act order activity non-existent thing surely act engage activity thus existence activity reasoning light exactly parallel reasoning hsiao sander use dismiss property non-essential feature respectively,sceptic,1140

1009,"Why do I say P(F|CTST) << 1? Consider that for an object to persist for about 116 days is for it to persist approximately 10,000,000 seconds. And consider that there are about 1044 Planck times in one second, and hence to persist for about 116 days is to persist for about 1051 Planck times. Now, for each (possible) Plank time in an object’s life, God is free to sustain the object for that Planck time or refrain from so sustaining it, and this is true even if God has sustained the object through previous Planck times. (It’s not as though God suddenly becomes forced or compelled to continue sustaining an object, and it’s not as though some moral obligation is newly imposed on him, or whatever. These are unacceptable by the classical theist’s lights.) This entails that for a given world w in which an object persists for (at least) 116 days and is then causally destroyed by something, there are about 1051 worlds in which that object ceases to exist at some point earlier than w due to God’s withdrawal of sustenance. Moreover, under classical theism, God remains utterly invariant across all worlds, and hence there is no difference or variance on God’s end to which one could point in _any_ such world to explain why **_it_** came about as opposed to some **_other_** world. Thus, conditional on CTST, the expectation that w obtains—that is, that the single world in which the object persists for 116 days (upon which it is finally causally destroyed) obtains rather than any of the other 1051 worlds—is very small. And hence the data of F, as applied to this 116-day-lived object, is very unlikely conditional on CTST, whereas its probability is 1 conditional on EIT. And hence EIT garners very strong evidential confirmation from F vis-à- vis CTST.

In short, if ‘∃’ expresses the disjunction ‘∃a or ∃p’, then ‘~∃x(~Fx)’ expresses ‘~(∃ax(~F) or ∃px(~F))’ , which is equivalent to ‘~∃ax(~F) and ~∃px(~F)’, which in turn—given interdefinability—is equivalent to ‘∀ax(Fx) and ∀px(Fx)’. And since ‘~∃x(~Fx)’ is equivalent to ‘∀x(Fx)’, it would follow that ‘∀’ would express ‘∀a and ∀p’.

1725,"There are at least two problems with this argument for uniqueness. For starters, merely from the fact that God’s essence is not something that can be shared with anything else, it doesn’t follow that there cannot be more than one God. For all the argument shows, it could be that there are two Gods, _each of which is identical to its own unshared essence and existence_. We need not suppose that they _share one and the same essence_ ; they may simply have _different divine essences_. Perhaps one of them has a divine essence included in which is the essential attribute of _being trinitarian_ , whereas the other has a divine essence included in which is the essential attribute of _being unitarian_ , whereas a third has a divine essence included in which is the essential attribute of _being binitarian_. In this case, each God is identical to its own essence (and, we can suppose, its own existence), and yet there is no single essence that all the Gods share in common. Now, you might object that for each of them to be _Gods_ , they must at least minimally all share _some_ essential attribute, such as _divinity_ or _omnipotence_. But why? Why not instead suppose that they each simply have their own (e.g.) _trope_ of _divinity_ or _omnipotence_? Or why not take a nominalist approach to Gods, such that there are no such things as divine properties that any such God possesses (and, _a fortiori_ , no properties they could share in common)? Or perhaps each God only possesses omniscience, omnipotence, divinity, etc. _analogously_ to the rest, such that we block the need for features that they share in common but nevertheless preserve a _kind_ of common (albeit merely analogous) predication among them.

1386,"Merricks proceeds through different ways of modifying, supplementing, or replacing (26) in order to state pluralism. But none of them, argues Merricks, succeed. For instance, one might add to (26) the claim that something a-exists and something p-exists. But this modification still fails to state act-potency pluralism, since a pluralist who accepts a-exisence, p-existence, _and another_ particular form of existence—someone we might call an act-potency- plus pluralist—also accepts the modified thesis. Hence, someone who denies act-potency pluralism would accept the modified thesis, in which case it fails to state pluralism. Alternatively, one might add to (26) that there are exactly two ways of being. But stating that there are exactly two ways of being ultimately requires a truly universal quantification: there is _this_ way of being, that _other_ way of being, _and these are all the ways of being there are_.

You answer ""not necessarily"" for, from what i remember, you reject the ur- platonist view that being and goodness are the same, so your criteria of what a good thing is probably(i can only supose) tied to happiness in a way that unhappiness in a large level is not the type of thing that should be desirable at all.      By contrast, someone like Aquinas would argue that even beings so fragile are desirable for their existence allow for a major variety of good things and even their decay and corruption is in a sense, and only in a sense, desirable for the corruption of one material thing aways result in other things(even if not usually living) and so ad variety.      Remember that later pagans and ancient and medieval christians took effort to argue against the gnostic view that the material world is bad because of the inevitable corruption and decay its existence creates, which seems alive on today antinatalists, so the view i'am defending does argue that even beings that can and do suffer and die are good.

For the microstructure of the chair is a _component_ of the chair, and only ‘actualizes’ the chair in the sense that something ‘depends’ (in some sense) on its components. But upon tracing _this_ causal chain of ‘dependence’ down to a first member, all we’re entitled to infer about such a member is that it is an _uncomposed component_ , not an unactualized actualizer of the very being or existence of the things in question. McNabb and DeVito have not pointed to something _outside_ the composite object as an actualizer of its very being; instead, they’ve merely sent us off on a regress of more fundamental component _parts_ of something on which that thing ‘depends’ (in the sense of whole-to-part dependence).

559,"Walter      “ No, suffering is not a necessary part of our creation unless your claim is that the fall was necessary.   The point of the Fall is that man and not God is responsible for the Fall, but nobody can be responsible for a necessary truth. that would be like saying you are responsible for why 1 + 1 = 2.”      Again, I think this is treating spiritual truth a bit like Newton’s laws of motion. The fall is a spiritual fall, it’s when spiritual death first appeared. Death can be seen as disintegration, but the modern, protestant, literalist mind always assumes this to be physical. Do you really think no creatures died before Adam and Eve ate the fruit?      Remember also that Lucifer fell from heaven before Adams fall. There is a far larger canvas here than just Adam and Eve eating something. Creating free, rational beings seems to inevitably result in at least some of them failing in terms if pride, and therefore obedience. If it’s not inevitable, it’s at least the case in Gods perfect plan for creation.      I do however also think that the fall was necessary at some point. We are each created unique. Some of us are like the prodigal son, and some more like his brother. There are lessons the Father wants both types to learn as part of the process of our creation that is this life. Without the ‘fall’ of the prodigal son, there is no opportunity for either brother to make the right choice to align with the father. Just as the creation of our bodies was via a process of ongoing refinement through suffering, our reconciliation with God is a partaking in the redemptive suffering of God as son of man. It’s of course true that man caused our fall. But God’s plan, from a perspective we can’t even imagine yet, is perfect. Nothing has gone wrong. Bizarre as that may seem to us at times in the middle of it, I believe this to be true.

My point here is simply this: any reason for thinking that there could be differentiating features among _divine persons_ consistent with their being pure esse _also_ seems to be a reason for thinking there could be differentiating features among _beings_ consistent with their being pure esse. Or, equivalently: any reason for thinking there couldn’t be differentiating features among _beings_ of pure esse _also_ seems to be a reason for thinking there couldn’t be differentiating features among _divine persons_ of pure esse.

As we saw earlier, vicious explanatory circularity entails that x causes or grounds y while y causes or grounds x. This is impossible regardless of whether there is some z that accounts for both x and y, since the very fact of the vicious circularity entails that x is both prior and posterior to y, which is a contradiction. If hylemorphism entails that two distinct things are viciously intertwined—such that the existence of each explains the existence of the other—then that would simply be a _reductio_ of hylemorphism. Far from demonstrating the need of an extrinsic sustaining cause for any composite object, Feser’s step four imputes a metaphysical impossibility to composite objects _from the get-go_. And if Feser holds instead that x only causes or explains y in some respect distinct from the respect in which y causes or explains x (in order to avoid contradiction), then his argument no longer has teeth. For then there is _no_ vicious circularity, and hence the very means by which he motivated the need for an extrinsic source of _both_ x and y is undercut.",second even granting commitment vicious explanatory circle metaphysically impossible regardless whether extrinsic cause accounting viciously intertwined thing saw earlier vicious explanatory circularity entail x cause ground cause ground x impossible regardless whether z account x since fact vicious circularity entail x prior posterior contradiction hylemorphism entail two distinct thing viciously intertwined—such existence explains existence other—then would simply reductio hylemorphism far demonstrating need extrinsic sustaining cause composite object step four imputes metaphysical impossibility composite object get-go feser hold instead x cause explains respect distinct respect cause explains x order avoid contradiction argument longer teeth vicious circularity hence mean motivated need extrinsic source x undercut,sceptic,1271

And in that case, the explicability motivation for IoI—which seeks to _avoid_ primitive individuation altogether—is mistaken. Now, in response to _this_ point, Gel suggests restricting IoI to substances. Setting aside the seemingly _ad hoc_ nature of this restriction, my criticism still stands in another guise: namely, it provides an _undercutting defeater_ for the explicability- based motivation for the restricted IoI. Once we grant that there is primitive individuation (even among properties), we seem to lose any compelling explicability-based reason for thinking that primitive individuation among substances is impossible. (What’s the relevant difference between substances and properties in virtue of which the former, but not the latter, cannot be primitively individuated? For me, no answer presents itself upon reflection.)

As we’ve discussed, orthodox interpretations of relativity entail that objective simultaneity does not exist. Friends of simultaneous causation would be right to point out that they use the term ‘simultaneous’ differently from how that term is deployed by physicists (or even as ‘simultaneous’ has been deployed in much of this post). For physicists, to say that two numerically distinct space-time points _p 1_ and _p 2_ are simultaneous is just to say that _p 1_ and _p 2_ occur at numerically the same absolute time, that is, that _p 1_ and _p 2_ are instantaneous. Friends of simultaneous causation should not be interpreted as endorsing the view that causes are instantaneous with their effects. For that reason, simultaneous causation cannot be ruled out merely on the grounds that relativity rules out objective instantaneity. However, friends of simultaneous causation move too quickly if they conclude that simultaneous causation runs into no problems at all from relativity. The trouble is that the failure of objective instantaneity makes objective concurrence much more difficult to understand.

But his possession of being cannot be caused by the principles of his nature, e.g. his _forma substantialis_ [i.e., substantial form] ( _a_ ). The possession of _esse_ is the absolutely prior condition of the possibility of the causal and explanatory efficacy of these principles of nature. The nature must _first_ exist if it is to do or cause anything at all. _Esse_ is prior to the substance, which means that it is prior to the composite of _forma substantialis_ and _materia prima_ [i.e., prime matter]. But the concern here is to understand how it is that Pat Metheny possesses existence in the first place. It follows therefore that he must receive his existence from something else ( _b_ ) in which there is no distinction between essence and existence.

One can render perdurance or endurance consistent with the empirical adequacy of relativity by either (i) replacing perdurance or endurance with appropriate relativistic analogues, (ii) replacing relativity with an empirically equivalent theory that includes relations of objective simultaneity, or (iii) introducing additional structure into relativistic space-times in virtue of which one can define objective simultaneity relations.

One might retort that x’s existence is _continuously_ distinct from x’s essence, in which case x is _continuously_ non-existent by default. But the inertialist attracted to the tendency-disposition account in question can make two replies. First, the inertialist can reject that continuous-non- existence-by-default follows from continuous-distinction-between-essence-and- existence, _precisely because_ things enjoy a natural tendency to persist. For if things enjoy such a tendency, then while they may be non-existent by default, they will _persist_ by default even if their essence and existence are continuously distinct.[6] Second, _even if_ continuously-non-existent-by- default followed from continuous-distinction-between-essence-and-existence, the inertialist can say that that this only implies that if x is to continually _exist_ , there needs to be some _explanation_ for such continuance.

612,"@ Walter Van den Acker,      Original sin was the fall of creation and suffering was the consequence of this fall. We are all in this fallen creation. No one is being ""punished"", not even Adam and Eve. They just inevitably chose sin given free will and time. Human free will can also be modelled by an infinite unbiased random binary sequence so all choices exist in it somewhere (as simple a model as you are likely to find). Adam and Eve, in time, chose to leave temporal paradise and enter the fallen creation. Knowledge of good and evil meant a return to temporal paradise was gone without the intervention of God to bring them to the new creation, the eternal (outside of time) paradise with God.      This is where we are, all of us, people, babies, good people, bad people, dogs, ticks, mosquitos, and viruses. There is only one creation (simplicity again). We are all in it together. God did not cause multiple worlds for each to choose, and by the choice define right and wrong (for you are the one claiming to redefine things, not me). As a human with an infinite component to your mind, since you are free, you can always choose your own way to stay separate from God. In eternity (outside of time), when the new creation replaces this one, choosing will no longer be possible, so if you have elected to be separate from God, you will stay separate from God.      The world we live in is not so by necessity. It could have been anything (modelled by the random sequence). It could have been a world in which 1+ 1 is 3 and the rules of logic could have been anything. But the world we live in is the way it is because of love. Love, not necessity. Love is why after inevitably (given endless time) exiting temporal paradise, there is still Salvation if you freely choose it.

In Newtonian space-time, at each time, the universe is a three-dimensional Euclidean space consisting of a collection of objectively simultaneous spatial points.

In Galilean space-time, the universe, at each time, is again a three-dimensional Euclidean space composed of a collection of objectively simultaneous spatial points. However, absolute rest does not exist in Galilean space-time; for that reason, spatial points do not persist through time, even though material objects may.

Instead, there is little mystery about the conditions under which objects cease to exist: “They cease to exist when and only when forces act upon them” ( _ibid_ ). This is not some brute fact, “any more than if it were the case that all objects ceased to exist when and only when in the vicinity of objects twice their size” ( _ibid_ ). We need some account of why there is such commonality among ceasing to exist. According to Oderberg, this is explained in terms of a tendency to cease to exist, a tendency whose manifestation conditions involve “destruction by the application of forces” ( _ibid_ ). This tendency to cease, moreover, “depends ontologically on the tendency to continue to exist in the absence of those forces. Nothing can cease to exist in certain conditions unless it already continues to exist prior to those conditions” ( _ibid_ ).

Causes do not temporally precede but are _simultaneous_ with their effects, or so the worry goes.[13] Imagine, for instance, that a foot has (from eternity past) been impressing upon some sand. We are supposed to have the intuition that the imprint in the sand is caused by the foot’s pushing down on the sand. But the latter does not temporally precede the former. There is simply a relation of concurrent dependence. The reader should note that the objection from the simultaneity of causation only works if causes _must_ be simultaneous (or concurrent) with their effects; otherwise, if causes can temporally precede their effects, then defenders of transtemporal accounts can say that temporal objects are the transtemporal cause of their own persistence.",might worry causal transtemporal account violate simultaneity causation cause temporally precede simultaneous effect worry go imagine instance foot eternity past impressing upon sand supposed intuition imprint sand caused pushing sand latter temporally precede former simply relation concurrent dependence reader note objection simultaneity causation work cause must simultaneous concurrent effect otherwise cause temporally precede effect defender transtemporal account say temporal object transtemporal cause persistence,sceptic,852

If absolute time can be reinstated, then the intuitive notion of causes concurring with their effects can be reinstated. For our purposes in this post, we make two observations. First, alternatives to relativity remain deeply controversial. So long as relativistic orthodoxy remains a live option, the possibility that causes do not concur with their effects remains a live option. And, for that reason, transtemporal accounts of existential inertia remain live. Second, the objection concerns alternatives to relativity that are empirically indistinguishable from relativity, at least within some domain. In any case in relativity’s domain of application where we can detect a relationship between a cause and an effect, theories that are empirically indistinguishable from relativity must have the same observational consequences as relativity. Thus, within relativity’s domain of application, insofar as relativity suggests that causes temporally precede their effects, any observationally indistinguishable alternative to relativity will suggest that causes temporally precede their effects.",perhaps friend simultaneous causation could instead object appealing empirically indistinguishable alternative relativity reinstate absolute time absolute time reinstated intuitive notion cause concurring effect reinstated purpose post make two observation first alternative relativity remain deeply controversial long relativistic orthodoxy remains live option possibility cause concur effect remains live option reason transtemporal account existential inertia remain live second objection concern alternative relativity empirically indistinguishable relativity least within domain case domain application detect relationship cause effect theory empirically indistinguishable relativity must observational consequence relativity thus within domain application insofar relativity suggests cause temporally precede effect observationally indistinguishable alternative relativity suggest cause temporally precede effect,sceptic,1261

Anselm is clear on this point. He says that, “whatever is made up of parts is not absolutely one, but in a sense many and other than itself, and it can be broken up either actually or _by the mind_ —all of which things are foreign to” God.[19] Compare a similar statement made by Jacob Arminius in his _25 Public Disputations_ , Disputation IV.XI: “Simplicity is a pre-eminent mode of the Essence of God, by which he is void of all composition, and of component parts whether they belong to the senses or to the understanding.”[20] What this means is that not even conceptual distinctions can apply to the simple God. As Anselm explains, “what either actually or conceptually has parts can be divided into parts, and this is altogether foreign to God.” ( _Incarnation of the Word_ VII). Avicenna concurs that even conceptual distinctions are foreign to the simple God.[21]",previous publication explained classical doctrine divine simplicity say god god identity claim leave room distinction god anselm clear point say “ whatever made part absolutely one sense many broken either actually mind —all thing foreign ” god compare similar statement made jacob arminius public disputation disputation ivxi “ simplicity pre-eminent mode essence god void composition component part whether belong sens understanding ” mean even conceptual distinction apply simple god anselm explains “ either actually conceptually part divided part altogether foreign god ” incarnation word vii avicenna concurs even conceptual distinction foreign simple god,sceptic,1065
544,"I think people sometimes take original sin too much like a theory of physics. Once you do that it can lead to misunderstandings. Perhaps think of it instead as God creating nature with a telos, in fact a hierarchy of teloi, with everything drawn towards his divine idea(l)s (using Augustines terms). What the fall represents is us starting to choose our own sub-teloi, of having “knowledge” of what is “good” for us. Once we do the conscious choosing, we generally do a pretty bad job of it, as can be seen immediately with Cain, and that has consequences that ripple across everything. Like a stone thrown into a calm pond.      In order to recover our correct place in nature so that we can become participants in God’s original creation, working with him rather that towards our own faulty choice of sub-telos, we have to aim towards God’s original idea(l) of man.      Fortunately He has helped us hugely here. The incarnation was not just(!) the sacrifice that gained the reconciliation of the consequences of our bad choices, it also gave us the perfect example of the divine ideal we were created to be. So in choosing to be more like him, as far as we can in our puny efforts, we become participants in God’s great act of creation that is this universe (and we get help in this). On this path even the delights of the world become good, and we can have life to the full (though not without suffering yet).      If we don’t - but rather continue to create our own sub-teloi - then even good intentions can lead us away from completion, away from union with the creator. For those whose chosen teloi, their highest good and highest desires, are the base pleasures of the world, it is them who are choosing eternal torment. We are made to rest in Him, not in base things which will always bring their own suffering.

From the beginning, contrary to what Ed claims, suffering was a problem and hence, from the beginning, there was a a need for theodicies.   God may be good in only an analogous way, but an analogy has something in common with what it is compared to, and your definition of goodness is contrary to what is generally understood by goodness. What is more important is that I think you are a good person and that in everyday life you use the same definition of goodness that I do.   And on that definition of goodness, every possibilty of evil would be ruled out if that were possible. But yiurb definition of god's goodness is simply circular ""Good is what God does and whatever god does is good"".      It is indeed so that the Christian good is not all good in any meaningful sense, not just not in the sense that we are but in no sense at all.   Using people and their suffering as a means to get a more attractive creation is not good in any meaningful sense. It is, in every meaingful sense, appalling.

In principle, it could easily be the case that A’s pure esse _just is_ A’s F-ness, while B’s pure _esse_ _just is_ B’s G-ness, where F-ness isn’t G-ness. This is kinda similar to how, for the classical theist, God’s pure esse _just is_ God’s omnipotence. It’s not as though God is pure esse _plus_ omnipotence; God’s pure esse _just is_ his omnipotence. The same can be said in the case of A and F—it’s not as though A is pure being _plus_ F-ness; A (and A’s pure esse) _just is_ A’s F-ness. And B is differentiated from A by dint of B (and B’s pure esse) being identical to G-ness, which is distinct from F-ness. Here, A and B are discernible: F-ness is a feature A has (and, indeed, is identical to) that B lacks, while G-ness here is a feature B has (and, indeed, is identical to) that A lacks, and such features differentiate them.[7] Furthermore, each of A and B is pure esse.

Even platonists argue that.      Well, the christian does have the example of the saints, whose suffering and hardships make their lifes noble and interesting* not only to us but even to themselves. To a christian, suffering is supposed to be seen not as a crappy thing, but as a way of uniting with Christ and climbing the latter to being similar to Him.

1091,"The first response to this proposal is that their cessation of existence is not the robust kind required by CTST, since the heavy elements do not, along with their parts, instantaneously annihilate. Second, recall that EIT only quantifies over temporal concrete objects _or some subset thereof_. Hence, even if spontaneously decaying particles do not inertially persist, this does nothing to refute EIT. Third, the facts concerning the cessation of existence of such elements are fully consistent with EIT. This is because such quick cessations of existence are not utterly inexplicable (for that would destroy the possibility of their scientific study!). Rather, they are _caused_ to cease to exist, either by their intrinsic nature/character or by environmental conditions unconducive to their perpetuation. But that means such elements are not counterexamples to EIT, since they could easily be such that they persist of their own accord for that short span of time and are interrupted in such persistence by sufficiently destructive internal or external causal factors.",first response proposal cessation existence robust kind required ctst since heavy element along part instantaneously annihilate second recall eit quantifies temporal concrete object subset thereof hence even spontaneously decaying particle inertially persist nothing refute eit third fact concerning cessation existence element fully consistent eit quick cessation existence utterly inexplicable would destroy possibility scientific study rather caused cease exist either intrinsic naturecharacter environmental condition unconducive perpetuation mean element counterexample eit since could easily persist accord short span time interrupted persistence sufficiently destructive internal external causal factor,sceptic,1073

1169,"Why do I say P(F|CTST) << 1? Consider that for an object to persist for about 116 days is for it to persist approximately 10,000,000 seconds. And consider that there are about 1044 Planck times in one second, and hence to persist for about 116 days is to persist for about 1051 Planck times. Now, for each (possible) Plank time in an object’s life, God is free to sustain the object for that Planck time or refrain from so sustaining it, and this is true even if God has sustained the object through previous Planck times. (It’s not as though God suddenly becomes forced or compelled to continue sustaining an object, and it’s not as though some moral obligation is newly imposed on him, or whatever. These are unacceptable by the classical theist’s lights.) This entails that for a given world w in which an object persists for (at least) 116 days and is then causally destroyed by something, there are about 1051 worlds in which that object ceases to exist at some point earlier than w due to God’s withdrawal of sustenance. Moreover, under classical theism, God remains utterly invariant across all worlds, and hence there is no difference or variance on God’s end to which one could point in _any_ such world to explain why **_it_** came about as opposed to some **_other_** world. Thus, conditional on CTST, the expectation that w obtains—that is, that the single world in which the object persists for 116 days (upon which it is finally causally destroyed) obtains rather than any of the other 1051 worlds—is very small. And hence the data of F, as applied to this 116-day-lived object, is very unlikely conditional on CTST, whereas its probability is 1 conditional on EIT. And hence EIT garners very strong evidential confirmation from F vis-à- vis CTST.

As substances possess properties and not vice-versa, substances are distinguished in virtue of the properties inhering within them (or which they’re identical to). It doesn’t seem like we should give up this notion, given how compelling essentialism is. But then how can their properties be distinguished? Some properties can be understood in virtue of more fundamental properties, but unless we opt for infinite regresses instead of foundational grounding, properties will have to bottom out on some level. Can we explain bottom-level properties (which may or may not inhere in fundamental substances a la Aristotle’s four elements) in terms of further properties? No, because they have to bottom out. Can we differentiate them in virtue of the substances which they are or inhere in? No, because we’re invoking properties to differentiate substances in the first place. The bottom-level properties are just primitively differentiated while the bottom-level substances in which they inhere are differentiated *in virtue of those primitively individuated properties.* So even though these bottom- level properties are primitively-individuated, it does not follow that the same is true of the substances which they are identical to or inhere in.

645,"Walter      This awe and fear of being in God’s presence is not something he inspires, it’s His infinite greatness perceived by a finite creature. It’s the shock of reality unveiled. From behind the veil, at times He spills over such that we can experience a diluted form of His presence where words like gentle, tender, love, peace etc are used. For now we only see dimly, our perception is naturally tuned to dim reality, and so it’s in this diluted form that most of us can distinguish anything other than infinite ‘brightness’.      In general you take a position that conflicts with everything revealed in scripture. So where do you get your information on what God is, what God could do and couldn’t do?

This is made clearer by the three temptations that Jesus was given in the desert. Satan did not ask for worship, as he is more sly than that. He presented different versions of this human perspective, which relate to suffering, power, and image (being liked or admired). Satan even quotes scripture, the master theologian using scripture to sell the human perspective.      This is what spiritual discernment is all about.

To argue about God’s choices is therefore meaningless unless he revealed something about it.      When I use necessary here, I mean it purely in that it seems necessary in order to achieve God’s plan, which is at least in part to create children who choose to be as like Him, and can therefore participate with Him in the Trinity. That is an astounding thing, a top down view of the telos of the universe.

Following Gilmore (2008), we can define a binary locational predicate ‘is weakly located at’. For O to be weakly located at a space-time region R is for O to spatiotemporally overlap R, that is, for R to not be completely free of O. As Gilmore defines it, R is O’s _path_ just in case R “has a subregion in common with all and only those regions at which the object is weakly located” (2008, p. 1228). Or, as Calosi and Fano describe, “the path of an object is simply the union of its exact locations” (2015, p. 287). For the perdurantist, O’s path will turn out to be the space-time region occupied by O’s space-time worm, whereas for the endurantist, O’s path will turn out to be the mereological sum of all the space-time regions that O occupies throughout O’s life.",order introduce relativistic conception endurance perdurance need first place conceptual machinery table following gilmore define binary locational predicate ‘ weakly located weakly located space-time region r spatiotemporally overlap r r completely free gilmore defines r path case r “ subregion common region object weakly located ” p calosi fano describe “ path object simply union exact location ” p perdurantist path turn space-time region occupied space-time worm whereas endurantist path turn mereological sum space-time region occupies throughout life,sceptic,908

For instance, perhaps the neo-classical theistic God’s essence simply _requires_ existence, or perhaps unlimited perfection requires existence. And the legitimacy of this form of explanation seems eminently plausible. Consider the really distinct properties[18] ‘being triangular’ and ‘being trilateral’. Why are these co- instantiated? Because they are simply the _kinds_ of properties that _require_ co-instantiation. This seems to be a perfectly legitimate explanation of their compresence or unity in something. It does seem somewhat odd to demand some sort of concurrent sustaining cause keeping the two properties together. And this plausibly generalizes to a being whose parts are all the _kinds_ of things that _require_ their unity and co-instantiation.

In response, we note that it’s true that on some theories of color, these will be efficient rather than material causes. But, first, Feser is fundamentally concerned not with the properties of things but instead with the existence of things like the chair.

A surface is _achronal_ just in case any two numerically distinct points on the surface are space-like related to each other (for a formal definition, see Calosi and Fano 2015, p. 287). Here, we use the term ‘surface’ in a fairly general way; an achronal surface can be a three-dimensional slice of the space-time block. In fact, achronal surfaces are, in some sense, the relativistic analogue of the three-dimensional spaces located at distinct times that are included in Newtonian and Galilean space- times.

In the temporal paradise nothing would end it except a voluntary exit (freely choosing to turn away from the presence of God). So an infinitude of time was available, unmarred by fear, aging, or death.      Now let us look at the simple model of human free will in time (in the temporal paradise) - an infinite sequence of unbiased bits, in which lies all possible intelligible choices encoded one way or other (you, Walter, can choose any encoding method subject to finite computation).      To be unbiased, the infinite sequence would have to contain, as a subsequence, the choice to turn away from God (exit paradise). If the infinite sequence did not contain the choice as a subsequence, the infinite sequence would not be an unbiased random sequence and it would not be simple but would be complex.      So the free choice to turn from God, given endless time, is inevitable.      ""I suppose that makes sense to someone who treats logic (and God) as contingent.""

It’s of course a very difficult thing, and the argument is not in any way whatsoever that we should just ignore suffering in others, to be indifferent to it. Quite the opposite, doing the small bit we can to help those suffering in their different ways is part of what we are asked to do. This is why I describe it as a necessary part of our complete creation, and not as a good in itself. Of course us normal Catholics don’t envy the suffering in others. However those who have the deepest relationship with God do often become keen to suffer themselves, so that they can ‘take up their cross’ and share in the sacrifice of God incarnate.

688,"Splendid! Finally an actual argument.      Let’s recap: your initial claim is that the logical problem of evil provides good philosophical reasons not to believe in the God of classical theism because it shows there is no way to reconcile the bad things that happen to people with “Omni” attributes we want to affirm about God.      A response to this claim was then given that one possible “out” that can preserve these divine attributes by hypothesizing that God could make restitution to the wronged parties in the next life.      You then made a bunch of irrelevant remarks about how everyone who disagrees with you on this topic is stupid, and most people probably gave up on the conversation. But now we actually have a non-trivial and non-circular response! An immortal soul cannot exist that survives after death because we don’t know how a soul interacts with the brain, so it is therefore impossible for God to offer restitution to a person after death.      Now that we have that all our of the way, ready for the philosophy? You sure? Ok here it is:      I reject your premise. An unsolved question is not a demonstration that two concepts are incompatible.      This is further justified by the arguments that Dr. Feser has made here (and others have made elsewhere) that the mind cannot be wholly materially determinate, and that there must be an immaterial component to our thoughts (which is positive evidence for the soul).

1033,"Because the argument requires that God have an _esse_ or act of existence different from creaturely acts of existence. Under such a view, God and creatures _exist in different ways_. For suppose that God’s existence was the same existence as creatures’ existence. Since God is identical to his existence, it would follow that creatures’ existence _just is_ God. But this is absurd for several reasons. First, with ordinary objects like “stones, trees, dogs, human beings, and the like… there is in each of them a real distinction between its essence and its existence” (Feser 2017, p. 122). The distinction is _in_ objects, i.e., it is _within_ them or _intrinsic_ to them. (At least, that’s how _I_ read the passage.) If I read the passage right, then essence and existence are _component parts_ of ordinary objects. But God is obviously not a component part of things. Second, “there is no such thing in mind-independent reality as a thing’s essence existing apart from its existence (whatever that would mean) or a thing’s existence existing apart from its essence (whatever that would mean)” (2017, p. 123). But if a thing’s existence is identical to God, then clearly a thing’s existence can exist apart from its essence, since God can exist apart from anything else (had he chosen to refrain from creating). Third, the argument says (or requires, or entails, or whatever) that the existence of creatures must be caused by something outside it—something which adds existence to its essence, as it were. Thus, if God were identical to ordinary objects’ existence, then God would be caused. But God is not caused. For these three reasons, it follows that creatures’ existence is not identical to God (and hence God’s existence). And as we’ve seen, this entails pluralism about being. Hence, the De Ente argument requires pluralism about being: God and creatures exist in different ways. God’s existence is not the same existence as creaturely existence.",argument requires god esse act existence different creaturely act existence view god creature exist different way suppose existence existence existence since god identical existence would follow existence god absurd several reason first ordinary object like “ stone tree dog human being like… real distinction essence existence ” feser p distinction object ie within intrinsic least read passage read passage right essence existence component part ordinary object god obviously component part thing second “ thing mind-independent reality essence existing apart existence whatever would mean existence existing apart essence whatever would mean ” p existence identical god clearly existence exist apart essence since god exist apart anything else chosen refrain creating third argument say requires entail whatever existence creature must caused something outside it—something add existence essence thus god identical ordinary existence god would caused god caused three reason follows existence identical god hence existence seen entail pluralism hence de ente argument requires pluralism god creature exist different way existence existence creaturely existence,sceptic,1956

But, first, this claim is simply flatly asserted. Second—and more importantly—the claim is straightforwardly _false_. For there are _other ways_ to secure God’s uniqueness wholly apart from DDS. Nearly all models of God affirm that God is perfect. In contemporary philosophy of religion, a _perfect being_ is understood as a being that possesses all perfections essentially and lacks all imperfections essentially (Bernstein 2014). But here’s something that seems like an obvious perfection: being the source of every concrete thing apart from oneself (i.e., being that on which all other concreta depend for their existence).[30] But this perfection entails uniqueness. For suppose that there could be two concrete beings, x and y, each of which enjoys this perfection. Then y would depend for its existence on x, and x would depend for its existence on y. But this is a vicious circle of dependence, which is impossible. Hence, there cannot be two concrete beings with this perfection. Hence, there can only be one perfect being in principle.

1023,"Things in which essence and _esse_ are distinct do not have existence in virtue of what they are, since prior to their having existence they are nothing; rather, they have it from without, i.e. extrinsically.

We’ve already canvassed some reasons (e.g., plausibly, appealing to past things to explain present things is often both legitimate and indispensable). Schmid offers (what can naturally be interpreted as) an argument from diachronic identity. In particular, Schmid is concerned with “adequately accounting for the distinction between instantaneous replacement and genuine persistence” (2021, p. 215). Schmid argues that transtemporal causal relations plausibly provide necessary conditions for adequately distinguishing “between a successive series of numerically distinct but qualitatively similar simulacra (on the one hand) and genuine persistence (on the other)” ( _ibid_ ). According to Schmid, relevant causal continuity among the stages of an object’s life—where “the later existence of the object at least partly causally or explanatorily depends on the earlier state(s) and existence of the object”—is a necessary condition and partial ground of diachronic identity ( _ibid_ ).

602,"Hi Ed,      You write:      As Augustine says, there isn’t “any evil [that] happens to the faithful and godly which cannot be turned to profit,” so that, with St. Paul, “we know that all things work together for good to them that love God” (Romans 8:28).      I have to say that Augustine's remark sounds very Pollyanna-ish. There are some evils which can only be described as soul-breaking, rather than soul- making. Three which come to mind are rape, mutilation and torture. These are horrendous sufferings which serve no ""greater good,"" and which can destroy even a good individual's faith, as the following account of the 17th century ""torture in the pit"" illustrates:      https://sspx.org/en/news-events/news/real-life-silences-character      There were priests, many of them good men, who apostasized. What good was served?      You also cite Augustine to support the following claim: ""We cannot achieve happiness in the world to come if we become too attached to the world that is, and suffering is a means of preventing the latter.""      This might explain some of the suffering that befalls adults, but it fails to explain the death and suffering of a child, who has no worldly attachments.      Finally, original sin (or the fall of Adam) is said to be the ultimate explanation for why humans are permitted to suffer and die, rather than enjoying immortality and bliss. I am not persuaded that a dumb choice by a distant ancestor makes it fair for us to be allowed to suffer soul-breaking evils of the sort described above, but let that pass. What original sin cannot explain is the fact that people (e.g. political prisoners, psychiatric patients) have been beaten or tortured to death, while screaming for Divine deliverance or at least some Divine consolation (i.e. a sense of ""I am with you"") at the moment of death, and in many cases, it never arrives: they die in agony and desolation. Spiritual abandonment at the hour of death is the most difficult evil of all to make sense of, and if you can make any sense of it, Ed, you're a better man than I.      For my part, I think it's best to honestly acknowledge that some evil in this world is indeed gratuitous and senseless, and that there are some dark recesses of the human psyche which God Himself cannot reach: He can console us while we're in pain, but not while we're in agony, as that severs the communication channels.

1024,"Although a foot causing an impression in some sand from eternity past is a common example of a cause that does not precede its effect, we do not find the example convincing. According to accounts on which causes are substances that produce their effects, why think that the foot must have _produced_ the impression in the sand? Consider, for example, a situation in which there already existed an impression in some sand and, at some subsequent time, a foot exactly matching the impression comes to rest in the impression. Although one could argue that some cause needs to be posited to explain the shape of the impression or to explain why the impression exactly matches the foot, the foot would not be posited as the mediate cause of the impression. We can consider moving the time that the foot comes to rest in the impression arbitrarily far into the past. Points at positive or negative infinity are not standardly included on the real line. Therefore, when we move the event of the foot coming to rest in the impression infinitely far into the past, we remove that event from the timeline altogether. Since, by construction, the production of the impression occurred prior to the foot coming to rest in the impression, we would also have removed the production of the impression from the timeline. There would be no event involving the creation of the impression. So, where some have argued that the foot is the eternal cause of the impression, we can instead imagine that the foot and impression have simply co-existed for all eternity without positing that one is the cause of the other.[14] Whatever one might make of this argument, we think that there is a deeper reason to deny simultaneous causation.",although foot causing impression sand eternity past common example cause precede effect find example convincing according account cause substance produce effect think foot must produced impression sand consider example situation already existed impression sand subsequent time foot exactly matching impression come rest impression although one could argue cause need posited explain shape impression explain impression exactly match foot foot would posited mediate cause impression consider moving time foot come rest impression arbitrarily far past point positive negative infinity standardly included real line therefore move event foot coming rest impression infinitely far past remove event timeline altogether since construction production impression occurred prior foot coming rest impression would also removed production impression timeline would event involving creation impression argued foot eternal cause impression instead imagine foot impression simply co-existed eternity without positing one cause whatever one might make argument think deeper reason deny simultaneous causation,sceptic,1712

No—at least, not if the ‘dependence’ in question is mere linear or per accidens dependence. For Feser nowhere argues that regresses of linear or per accidens dependence must have a first member. Rather, he only argues that _hierarchical_ or _per se_ chains of dependence must have a primary or first member.

This, of course, doesn’t rule out a necessary intellect that actualizes such an object; but the onus is not on _me_ , in the present context, to positively show that this is _false_ ; the onus is on the one _positively claiming_ that composition entails passive potency to show that _any composite_ —including such an abstract object at the bottom level of the abstract grounding hierarchy—has passive potency. “But doesn’t Feser do precisely that in his Augustinian proof?”, you ask. “Well,” I respond, “for starters, he only argues that abstracta exist as divine ideas.

I propose to take a less ambitious argument, which I call the Sensible Argument, and use it to present The Puzzle. I argue that there is a huge puzzle here, about the radical dissonance between the beliefs and practices of many of the purportedly religious. There are, I will argue, good reasons to doubt, concerning many (clearly not all or indeed most) purported religious believers, whether they are indeed believers, or at least whether their beliefs are strong; and religion seems to greatly increase the risks of deception, duplicity, and hypocrisy, as well as self-deception and inauthenticity. By turning towards a religious form of life, one will therefore be adding great morality-related risks. Arguably, if there is a God who deeply cares about individual moral behaviour, he would punish religious moral transgressors more than the secular ones. One is unlikely to be saved from hell (or other severe divine punishment) by becoming religious.

1108,"While friends of Humean Supervenience would say that the classical theist’s standard of metaphysical explanation is alien to their project and is, at any rate, inappropriate, there is another account of laws for which the classical theist’s objection cannot be applied. That is, there are anti-Humean accounts of laws, according to which there _are_ necessary connections between distinct existences. Anti-Humean accounts of laws are united not only by their denial of Humean Supervenience, but also by the modal status that they assign to laws. Lewis held to the free recombination principle. The free recombination principle is a principle about how the space of metaphysically possible worlds can be formally constructed. Roughly, Lewis held that, given two numerically distinct possible worlds W1 and W2, a third world W3 can be generated by conjoining space-time regions from W1 and W2. (Caveats need to be deployed about the two regions having, e.g., geometrically and topologically compatible boundaries.) If, contrary to Lewis, we accept that there are necessary connections between distinct existences, then the necessary connections will constrain both the space of metaphysically possible worlds (e.g., perhaps, given the nature of fire, there is no possible world where fire exists and fire fails to burn) and the relations between worlds (e.g., given the elevated status that laws enjoy on anti-Humean accounts, nearby possible worlds will be those where the laws are satisfied).",friend humean supervenience would say classical standard metaphysical explanation alien project rate inappropriate another account law classical objection applied anti-humean account law according necessary connection distinct existence anti-humean account law united denial humean supervenience also modal status assign law lewis held free recombination principle free recombination principle principle space metaphysically possible world formally constructed roughly lewis held given two numerically distinct possible world w w third world w generated conjoining space-time region w w caveat need deployed two region eg geometrically topologically compatible boundary contrary lewis accept necessary connection distinct existence necessary connection constrain space metaphysically possible world eg perhaps given nature fire possible world fire exists fire fails burn relation world eg given elevated status law enjoy anti-humean account nearby possible world law satisfied,sceptic,1492

This question seems to voice the conviction that there is not a way of being that potency and act alike enjoy. But this conviction, of course, contradicts the thesis that act and potency alike generically exist. Those who share the conviction should therefore reject generic existence. “But”, writes Merricks concerning abstract/concrete ways of being (which applies equally to actual/potential ways of being), “this conviction is the best motivation for pluralism. So this new version of pluralism [i.e., one that embraces generic existence] contradicts the best motivation for pluralism” (2019, p. 602).

532,"Vincent, why some people are in anguish and despair when tortured, while others find themselves in the same state although enjoying all the pleasures the earth has to offer, is the drama that is human life. It's well-known that many early Christians gave up the faith when threatened with persecution but this doesn't detract from the greatness of the sacrifice of so many others. If one cannot put up a coherent case against the Christian understanding of suffering, original sin and Redemption, it does not do much good to think forever and gloomily about suffering. The effort would be better spent thinking about heaven.      Evil is not ""natural"" or part of the divine plan. Men deprived of the benefits of original justice are not in a merely natural state, according to St. Thomas:      (Ia IIae 109): ""We may speak of man in two ways: first, in the state of perfect nature [state of nature]; secondly, in the state of corrupted nature. Now in the state of perfect nature, man, without habitual grace, could avoid sinning either mortally or venially; since to sin is nothing else than to stray from what is according to our nature - and in the state of perfect nature man could avoid this...

1254,"Now, as Jeffrey Brower notes, the idea that either Aquinas or Aristotle should be interpreted as having offered a view in terms of restricted existential quantification would be “hopelessly anachronistic” (Brower 2014, p. 54). To be sure, Aristotle (1933) did hold that being is said in many ways ( _Metaphysics_ IV.2 and VII.1), and so Aristotle should be understood as a pluralist. But the logical machinery of existential quantification (at least as presently understood) did not yet exist at the time when either Aquinas or Aristotle were writing. Nonetheless, Feser and other current friends of the Aristotelian proof _do_ have access to the full logical machinery of existential quantification. Furthermore, when Gottlob Frege and other logicians invented existential quantification, they were modeling a phenomenon that appears in natural language, that is, one and the same linguistic phenomenon that Aquinas and Aristotle were utilizing when they discussed being. Brower (2014, p. 51–54) provides three reasons for thinking that we ought to interpret Aquinas and Aristotle as pluralists and that their views can fruitfully be interpreted in terms of restricted existential quantification. First, restricted existential quantification can help us make sense of both Aquinas’s notion that there are modes of being and can help us make sense of the analogy of being. Second, restricted existential quantification can help to clarify, articulate, and answer interpretational questions that arise about Aquinas’s notion that there are distinct modes of being. Third, restricted existential quantification can help us interpret Aquinas’s discussion of the ultimate categories of being, including the total number of ways of being (Brower 2014, p. 52). (Brower counts fourteen fundamental ways of being in Aquinas’s ontology.) We can also identify another set of reasons that (neo-)Aristotelian or (neo-)Thomistic metaphysics should be understood as involving pluralism—namely, that present-day attempts to render Aristotelian metaphysics defensible have understood Aristotelian “ways of being” explicitly in terms of restricted existential quantification (see, e.g., McDaniel (2009; 2010a; 2010b; 2017) and Turner (2010; 2012; 2021).)",jeffrey brower note idea either aquinas aristotle interpreted offered view term restricted existential quantification would “ hopelessly anachronistic ” brower p sure aristotle hold said many way metaphysics iv vii aristotle understood pluralist logical machinery existential quantification least presently understood yet exist time either aquinas aristotle writing nonetheless feser current friend aristotelian proof access full logical machinery existential quantification furthermore gottlob frege logician invented existential quantification modeling phenomenon appears natural language one linguistic phenomenon aquinas aristotle utilizing discussed brower p – provides three reason thinking ought interpret aquinas aristotle pluralist view fruitfully interpreted term restricted existential quantification first restricted existential quantification help u make sense notion mode help u make sense analogy second restricted existential quantification help clarify articulate answer interpretational question arise notion distinct mode third restricted existential quantification help u interpret discussion ultimate category including total number way brower p brower count fourteen fundamental way ontology also identify another set reason neo-aristotelian neo-thomistic metaphysics understood involving pluralism—namely present-day attempt render aristotelian metaphysics defensible understood aristotelian “ way ” explicitly term restricted existential quantification see eg mcdaniel b turner,sceptic,2237

(This shows, moreover, that such a spatial location is not even essential to the cup.)

Indeed, the opposite seems to be the case: we have good reason to think that no such continuously concurrent sustenance is required in order for the cup to simply retain its spatial position.

Your reply has been that existence is worth it and that the way God did it led eventually to my own existence.      But that is only true if we assume that the only alternative is your view of what happened or my non-existence.      My suggestion is not my non-existence as being preferable but rather that your view of what happened is incorrect because it is implausible.,rodrigues thanks think talking little bit though question logic christian theodicy example god create satan knew devil would lead rebellion horrific consequence reply existence worth way god led eventually existence true assume alternative view happened non-existence suggestion non-existence preferable rather view happened incorrect implausible,theist,637
1279,"A similar question arises with respect to concrete objects’ persistence. Why do objects, once in existence, persist in existence instead of being instantly annihilated or annihilated at random, arbitrary points during their existence? If one affixes a necessity operator in front of the EIT, EIT provides a simple answer: objects persist rather than succumb to instant or random annihilation because it is metaphysically necessary that they do so (absent causally destructive factors). (Even if one doesn’t so affix a necessity operator, certain metaphysical accounts (e.g., objectual and propositional necessity accounts) themselves provide metaphysical necessity as an explanatory avenue.) This answer, analogous to the one concerning existence _simpliciter_ , nicely explains why objects persist rather than chaotically being annihilated: the latter is simply metaphysically impossible.",similar question arises respect concrete persistence object existence persist existence instead instantly annihilated annihilated random arbitrary point existence one affix necessity operator front eit eit provides simple answer object persist rather succumb instant random annihilation metaphysically necessary absent causally destructive factor even one affix necessity operator certain metaphysical account eg objectual propositional necessity account provide metaphysical necessity explanatory avenue answer analogous one concerning existence simpliciter nicely explains object persist rather chaotically annihilated latter simply metaphysically impossible,sceptic,889

545,"""If the tree of life was necessary for Adam and Eve to live forever, one might reasonably ask, did animals have access to the tree of life? The answer seems to be no.      If the tree of life was unique, it might have been enough for Adam and Eve to eat from, but it would never have been enough for all of the animals of the world to eat from. This may be another sign that the animals were not understood to have the tree of life for their food. If so, then the text of Genesis itself would suggest that, while man was meant to be immortal, animals were not. That would support the idea, based on St. Paul’s statement, that it was human death that entered the world through the Fall, not animal death.      Furthermore, we should note that giving “every green plant” to animals as food does not mean that some of them weren’t also carnivores. It’s not as if, before original sin, lions ate dandelions and toadstools and only afterward did they begin picking on poor old wildebeest. This is something Thomas Aquinas wrote about in his Summa Theologica:      In the opinion of some, those animals which now are fierce and kill others, would, in that state, have been tame, not only in regard to man, but also in regard to other animals. But this is quite unreasonable. For the nature of animals was not changed by man’s sin, as if those whose nature now it is to devour the flesh of others, would then have lived on herbs, as the lion and falcon.
