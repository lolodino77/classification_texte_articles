Academics do dispute the view that the thing-itself is a separate thing from phenomena, the two-worlds interpretation, but i do feel like it gets close to Kant intend. Specially if one see things like his defense of free will.      About a way of making this view sound coherent, Schopenhauer did a good job of deriving some conclusions about the thing-itself.

But what bothers me about this particular subject is that there has been an absolutely, positively *insane* advancement in the ease of education in the past couple of decades. In less than a single lifetime we went from books almost exclusively being available on dead trees to having copies of massive libraries able to fit in our pockets. And not just books, but videos, interactive instructions, and more. We are swimming in a disgusting abundance of free and accessible education which can be accessed for next to nothing, at will, 24/7, anywhere on the planet. Education has never been easier and more attainable than ever before for everyone in the world. Especially for English speakers.      Somehow, despite this being abundant and obvious, we still are pretending that the only way to (say) learn French is to go six figures in debt and get a French degree from an accredited university that has a massive staff.

101,"N.b. I am the Anon that wrote the above post responding to @Infinite Growth (I had selected ""Anonymous"" by accident from the drop down).      To make clear what I meant by recent politics, take, for example, Act H.R.1226 and Senate Act S.447 through which certain organizations, with the aid of the US government, are trying to extract massive sums of money from the Polish state for so-called heirless property that once belonged to Jews. According to both Polish law and the general legal principle followed virtually everywhere, property without a legal heir reverts to the state after the death of its owner. If a legal heir exists, he is free to pursue restitution like everyone else through the Polish courts. The absurd position of certain groups is that the Polish government should treat these cases in a extraordinary way and offer broad restitution anyway, not to any heirs, because of course they don't exist, but to organizations and people who are not legal heirs. And recall that this was property held by Polish citizens as Polish Jews were Polish citizens. By reinforcing the notion that Poles, as a corporate body, are guilty of collaborating in the criminal program of the Nazis, it becomes easier to make claims on the Polish state. Heirless property, combined with a sprinkle of customary special pleading, misrepresentation, and the thought- diffusing VIP pass that is the word ""Holocaust"", provides a convenient opportunity for unscrupulous organizations to illegitimately extract billions of dollars from the Polish state by exploiting the emotional force of a historical tragedy. Perhaps such organizations should instead direct their claims to Berlin as the German state is responsible for handling the restitution of Jewish property lost through actions of the Nazi regime. As I mentioned already, the Poles have not received a dime of restitution for the absolute obliteration of their country, its cities, its cultural heritage, not to mention the torture, exploitation, and deaths of millions of its citizens, Jew and gentile alike.",nb anon wrote post responding infinite growth selected anonymous accident drop make clear meant recent politics take example act hr senate act certain organization aid u government trying extract massive sum money polish state so-called heirless property belonged jew according polish law general legal principle followed virtually everywhere property without legal heir reverts state death owner legal heir exists free pursue restitution like everyone else polish court absurd position certain group polish government treat case extraordinary way offer broad restitution anyway heir course exist organization people legal heir recall property held polish citizen polish jew polish citizen reinforcing notion pole corporate body guilty collaborating criminal program nazi becomes easier make claim polish state heirless property combined sprinkle customary special pleading misrepresentation thought- diffusing vip pas word holocaust provides convenient opportunity unscrupulous organization illegitimately extract billion dollar polish state exploiting emotional force historical tragedy perhaps organization instead direct claim berlin german state responsible handling restitution jewish property lost action nazi regime mentioned already pole received dime restitution absolute obliteration country city cultural heritage mention torture exploitation death million citizen jew gentile alike,,2062,1

46,"@Infinite Growth      What do ""stripped of all its properties"" means? Even if you take away all of a being visible characteristics there would still be the potentials, the thing being a composite of essence and existence, the thing having started to be etc, so perhaps 2 is false.      Besides, I'am against conceivability arguments in general. Aunt May sure can conceive of a Spiderman that is not Peter Parker, this is what she does, but he is still the Spider. But this is the less important point, for the argument is not the normal conceivability argument.      On top of that, our cognition starts by a thing characteristics, we only know the substance latter, and we classify things according to the characteristics it has, so it is should not suprise us that we cant conceive of it with no characteristics.      I mean, a human is a rational animal, the essence is separated by its characteristics. The diference between one essence and another is the essencial characteristics any has, so it is no wonder that we cant diferentiate one from another once we take the essencial characteristics away.      So perhaps 1 is false, for it is probably the case that even on a substance view of the self we should expect 2 to be true.

Except here, no rich people need to shave any money off their bank accounts. And hasn't it failed? And wasn't it just a lazy way of pretending to solve what is essentially a cultural problem? (Recent African immigrants, by contrast, do very well, academically and professionally, even after our previous American schools teach them that, despite what their lying eyes tell them, they are, in fact, oppressed, that there's no sense in denying it, and the only way out of the invisible cage is through rage and self-pity.)

And it's not going to be the super-rich paying either.      If the concern is to provide education as cheaply and freely as possible, maybe we should consider price caps on tuition. The fact is, with the modern internet, we are capable of providing a massive amount of education for dirt cheap compared to what traditional, outdated institutions currently offer. In fact, we already do so: see Coursera, or all kinds of other online options.

I'll bite, though this is a digression as my point was to show that even much more tangible claims toward restitution remain unaddressed if we wish to talk restitution.      Were there Poles who committed crimes during WWII, who went along with Nazi, or Soviet, crimes? Obviously. I feel silly even having to state the obvious because this is something that follows not from empirical fact, but from the general proposition that the moral status of the actions of individuals during wartime does not conform strictly to the divide of the front line. There were righteous Germans and righteous Russians and wicked Poles. So what? Judas betrayed Christ, but the Apostles on the whole or as a corporate body were not agents of the Sanhedrin. We can say the same about Jews who betrayed both their fellow Jews and committed crimes against gentile Poles, but we rarely talk about those, so why the special pleading here?      As a matter of empirical fact, we must remember things like:      1\. The Polish state never collaborated with the Nazis. Compare that with other European governments. This refusal to collaborate, and the formation of Europe's largest resistance, happened at enormous cost. This, in addition to Nazi crimes against the populace.   2\. Even the number of only those Poles recognized by Yad Vashem outstrips the combined number of people recognized from all other nations combined. Proportion and scale matter.   3\. The penalties for aiding Jews were uniquely and incomparably severe in Poland (involving the execution of the person aiding, his family, maybe neighbors, etc). And yet, point (2).   4\. Poland was home to something like 80% of world Jewry at the time of the war and the majority of the world's Jews for centuries. Any occurrence of antipathy (and don't forget Jewish bigotry, which did exist) at the time of the war was driven by economic, but also cultural, political, social, and historical factors, not racial hatred. That is, there was no impulse to exterminate any group and any crimes committed were isolated incidents of criminal opportunism taken during the chaos of wartime, not systematic programs of liquidation or some broad expression of national hatred. There were also incidents where Poles were forced under threat of death to participate in Nazi operations, incidents that some Jewish authors have grotesquely misrepresented either maliciously or through incompetence (e.g., Jan Gross).

94,"Hi Mister Geocon and Oktavian,      Belief in the Curse of Ham has a long Catholic pedigree. Most of the following quotations are taken from Adiele's book.      Several Church Fathers (e.g. St. Basil of Caesarea, St. John Chrysostom, St. Ambrose, St. Augustine of Hippo) all taught that the human institution of slavery had its origin in Ham's sinfulness. They did not link this to Africa. However, St. Jerome disturbingly refers to ""Ethiopians"" (Kushites) as ""black and cloaked in the filth of sin,"" adding: ""At one time we were Ethiopians in our vices and sins. How so? Because our sins had blackened us.""      Surprisingly, the first text to explicitly link the curse of Ham to Black Africans was the Babylonian Talmud, completed around 600 AD.      In the tenth century, Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria (877-940) was the first Christian Church leader to identify Black Africans as being among those afflicted by the Curse of Ham:      “Cursed be Ham, and may he be servant of his brothers...He himself and his descendants, who are the Egyptians, the Negroes, the Ethiopians, and it is said the   Barbari.”      According to the famous Christian geographical work ""Cursor Mundi"" (1300 A.D.), Noah's son Shem and his descendants were freemen who dwelt in Asia. Japhet and his descendants were nobles and knights who came to live in Europe, while ""Ham, the accursed"" and his descendants were slaves who were sent to Africa.      In the 15th century, the famous Portuguese chronicler Gomes Eannes de Azurara (1410-1474) appealed to the writings of a 12th century archbishop of Toledo, Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada (1170-1247) to support his contention that Black Africans were doomed to servitude because they were the accursed descendants of Ham:      ""The servitude of non-Muslim Moors (West Africans) resulted from the curse, which,   after the Deluge, Noah laid upon his son Ham, cursing him in this way: 'that his race   should be subject to all the other races of the world. And from his race these Blacks are descended,' as wrote the Archbishop Don Roderick of Toledo and Josephus in his Book on the Antiquities of the Jews, and Walter, with other authors who have spoken of the generations of Noah from the time of his going out of the Ark.""      In the 15th century, Dominican Friar Johannes Annius of Viterbo (1432-1502) wrote that the curse of Ham forced him into exile in Africa: “As a result of his sin, Ham is exiled to Africa.”      In the 18th century, French biblical scholar and Benedictine abbot Augustine Calmet (1672-1757) wrote in a work titled “Dictionary of the Holy Bible” (1722): “Noah assigned to Ham the nations of Africa. The occasion of the color of his sons was that Noah being one day asleep discovered his nakedness, and Ham passed that way without covering him; on which accounts his descendants are born with black complexion, and the gift of the prophecy was taken from them.”      In the 19th century, John England, the first Catholic bishop of Charleston, USA, wrote in a letter to US Secretary of State John Forsyth (1780-1841) that the enslavement of Black Africans was entirely lawful, because of the sin committed by their ancestor, Ham:      “Since every Catholic must accept Adam's fall as an essential ingredient in the human condition, he should likewise believe that it certainly was not then against the divine law for Shem and Japheth to use the services of the Black race, since their progenitor had been cursed by God for his sinful conduct.”      Finally, Pope Pius IX issued a Prayer for the Conversion of Africa through the Office of the Sacred Congregation of Rites on October 2, 1873, in which he declared: ""“Let us pray for the most wretched Ethiopians in Central Africa, that Almighty God may at length remove the curse of Cham from their hearts, and grant them the blessing to be found only in Jesus Christ, our God and Lord."" This prayer came with a 300-day indulgence.      Is it ""kind of bonkers"" to say that the Curse of Ham was a major influence on Catholic thought? I think not.",hi mister geocon oktavian belief curse ham long catholic pedigree following quotation taken book several church father eg st basil caesarea st john chrysostom st ambrose st augustine hippo taught human institution slavery origin sinfulness link africa however st jerome disturbingly refers ethiopian kushites black cloaked filth sin adding one time ethiopian vice sin sin blackened u surprisingly first text explicitly link curse ham black african babylonian talmud completed around ad tenth century patriarch eutychius alexandria - first christian church leader identify black african among afflicted curse ham “ cursed ham may servant brothershe descendant egyptian negro ethiopian said barbari ” according famous christian geographical work cursor mundi ad son shem descendant freeman dwelt asia japhet descendant noble knight came live europe ham accursed descendant slave sent africa th century famous portuguese chronicler gomes eannes de azurara - appealed writing th century archbishop toledo rodrigo jiménez de rada - support contention black african doomed servitude accursed descendant ham servitude non-muslim moor west african resulted curse deluge noah laid upon son ham cursing way race subject race world race black descended wrote archbishop roderick toledo josephus book antiquity jew walter author spoken generation noah time going ark th century dominican friar johannes annius viterbo - wrote curse ham forced exile africa “ result sin ham exiled africa ” th century french biblical scholar benedictine abbot augustine calmet - wrote work titled “ dictionary holy bible ” “ noah assigned ham nation africa occasion color son noah one day asleep discovered nakedness ham passed way without covering account descendant born black complexion gift prophecy taken ” th century john england first catholic bishop charleston usa wrote letter u secretary state john forsyth - enslavement black african entirely lawful sin committed ancestor ham “ since every catholic must accept fall essential ingredient human condition likewise believe certainly divine law shem japheth use service black race since progenitor cursed god sinful conduct ” finally pope pius ix issued prayer conversion africa office sacred congregation rite october declared “ let u pray wretched ethiopian central africa almighty god may length remove curse cham heart grant blessing found jesus christ god lord prayer came -day indulgence kind bonkers say curse ham major influence catholic thought think,,4040,1

88,"@Phil Tanny, I can appreciate the desire to avoid getting mired in perpetual kvetching, but it is untrue that unless I can provide an alternative solution, I have no right to dismiss or reject an idea.      I also disagree with the problem statement and the premise that the solution involves some kind of massive payout by the so-called 1%. First, a wealth disparity between racial groups is not per se a problem to be solved. Second, if it is a problem, it isn't necessarily the result of any kind of racism in any tangible sense. It could be cultural, and I claim that the problem is largely cultural (for example, Thomas Sowell, for example, opines that the disintegration of the black family beginning in the 1960s, often assisted by well-meaning social programs, has had a devastating effect on black Americans; I would also mention ideologies of perpetual powerlessness and victimhood that both demoralize and divert energy away from constructive activity toward ineffectual grievance and blame). Third, even if it were racist, I don't see what the rich have to do with it unless you can show that they employ racist policies specifically to impoverish certain racial groups (the targeting of the rich under the pretext that they benefit from a rigged system is the kind of sloppy and unjust rationalization I would expect from a Marxist who foments class conflict). Fourth, throwing money at problems is precisely what (per Sowell) created much of the problems we're seeing today. NGOs, often run by wealthy philanthropists, offer a relevant example of how funneling money and free goods into causes can cause more damage than it solves (the destruction of the Nigerian cotton and textile industry through mitumba, the destruction of Haitian farming through free rice given long after a crisis has passed, even something like the effect of TOMS on African shoe manufacturing and repair).

20,"Kant, by contrast, tied his critique of traditional metaphysics to an essentially positive and optimistic view of what reason could accomplish. True, he did not think reason could penetrate into the natures of things as they are in themselves. Since that’s what traditional metaphysics claimed to do, and natural theology is grounded in such metaphysics, his position entails a critique of traditional metaphysics and natural theology. However, in Kant’s view this entailed no doubts about the rational foundations of morality or of science (which concerns the world as it appears to us rather than as it is in itself). A consistent Humean has to put natural theology, natural science, and ethics in the same boat. A consistent Kantian can leave natural theology in the boat by itself.",kant contrast tied critique traditional metaphysics essentially positive optimistic view reason could accomplish true think reason could penetrate nature thing since traditional metaphysics claimed natural theology grounded metaphysics position entail critique traditional metaphysics natural theology however view entailed doubt rational foundation morality science concern world appears u rather consistent humean put natural theology natural science ethic boat consistent kantian leave natural theology boat,,785,1
73,"Kant was one of the world's greatest thinkers. He phillosophy foresaw quantum mechanics.      Kant did not view things-in-themselves as containing the sum of all possibilities, and phenomena all actualities; but this duality is conformable to Kant's metaphysics as to none other. As a contribution to the metaphysics of possibility, the quantum mechanical wave function can easily be seen as complementary to Kant's idea of things-in-themselves, where various kinds of things can happen (like free will) that are not comprehensible in terms of phenomenal reality. Kant would just have to allow that characteristics of physical reality can intrude some depth into things-in-themselves, which he would not have considered -- though we can also handle this by positing an intermediate level of reality, between true unconditioned things-in-themselves and true discrete phenomenal objects -- as Kant otherwise actually does himself for space and time as ""pure intuitions."" The wave function straddles the classic Kantian boundary, sharing some properties with phenomena, others, as underlying phenomena, with things-in-themselves.      Thus, where Kant would have considered all of phenomena governed by determinism, we now see the wave function as deterministic, while the collapse of waves into particles is random. Although chance in quantum mechanics has often been argued as allowing for free will, a free cause is still a very different thing from a random cause, which doesn't need mind or self or intention. Moral freedom is thus still left among things-in-themselves. Kant himself would have had difficulty placing randomness in his ontology, if he, like Hume, believed that chance violates determinism. Since chance is now part of the physics, it cannot be denied; but it also still remains a different matter from purposive freedom.      Kant's idea that space and time do not exist among things-in-themselves has been curiously affirmed by Relativity and quantum mechanics. In Relativity, time simply ceases to pass at the velocity of light: for photons that have travelled to us as part of the Cosmic Background Radiation, time has stood still for most of the history of the universe. On the other hand, quantum mechanics now posits ""non-locality,"" i.e. physical distances, and so the limitation of the velocity of light in Relativity, don't seem to exist. This means that although time may apply to the wave function, space may not. The full empirical reality of space is only found among discrete particles and objects.      This curious result is the consequence of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Paradox, which was intended by Einstein as a reductio ad absurdum of quantum mechanics. If, for instance, a positron and an election are both created from an energetic photon, the conservation of angular momentum requires that one be spinning one way, and the other the other. But the complementary spins are equally probable for each particle. Thus, in quantum mechanical terms, the wave functions of each particle divide without a discrete state being determined. The particles might then separate to even cosmological distances, but as soon as the spin of one particle is observed, the other particle must have the opposite spin, which means that the wave function has collapsed across those cosmological distances and caused the other particle to assume a predictable spin. If this occurs instantaneously, it would violate the limitation of the velocity of light in Special Relativity.      This has now been shown to actually occur on the basis of Bell's Theorem (from John Bell, 1928-1990), meaning that Quantum Mechanics does violate Special Relativity by allowing instantaneous interactions across even cosmological distances. However, once observed, processes must still obey Special Relativity and the limitations of spatial distance, creating the kind of duality described by Kant.

21,"All the same, Kant’s critique of natural theology did not stem from the view that it is an irrational enterprise.  Quite the contrary. The New Atheist supposes that all theology reflects an insufficient respect for reason.

In particular, it reflects the conviction that ultimate explanation is possible, that the world can be made intelligible through and through.

116,"@Tony:      ""I would suggest that the principle only holds within a constrained , limited context, and not absolutely - for the reason that ""equals"" does not inherently mean ""the same in every possible respect"". In the realm of quantity, if you are speaking of one aspect of the two referents x and y, x=y may well imply f(x) = f(y) because you have limited the context of the ""is equal"" itself. But it doesn't hold in every respect if x is not the same as y in every respect. If x is ""8"" and y is ""4 + 4"" and z is ""3 + 5"", then they are not the same in respect of ""expressed as a whole singular"" versus ""expressed as a sum of equal parts"" or ""expressed as a sum of primes""""      The = sign *does* stand for identical; the names in both sides of the sign name the same, identical thing. As far as your putative counter-examples, I would say in response you are no longer talking about ""8"" or even ""8"" under some aspect, but of some other thing altogether that is somehow related to ""8"" -- expression trees, additive or prime decompositions, partitions, or whatever else you have in mind.      I should clarify that I am *not* dismissing any criticisms of first order logic, or even saying that this way of talking is the best way of talking in every possible practical and theoretical subject. To give a simple, obvious example, as far as I know there is no good satisfactory account of intensional contexts. This way of talking entails no contradictions (or at least any obvious ones) and is especially useful in mathematics though; part of the reasons are certainly contingent and reflect the way how mathematicians are trained, but I would contend that they also reflect a deep intuition. Mathematical objects are simple in the sense that their identity conditions are sharp and clearly delineated -- they are the furthest removed from the material. Virtually all of mathematics can be formalized in ZFC, possibly with some extra large cardinal axioms; *equality* itself can be defined in terms of the other primitives (in symbols: x = y iff forall z, z e x <=> z e y). In this setting, we have: (1) *everything* is a set and (2) *everything* can be constructed bottom up from the empty set via (possibly transfinite) iteration. This is a large amount of reduction and simplification, yielding a powerful framework. But to circle back to the criticisms, it also has its downsides. Now suddenly, it make senses to ask the non-sensical question if the number 5 is an element of the number 1023. This question has a definite truth value but its value depends on the specific, non-essential details of the construction of the natural numbers in ZFC.",tony would suggest principle hold within constrained limited context absolutely - reason equal inherently mean every possible respect realm quantity speaking one aspect two referent x xy may well imply fx fy limited context equal hold every respect x every respect x z respect expressed whole singular versus expressed sum equal part expressed sum prime sign stand identical name side sign name identical thing far putative counter-examples would say response longer talking even aspect thing altogether somehow related -- expression tree additive prime decomposition partition whatever else mind clarify dismissing criticism first order logic even saying way talking best way talking every possible practical theoretical subject give simple obvious example far know good satisfactory account intensional context way talking entail contradiction least obvious one especially useful mathematics though part reason certainly contingent reflect way mathematician trained would contend also reflect deep intuition mathematical object simple sense identity condition sharp clearly delineated -- furthest removed material virtually mathematics formalized zfc possibly extra large cardinal axiom equality defined term primitive symbol x iff forall z z e x z e setting everything set everything constructed bottom empty set via possibly transfinite iteration large amount reduction simplification yielding powerful framework circle back criticism also downside suddenly make sens ask non-sensical question number element number question definite truth value value depends specific non-essential detail construction natural number zfc,,2648,1
50,"@Anon      ""It's hard for me to even understand why you would want to make such a distinction except unless you were motivated by the desire to deny the force of arguments for the existence of God.""      Well, Kant starts with the humean thesis that sense data can only generate contigent knowledge. He quickly realized that empiricism is dumb, for we do have necessary knowledge, so he was a sort of rationalist early. Necessary knowledge comes from reason.      But them Kant understood that sense data is pretty much how we have information about reality, so if our necessary knowledge does not come from the senses them it either:      1\. Has no basis on reality and is mere play with definitions(which smart empiricists do defend).      2\. Come from something else.      The prussian argued that at least mathematics is a sort of necessary knowledge that is not created by language, so 2 won. His answer was that we can know some truths about how we happen to organize sense data by analysing the necessary conditions to our experience to it to be how it is. For instance, every experience we have is in time, it has a sucession and all that, so we can derive several truths about that(inded, mathematics would have his origin on the forms of time and space).      And so, by knowing this structure we could show that every possible experience we could have need to obey a certain structure and so gather several truths about how things appear to us. This method is worthless to know things we cant empirically know, though.",anon hard even understand would want make distinction except unless motivated desire deny force argument existence god well kant start humean thesis sense data generate contigent knowledge quickly realized empiricism dumb necessary knowledge sort rationalist early necessary knowledge come reason kant understood sense data pretty much information reality necessary knowledge come sens either basis reality mere play definitionswhich smart empiricist defend come something else prussian argued least mathematics sort necessary knowledge created language answer know truth happen organize sense data analysing necessary condition experience instance every experience time sucession derive several truth thatinded mathematics would origin form time space knowing structure could show every possible experience could need obey certain structure gather several truth thing appear u method worthless know thing cant empirically know though,,1531,1
