Pascal famously argued that practical reasoning should lead people to try to
form within themselves a commitment to religious practice and obedience, based
upon a belief in God. I propose to take a less ambitious argument, which I
call the Sensible Argument, and use it to present The Puzzle. I argue that
there is a huge puzzle here, about the radical dissonance between the beliefs
and practices of many of the purportedly religious. There are, I will argue,
good reasons to doubt, concerning many (clearly not all or indeed most)
purported religious believers, whether they are indeed believers, or at least
whether their beliefs are strong; and religion seems to greatly increase the
risks of deception, duplicity, and hypocrisy, as well as self-deception and
inauthenticity. By turning towards a religious form of life, one will
therefore be adding great morality-related risks. Arguably, if there is a God
who deeply cares about individual moral behaviour, he would punish religious
moral transgressors more than the secular ones. One is unlikely to be saved
from hell (or other severe divine punishment) by becoming religious. If one is
going to wager, it seems much more sensible to wager on the secular side.

My second worry is the one I want to briefly focus on in this post. The worry
is that it fails to get at what is potentially a deeper distinction, and one
that's potentially more illuminating than the distinction between physicalism
and supernaturalism. The distinction I have in mind is at the level of _basic
ontological categories_ and _categorical priority_ \-- in particular, the
level of the ontological priority of the categories of _substance_ and
_property_. According to a standard and historically prominent view,
substances are more fundamental than properties (or at least: substances are
no less fundamental than properties). Accordingly, let's call this sort of
view _a substance-first ontology_.

Which view is correct: the substance-first view or the property-first view?
This question has potentially huge implications for the disagreement between
theists and non-theists.[1] This is because, prima facie, _orthodox monotheism
entails the substance-first view._ And this in turn is because, prima facie,
_God_ is a substance, and is prior to all else that exists. Therefore, if
there are reasons to prefer the property-first view, then there are thereby
reasons to prefer non-theism to theism.

[1] There are other views that are equally powerful threats to theism, such as
a stuff-first view, according to which stuffs are more fundamental than
substances. Another is Jason Turner's facts-first ontology (as well as related
events-first ontologies). However, I leave these sort of threats to the side
for the present post.

The evidence for fine-tuning confirms both demiurgism and panentheism over
theism, and in this way is good evidence against theism. This is because the
intuitive and empirical evidence against creation _ex nihilo_ creates a strong
drag on theism’s prior probability not suffered by demiurgism and panentheism,
and so they lap the former in terms of posterior probability. _A fortiori_ ,
the posterior probability of the inclusive disjunction of demiurgism and
panentheism is considerably higher than that of theism given the evidence of
fine-tuning.

I think a naturalist who adopts Paul's one-category ontology can exploit her
account to explain the existence and fine-tuning of our universe. To start,
consider that if we assume with Paul that the world-whole is just the sum of
all qualities, and they can combine in various ways in accordance with the
constraints of their intrinsic natures, _what prevents them from combining in
every possible such way_? It would be mysterious why they fuse/bundle in some
ways and not others if they didn't fuse/bundle in every way consistent with
their natures. Paul's one-category ontology thus naturally generates pressure
to accept a mereology-focused variant of Spinoza's negative PSR:

> _Negative Mereological PSR (NMPSR)_ : a given plurality of qualities will
> fuse/bundle unless there is a sufficient reason for why they do not.

Given NMPSR, then, we should assume that all possible bundles/fusions exist in
the world-whole. If so, then we can explain everything the theist wants
explained:

Why does anything exist? Because qualities exist and they're necessary beings
that exist _a se_.

Why does a universe exist? Because (as we know from our observations of the
actual world) there is a compossible distribution of qualities in some
"region" of the world-whole that comprises a universe. So by that fact and
NMPSR, there is a presumption to think that it is _inevitable_ that there is a
_fusion/bundle_ of those properties -- i.e., a mereological fusion of
qualities that make up a configuration space, along with a fusion of phase and
amplitude properties, that compose a universal wavefunction. From non-
spatiotemporal property configurations like this, you necessarily get
spatiotemporal universes that logically supervene upon them.[3]

Why does _this_ universe exist? By NMPSR, absent a good reason to think
otherwise, we should assume _all_ possible universe quality fusions exist
inevitably and necessarily within the world-whole of qualities, and this is
one of them.[4]

[1] On Paul's account, the relation of mereological bundling here is not a
fundamentally spatiotemporal one of spatiotemporal parts composing a
spatiotemporal whole. This is because contemporary physics seems to have shown
that spacetime isn't fundamental (think, for example, of wave function realism
with respect to quantum mechanics, theories of quantum gravity that take
spacetime to be emergent, etc.).

[2] Question: How does a quality become spatiotemporally localized on Paul's
view? Answer: By bundling with spatiotemporal properties/relations: "Objects
may have their locations in virtue of being fused with whatever location
properties and relations there are that define the actual space of the world,
and many objects will have a physical structure in virtue of having location
properties and relations as parts of their fusions, or in virtue of being part
of a larger fusion which has location properties and relations as parts. The
character of the space might not be what we take the character of ordinary
spacetime to be, but the structure of the space is generated by fusing
qualitative properties with relevant properties and relations that define the
space as determined by modern physics. Hence, the view is consistent with (and
explicitly accommodating of) various approaches in modern physics: it is
friendly to structuralism, and is perfectly consistent with realist
interpretations of the ontology of quantum mechanics, for example, with
realism about the wavefunction." (Paul, Building the World From Its
Fundamental Constituents", p. 242).

[3] As Paul points out, her one-category ontology is compatible with a parts-
to-whole mosaic, as well as a holistic whole-to-parts picture. She prefers the
latter because it's a better fit with with quantum holism/entanglement
phenomena.

Paul's hypothesis of a one-category ontology is much more parsimonious than
theism's, which posits irreducible substances -- and irreducibly different
_kinds_ of substances -- in addition to qualities. It also also has wider
scope than theism, as it can explain God (if there is a god) in terms of a
fusion of qualities. It can also explain the existence of God in terms of a
derivative being that supervenes upon the modal space of qualities.
Unfortunately, the latter two claims are incompatible with classical theism,
as they violate the doctrine of divine simplicity and both conjuncts of the
aseity-sovereignty doctrine (i.e., the doctrine that (i) God is an absolutely
independent being, dependent upon/derivative of nothing and (ii) everything
distinct from God depends upon her for their existence). All else being equal,
then, a one-category ontology of qualities is a more plausible theory of
ultimate reality than theism.

Abstract: Christian orthodoxy essentially involves the acceptance of the New
Testament as authoritative in matters of faith and conduct. However, the New
Testament instructs slaves and women to accept a subordinate status that
denies their equality with other human beings. To accept such a status is to
have the vice of servility, which involves denying the equality of all human
beings. Therefore the New Testament asserts that slaves and women should deny
their equality with other human beings. This is false. Moreover, these same
passages in the New Testament implicitly assert that slavery and the
subordination of women are morally permissible. This is also false. Therefore
orthodox Christianity is false.

Abstract: The challenge from religious diversity is widely thought to be one
of the most important challenges facing religious belief. Despite this
consensus, however, many epistemologists think that standard versions of the
challenge fail because they threaten to implicate many seemingly reasonable
yet highly controversial non-religious beliefs. In light of this we develop an
alternative, less discussed, diversity challenge that does not generalize.
This challenge concerns why so much religious diversity exists in the first
place given common religious, and in particular theistic, views. Although
there are some interesting scientific explanations of such diversity,
satisfying theistic explanations of its existence are still required.

Abstract: Problem one: why, if God designed the human mind, did it take so
long for humans to develop theistic concepts and beliefs? Problem two: why
would God use evolution to design the living world when the discovery of
evolution would predictably contribute to so much nonbelief in God? Darwin was
aware of such questions but failed to see their evidential significance for
theism. This paper explores this significance. Problem one introduces
something I call natural nonbelief, which is significant because it parallels
and corroborates well-known worries about natural evil. Problems one and two,
especially when combined, support naturalism over theism, intensify the
problem of divine hiddenness, challenge Alvin Plantinga’s views about the
naturalness of theism, and advance the discussion about whether the conflict
between science and religion is genuine or superficial

Abstract: An evolutionary by-product explanation entails that religious belief
is an unintended consequence of a cognitive process selected for by evolution.
In this paper, I argue that if a by-product explanation is true, then
religious belief is unwarranted (even if God exists). In particular, I argue
that if the cause of religious belief is the god-faculty (HADD + ToM + eToM +
MCI), then it is likely unreliable; thus, religious belief is unwarranted.
Plantinga argues that de jure criticisms are not independent of de facto
criticisms: without knowing whether or not God exists, one can’t say that
belief in God is unwarranted, since if God exists, it is possible that God has
planned that this mechanism would lead to belief in Him. Against Plantinga, I
show that in order for de jure criticisms to have force, it is not necessary
to know that God does not exist. Instead, one only needs to doubt His
existence. And if by-product explanations turn out to be supported by the
evidence, this fact alone gives us reason to doubt God’s existence. Thus, if
the by-product explanation is true, belief in God is not warranted; if we know
this, then we have reason to doubt theism.

###  Jeremy Koons' New Paper on Theism and the Meaning of Life

Abstract: The divine purpose theory —according to which that human life is
meaningful to the extent that it fulfills some purpose or plan to which God
has directed us—encounters well-known Euthyphro problems. Some theists attempt
to avoid these problems by appealing to God’s essential goodness, à la the
modified divine command theory of Adams and Alston. However, recent criticisms
of the modified DCT show its conception of God’s goodness to be incoherent;
and these criticisms can be shown to present an analogous set of problems for
the DPT. Further, the argument can be extended to any account of
meaningfulness according to which the value of what humans do can only be
conferred by God. Thus, it would seem that there is no tenable version of the
view that meaningfulness is conferred on human life by some act or attitude of
God’s.

## Is God the Best Explanation of Things? A Dialogue is Now Out!

It's common to see arguments in philosophy of religion that aim to establish
the existence of a perfect being, where the perfections are taken to be
maximal expressions of a special subset of personal qualities (e.g.,
omnipotence, omniscience, and moral perfection). Standard arguments include
ontological arguments and so-called "Stage Two" reasoning in cosmological
arguments.

A standard objection to such arguments is that it's not at all clear that such
properties are individually possible and/or collectively compossible. But I
want to raise a deeper problem that, so far as I've been able to tell, has
never been put directly. The problem is that such arguments not only assume
that such properties are compossible, but also that they are instantiable as
_basic_ or _foundational_ properties. But of course the non-theist will have
principled worries, based on what they take to be our best theories about the
world, that personal attributes are not properties that can be instantiated as
basic our foundational properties -- i.e. they're not ground-floor properties,
but rather _derivative_ properties that are grounded (at least in part) in the
physical. They will thus have non-trivial, substantive worries that it's
_metaphysically impossible_ for personal attributes to exist at the
metaphysical ground floor -- at least unaccompanied by physical properties (or
whatever the physical is ultimately composed of).

Similarly for Stage Two cosmological arguments. A generic example of a Stage
Two cosmological argument runs (very roughly) as follows: The necessary being
at the foundation of reality must be an absolutely unlimited being. For
(assuming we can show that a necessary being doesn't have essential internal
limits that are knowable, if at all, a posteriori) the only way that a being
could have limits is if there were some other entity that limited it, and yet
we are talking about the foundation of reality, where (assuming we could show
that there is only one "plank" in reality's foundation) there is nothing
external around to limit it. So it must have unlimited attributes, where these
include the personal attributes mentioned above (Why not also unlimited _non-
personal_ attributes, such as infinite spatial extension? Spinoza must be
rolling in his grave.). But as with Plantinga's modal ontological argument,
what is left unstated yet assumed is that personal attributes are or can be
_basic_ or _foundational_ , _ground-floor properties_ , and not _derivative_ ,
_non-foundational properties_. But as we've seen, such an assumption is
contrary to all experience (or at least our best theories), in which case
there are non-trivial worries that a personal foundation of at least _that_
sort may well be impossible. So it's completely question-begging against at
least certain standard pictures of naturalism.

What about a liberal naturalist like myself? I'm in print as having Russellian
monist -- indeed, priority cosmopsychist -- sympathies. But even on _that_
view, physical characteristics are _also_ fundamental, and _essentially_ so.
So we can't get support for the theistic picture from there, either.

Some things worthy of note. First, there are very many more arguments for
atheism than commonly supposed. Second, while categorization is inevitably
somewhat arbitrary, there are clearly very many more _types_ of atheistic
arguments than commonly supposed -- on my reckoning, 20 other types of
atheistic argument besides the problem of evil. Third, about 120 atheistic
arguments (roughly 75%) have nothing to do with the problem of evil --
problems of evil are in the minority. Fourth, the list doesn't include
arguments specifically against orthodox Christianity. If it did, the list
would be considerably longer. Fifth, the case for atheism doesn't at all
depend on the success of the problem of evil.

Sixth, the evidence against theism appears to be _systemic,_ comprising __
facts about: the nature of _abstracta_ and _concreta_ ; the nature, origin,
and general structure of the universe; the nature, origin, and history of
life; the nature of consciousness; the nature, origin, biology, and psychology
of human beings; the nature, origins, and dynamics of religions and religious
experience; the existence and nature of morality; the meaning of life; the
aesthetics of the universe; epistemic phenomena; the concept of God and the
properties such a god would have; divine hiddenness; evil; etc. In short,
virtually every major aspect of reality and our knowledge of it seems to point
_away_ from theism and towards some form of naturalism. Prima facie, then,
naturalism appears to be a comprehensive theory of reality that best embodies
the theoretical virtues (e.g., simplicity, scope, conservatism, etc.). To
overcome the case for atheism, therefore, theists have much more work to do
besides attacking this or that argument against theism. In particular, theists
need to generate a rival explanation of the data above that embodies the
theoretical virtues better than naturalism. It's not at all clear that they
can succeed.

Finally, it needs to be said that most people who care about arguments for and
against theism are adherents of some form of orthodox religious monotheism or
other. Among such groups, it's typically thought that the case for their faith
must be persuasive, such that no (or almost no) mature, rational, properly
functioning human being who appraised the relevant evidence could non-culpably
fail to believe after assessing it (on the grounds that (i) God holds people
morally responsible for their belief, and (ii) God would be less than
perfectly good if he held people morally responsible for their belief if the
evidence were less than persuasive). Thus, consider some rational, mature,
properly functioning adult agnostic, Joe _,_ who has strongly grasped,
internalized, and carefully appraised the above arguments, as well as all the
arguments for theism on the other side of the ledger. Suppose further that
after long and careful reflection, Joe finds the grounds for atheism to be
either stronger than those for theism, or at best, counterbalanced with them.
Finally, suppose that Joe thereby either disbelieves or suspends judgement
about theism. According to the group of theists specified just above, there
can be no one like Joe: The evidence for orthodox monotheism is _so_ good that
for _any_ person _S,_ if _S_ is a rational, mature, properly functioning
agent, and __ (after careful reflection and deliberation) _S_ fails to find
the evidence to support theism over atheism, or if _S_ merely finds the
evidence to be _counterbalanced_ \-- or indeed, if _S_ finds themself _unable
to tell,_ with any confidence, which way the evidence points -- then _S_ is
_morally culpable_ for failing to believe in the relevant version of orthodox
monotheism. In light of the case for atheism expressed in the arguments listed
above, this looks to be implausible, if not ridiculous.

###  Varieties of The Principle of Material Causality and the Problem of
Creation Ex Nihilo

There are at least seven versions of the principle of material causality:

1\. _Strong De Dicto PMC_ : Necessarily, all individuals and stuffs that have
an originating or sustaining efficient cause have an originating or sustaining
material cause, respectively.

2\. _Strong De Re PMC_ : All individuals and stuffs (in the _actual_ world)
are such that, necessarily, _they_ have an originating or sustaining material
cause whenever they have an originating or sustaining efficient cause,
respectively.

3\. _Standard PMC_ : All individuals and stuffs that have an originating or
sustaining efficient cause have an originating or sustaining material cause,
respectively.

4\. _Defeasible PMC_ : Normally, individuals and stuffs with originating or
sustaining efficient causes have originating or sustaining material causes,
respectively.

5\. _IBE PMC_ : Theories that conform to PMC are more theoretically virtuous
than those that fail to conform to PMC.

6\. _Bayesian PMC_ : Theories that conform to PMC have a much higher prior
probability than those that fail to conform to PMC.

7\. _Weak PMC_ : Possibly, all individuals and stuffs that have an originating
or sustaining efficient cause have an originating or sustaining material
cause, respectively.

From each principle, one can generate a defensible version of the problem of
creation _ex nihilo_. There are therefore at least seven defensible versions
of the problem of creation _ex nihilo_ for theism.

The problem of many-over-one asks how it can be that many properties are ever
instantiated by one object. A putative solution might, for example, claim that
the properties are appropriately bundled, or somehow tied to a bare
particular. In this essay, the author argues that, surprisingly, an extant
candidate solution to this problem is at the same time an independently
developed candidate solution to the mind-body problem. Specifically, what is
argued here to be the best version of the relata-specific bundle theory—the
thesis that each instance of compresence has a special intrinsic nature in
virtue of which it necessarily bundles its specific bundle-ees—is also a
species of Russellian monism, labeled by David Chalmers as ‘constitutive
Russellian panprotopsychism’. The upshot of this connection is significant for
the metaphysics of the mind-body problem: a credible theory of property
instantiation turns out to have a built-in account of how consciousness is
grounded in certain (broadly) physical systems.

There is a longstanding argument that purports to show that divine
foreknowledge is inconsistent with human freedom to do otherwise. Proponents
of this argument, however, have for some time been met with the following
reply: the argument posits what would have to be a mysterious non-causal
constraint on freedom. In this paper, I argue that this objection is misguided
– not because after all there can indeed be non-causal constraints on freedom
(as in Pike, Fischer, and Hunt), but because the success of the
incompatibilist’s argument does not require the real possibility of non-causal
constraints on freedom. I contend that the incompatibilist’s argument is best
seen as showing that, given divine foreknowledge, something makes one unfree –
and that this something is most plausibly identified, not with the
foreknowledge itself, but with the causally deterministic factors that would
have to be in place in order for there to be infallible foreknowledge in the
first place.

###  Newlands' Recent Paper Arguing that PSR Leads to Monism

Abstract: The Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR) has been linked to a
variety of esoteric views in metaphysics. This paper explores another PSR
trail through the metaphysical backwoods, this time a path from theistic
idealism to substance monism. In particular, I will claim that the same style
of argument that might be offered for a Leibnizian form of metaphysical
idealism actually leads beyond idealism to something closer to Spinozistic
monism. Our road begins with a set of theological commitments about the nature
and perfection of God that were widely shared among leading early modern
philosophers. From these commitments, there arises an interesting case for
metaphysical idealism, roughly the thesis that only minds and mind-dependent
states actually exist. However, I will argue, that same theistic reasoning
also leads to an idealist form of substance monism, the view that God is the
only actual substance and that almost everything else is merely an intentional
object in God’s mind.

For what it's worth, I was the commenter on an earlier version of Coley's
paper at the 2018 SPR meeting. Below are the comments I presented at that
meeting.

I want to thank Scott Coley for his stimulating paper on evolutionary
debunking and arguments against theism. Coley’s paper argues that Sharon
Street’s Darwinian dilemma, when combined with philosophical naturalism,
defeats any epistemic grounds for moral realism the naturalist might have had.
But if so, then since arguments from evil and divine hiddenness each contain a
premise that crucially relies on the truth of moral realism, naturalists
cannot consistently appeal to such arguments as grounds for rejecting theism.
By bringing important recent work in contemporary meta-ethics to bear on the
problems of evil and divine hiddenness, Coley’s argument is a welcome
contribution to the dialogue concerning the epistemic credentials of theism
and naturalism.

Let us now turn to take a closer look at Coley’s argument.

In laying out Coley’s argument, let’s follow him by letting ‘N’ denote the
normative premise in an atheistic argument (such as in the arguments from evil
and divine hiddenness); letting ‘C’ denote a conclusion that theism is (at
least) probably false; and letting ‘sanspsychism’ refer to any view that
entails that no supramundane consciousness exists (e.g., a divine person of
some sort). Coley’s core argument then runs as follows:

1\. If we affirm sanspsychism then we should embrace moral skepticism.

2\. If we should embrace moral skepticism then we should reject N.

3\. So, if we affirm sanspychism then we should refrain from affirming N. (1,
2

4\. If we assent to C then we should affirm sanspsychism.

5\. So, if we assent to C then we should refrain from affirming N. (4,3 HS)

What to make of Coley’s argument? An initial question concerns (1) as
currently stated. For Coley grants that at least some versions of moral
realism are ultimately compatible with sanspsychism, viz., Peter Railton’s
moral naturalism and those relevantly similar to it. Of course we’ve seen that
Coley argues that Railton-style moral realism provides no help in supporting
N. However, I’m not so sure about that, for reasons I’ll discuss below.
Therefore, let us modify Coley’s (1) and (2) accordingly to take account of
this other type of meta-ethical option allowed for the sanspsychist. The
argument then runs as follows:

1’. If we affirm sanspsychism, then we should embrace either moral skepticism
or

2’. If we should embrace either moral skepticism or Railton-style moral
realism,

3\. So, if we affirm sanspsychism, then we should refrain from affirming N.
(1, 2

4\. If we assent to C, then we should affirm sanspsychism.

5\. So, if we assent to C, then we should refrain from affirming N. (4,3 HS)

The bulk of the paper can then be seen as a defense of premises (1’) and (2’)
of the reconstructed argument above.

Given this reconstruction of Coley’s argument, is there any way in which a
naturalist might sensibly resist it? In the remainder of the paper, I will
sketch some possible replies to the first two premises of the argument on
behalf of the sanspsychist.

Start with (1’). Why should we accept it? Here is my reconstruction of Coley’s
argument for the premise :

Step 1: If we affirm sanspsychism, then we should embrace moral realism.

Step 2: If we should embrace moral realism, then we should affirm that either
selective evolutionary pressures are connected to the moral facts or they
aren’t.

Step 3: If we should affirm that evolutionary selective pressures are
connected to the moral facts, then we should embrace Railton-style moral
realism.

Step 4: If we should affirm that selective evolutionary pressures aren’t
connected to the moral facts, then we should affirm that moral realism is
defeated by Street’s evolutionary debunking argument.

Step 5: If we should affirm that moral realism is defeated by Street’s
evolutionary debunking argument, then we should embrace moral skepticism.

1’. Therefore, if we affirm sanspsychism, then we should embrace either

I can think of four steps in this sub-argument that the non-theist might
reject, viz., steps 1, 3, 4, and 5.

Regarding Steps 1 and 5: One might be tempted to object to Step 1 on the
grounds that there are plenty of sanspsychists who are living counterexamples
to it, e.g., moral relativists, nihilists, and various sorts of non-
cognitivists. However, remember that Coley can safely screen these cases off,
as (i) he has explicitly restricted the relevant class of sanspsychists to
those who want to advance an argument from evil or divine hiddenness, and (ii)
(Coley argues that) such sanspsychists can only do so if they also assert both
that there are facts about human morality and that human morality overlaps
with God’s morality (if God exists). Having said that, however, it’s not clear
to me that such restrictions screen off all relevant meta-ethical theories
available to the type of sanspsychists at issue. Here I have in mind Kantian
constructivist accounts. Versions include those articulated by Kant,
Korsgaard, Rawls, and Scanlon. According to at least some of these versions,
there are constitutive features of rational, autonomous agents from which a
set of categorical imperatives necessarily flows. But if so, then if God is
also a rational, autonomous agent, and we are supposed to be made in His
image, then perhaps more should be said about why a sanspsychist can’t appeal
to such meta-ethical theories to support normative premises in arguments from
evil and divine hiddenness.

Regarding Step 3: A number of accounts of moral realism besides Railton’s have
been articulated and defended that allow — and sometimes insist — that
evolution has reliably shaped our system of evaluative judgments. Perhaps the
most relevant is neo-Aristotelian virtue theory, most notably developed and
defended by Rosalind Hursthouse, Philippa Foot, and (most recently) Micah
Lott. According to this version of virtue theory, moral goodness is analyzed
in terms of what is good for members of a given species, which in turn is
defined in terms of what allows its members to carry out their characteristic
life-cycle, which in turn has been shaped by evolutionary factors. On this
sort of account, moral knowledge is a kind of practical knowledge of how to
achieve one’s species-specific goods. Given this sort of account, it is
guaranteed that evolution will shape our evaluative judgments in a way that is
truth-tracking. For those individuals whose evaluative judgments fail to
reliably track the truth about what’s good for them are thereby selected out.

Regarding Step 4: A number of non-natural moral realists have rejected this
premise. For example, moral intuitionists such as Michael Huemer argue that
moral truths are necessary truths, known via reason. Therefore, the way we
know moral truths is the same way we know other necessary truths (e.g. those
of mathematics and philosophy). And while there is as of yet no complete
account of the mechanics of a priori knowledge , this fact hasn’t led many to
deny that we have mathematical knowledge. But if not, then by the same token,
it shouldn’t lead one to reject moral knowledge.

Is an intuitionist account of moral knowledge metaphysically problematic for
the sanspsychist? I don’t see why it would be. That view only rules out
supramundane minds, and Platonism doesn’t obviously require that such minds
exist.

Perhaps at this point one will raise Benacerraf’s epistemological objection to
knowledge of abstract objects: Knowledge requires causal contact with the
thing known. But causal contact is impossible with respect to abstract
objects; therefore, if moral (or mathematical, or philosophical) facts are
abstract, then we can’t have knowledge of them. However, given the certainty
and theoretical indispensability of many of these truths, it’s not clear why
intuitionists can’t here pull a G.E. Moore shift: “We have reliable belief
forming processes regarding mathematical and philosophical truths. If moral
facts lack causal powers, then so do these other sorts of facts. Therefore, if
moral facts lack causal powers, then our having reliable belief forming
processes does not require the facts about which we have beliefs to have
causal powers.” (Huemer 2016)

Other (natural and) non-natural moral realists resist this horn of Street’s
Darwinian dilemma in other ways. For example, Erik Wielenberg argues that
while evolution didn’t select for knowledge of moral truths, it selected for
something else that is adaptive and which correlates with moral truths. In
particular, he argues that creatures with cognitive capacities like ours
thereby have rights. But evolution didn’t select for this knowledge. Rather,
it selected for our cognitive capacities, which in turn help us survive and
reproduce. But creatures with such capacities are thereby able to grasp the
concept of a right, and to come to believe that they have them.

What about premise (2’)? Here is my reconstruction of Coley’s argument for it:
Suppose the sanspsychist should embrace either (a) moral skepticism or (b)
Railton-style moral realism. Now consider the implications of each option:

Step 1: If the sanspsychist should embrace moral skepticism, then she should
(thereby) doubt the reliability of human moral cognition.

Step 2: If she should doubt the reliability of human moral cognition, then she
should reject N.

Step 3: Therefore, if the sanspsychist should embrace moral skepticism, then
she should reject N.

Step 1: If the sanspsychist should embrace Railton-style moral realism, then
she should affirm that she has no good reason to think that our morality is
God’s morality.

Step 2: If she should affirm that she has no good reason to think that our
morality is God’s morality, then she should reject N.

Step 3: Therefore, if the sanspsychist should embrace Railton-style moral
realism, then she should reject N.

2’. Therefore, If the sanspsychist should embrace moral skepticism or Railton-
style moral realism, then she should reject N.

What to make of this argument? I can imagine a naturalist raising concerns for
the reasoning with both options. First, she might worry about Step 2 for both
Option (a) and Option (b). This is because it’s prima facie constitutive of
classical theism that God is morally perfect, that God has revealed moral
obligations and prohibitions to humans (through special revelation,
conscience, and perhaps other ways), and that a number of these apply to God
as well. But if so, then to consistently assert the normative premise of the
problem of evil, they need merely point out that theism implies that the
states of affairs at issue are morally bad, and that God’s moral perfection
implies that God can’t permit them without sufficient reason. It therefore
seems that even a naturalist who is a moral nihilist could consistently affirm
the premises of a version of the problem of evil without committing to the
truth of the moral claims involved.

Second, a naturalist might object to Step 1 of Option (b). Here one can
reiterate the ways (mentioned in Section 3) in which a naturalist might reason
that human morality overlaps with God’s if God should turn out to exist. By
way of reminder, they were as follows: (i) If the moral rules are those that
any rational, autonomous agent would construct, and God is also a rational,
autonomous agent, then prima facie, our morality overlaps with God’s; (ii) the
moral rules we’ve discovered apply to at least humans. But if theism is true,
then humans are made in God’s image, which presumably includes his likeness in
rational and moral respects. There is therefore a presumption for thinking
that our morality overlaps with God’s.

I have offered four main replies to Coley’s argument on behalf of the
naturalist or sanpsychist: (i) the debunking argument doesn’t rule out Kantian
constructivist accounts of meta-ethics; (ii) some forms of moral realism
appear to survive the debunking argument (e.g., Railton’s account, Huemer’s
account, Wielenberg’s account, and neo-Aristotelian accounts); (iii) there are
reasons to think that on any of the accounts above, our morality overlaps with
God’s if he should turn out to exist; and (iv) the problems of evil and divine
hiddenness can be seen as problems internal to theism itself, in which case
the naturalist or sanspsychist need not have substantive moral beliefs to
consistently raise them against theism.

i. Assume throughout that ‘morality’ denotes only accounts of morality that
lack a divine source.

ii. But see Bonjour (1999), Huemer (2016), Chudnoff (2013), and Bengson (2015)
for recent defenses.

Yes, for on the kind of necessitarianism at issue, if there is a god, then God

###  The Metaphysics of Modality and Plantinga's Free Will Defense: A Tension

An aspect of Plantinga's free will defense (FWD) -- in particular, his
doctrine of possible universal transworld depravity (PUTD) -- has been
bothering me for a good while. The worry can be put in terms of a dilemma:
Either PUTD assumes the distribution of possible worlds is prior to God's
will, or it assumes the distribution is posterior to it. But if PUTD relies on
a distribution of possible worlds that's prior to his will (as with, say,
straight Platonism), then sure, it might, for aught we know, turn out that
God's hands are tied with respect to the distribution of creaturely essences
across the space of possible worlds, and that distribution includes at least
one world in which every creaturely essence is transworld depraved. But that
assumption leads to other problems that are costly to traditional monotheists.
First, it's a weird take on omnipotence: There are a lot more impossible
things that we antecedently thought were possible (e.g., some actualizable
creaturely essences or other at every possible world who always freely choose
to do what is right of their own accord). The threat of modal skepticism
looms, and in its train, skepticism about the possibility premise in
Plantinga's modal ontological argument. Second, it's incompatible with
Plantinga's acceptance of theistic conceptualism. Third, the existence of a
distribution of possible worlds and creaturely essences that are prior to
God's will (as abstract _possibilia_ lurking in platonic space) seems
incompatible with the aseity-sovereignty doctrine.

So dilemma: Either: (i) reject theistic conceptualism, accept modal
skepticism, and reject the aseity-sovereignty doctrine), or (ii) reject
Plantinga's FWD. Unsavory choices all around for traditional theist.

[2] One might object that the existence of the specifically traditional
theistic god could be confirmed via inference to the best explanation (IBE),
but Thomasson argues (a la Shalkowski, Saatsi, and others) that while IBE may
be a legitimate form of inference in ordinary contexts (e.g., in confirming
that a mouse is in the house via data such as small droppings, gnawed holes in
food bags, etc.) and in the sciences, it isn't legitimate in metaphysics. This
is because hypotheses of the former sorts can be _independently confirmed_ in
ordinary contexts (say, by waiting up to catch the mouse with a mousetrap),
but not in metaphysics. Indeed, IBE _itself_ can be independently confirmed as
a reliable method of inference in ordinary contexts (via empirical feedback),
but not in metaphysics.

###  Climenhaga's New Paper Raises a Problem for Skeptical Theists

Abstract: According to a simple Bayesian argument from evil, the evil we
observe is less likely given theism than given atheism, and therefore lowers
the probability of theism. I consider the most common skeptical theist
response to this argument, according to which our cognitive limitations make
the probability of evil given theism inscrutable. I argue that if skeptical
theists are right about this, then the probability of theism given evil is
itself largely inscrutable, and that if this is so, we ought to be agnostic
about whether God exists.

Hi Scott,  
  
You bet. Looking forward to reading the interview!  

On a quick read I thought it was an interesting paper. I took the main worry
to be this. If we're souls, then origin essentialism doesn't apply.  
  
I don't agree with that claim. It seems to me that even if we are souls,
different processes could be used to get duplicate souls. So God could create
a soul ex nihilo. But God could also endow physical processes with the ability
to create souls. And a physical process could create a duplicate of the soul
God creates ex nihilo. But they'd originate through different processes. A
soul having a physical origin and a soul having an ex nihilo origin arise
through different processes. So the two souls would be different.  
  
Follow up questions and objections welcome!

###  Quantum Modal Realism and a "Victorious" Ontological Argument for
Naturalism

One can run a minimal modal ontological argument for naturalism with just two
simple premises:

2\. What's necessary doesn't vary from possible world to possible world.

(2) follows from Axiom S5 of S5 modal logic, and most philosophers accept S5,
so it's fairly uncontroversial. So the argument comes down to the plausibility
of (1).

One can run a minimal modal ontological argument for naturalism with just two
simple premises:

1\. Possibly, there is a necessarily existent essentially material thing.[1]
(i.e., the two properties are compossible).

2\. What's necessary doesn't vary from possible world to possible world.

[1] Or whatever ultimately composes material things -- quantum fields,
wavefunction stuff (whether in ordinary 3-space or a massively higher-
dimensional Hilbert space), the strings of string theory, the entities of
causal set theory or loop quantum gravity, etc. Henceforth assume this
qualification when left unstated.

1\. It's possible that there is a being who has all perfections essentially.

3\. Therefore, it's possible that there is a being who has necessary
existence, infinite thought, and infinite extension essentially.

4\. What's possible doesn't vary from possible world to possible world.

5\. Therefore, a being who has infinite thought and infinite extension
essentially actually exists.

This argument is better than the standard modal ontological argument for
theism, since the theistic God lacks extension, and Spinoza seems to be
correct in thinking that infinite extension is a perfection. At the very
least, infinite extension seems to have at least as much going for it as the
attributes of the god of theism. Therefore, at the very least, one has at
least as much reason to accept the above argument for Spinozistic naturalism
as the standard modal ontological argument for theism.

###  Rdzak's Nice Paper on the Incompatibility of PSR and Libertarianism

Abstract: Alexander Pruss’s Principle of Sufficient Reason states that every
contingent true proposition has an explanation. Pruss thinks that he can
plausibly maintain both his PSR and his account of libertarian free will. This
is because his libertarianism has it that contingent true propositions
reporting free choices are self-explanatory. But I don’t think Pruss can
plausibly maintain both his PSR and libertarianism without a rift occurring in
one or the other. Similar to the old luck/randomness objection, I contend that
Pruss’s libertarianism is susceptible to what I call “the inexplicability
objection”, which attempts to show that agents’ free choices involve
contingent brute facts. Pruss may be able to partially explain a proposition
such that Jones freely chose A for reason R, but he cannot adequately explain
a contrastive proposition such as that Jones freely chose A for R rather than
B for R*. The result is that either PSR is too explanatorily permissive for
libertarianism, or libertarianism is too explanatorily impermissive to satisfy
PSR. After considering what I take to be Pruss’s best response to the
inexplicability objection, I conclude that his attempt to reconcile PSR and
libertarianism is unsuccessful.

###  Fantastic New Paper on Fine-Tuning as Evidence for a Multiverse

Is the fact that our universe contains fine-tuned life evidence that we live
in a multiverse? Hacking (1987) and White (2000) influentially argue that it
is not. We approach this question through a systematic framework for self-
locating epistemology. As it turns out, leading approaches to self-locating
evidence agree that the fact that our own universe contains fine-tuned life
indeed confirms the existence of a multiverse (at least in a suitably
idealized setting). This convergence is no accident: we present two theorems
showing that in this setting, *any* updating rule that satisfies a few
reasonable conditions will have the same feature. The conclusion that fine-
tuned life provides evidence for a multiverse is hard to escape.

The phenomena of moral uncertainty of this sort and others is highly
surprising on theism, since it is widely held that on that hypothesis, one
major purpose for humans in this world is that of exercising our moral freedom
to make serious moral choices and to develop our character. In any case, at
the very least, it's surprising on theism to find the world to be one of moral
Russian roulette. By contrast, the phenomena of reasoning under moral
uncertainty is not surprising on the hypothesis of naturalism, since on that
hypothesis, there is no personal god who has made the world to be an arena for
exercising moral freedom and character development. The phenomena of reasoning
under moral uncertainty therefore constitutes at least some evidence for
naturalism vis-a-vis theism.

## Is God the Best Explanation of Things? A Dialogue is Now Out!

Some things worthy of note. First, there are very many more arguments for
atheism than commonly supposed. Second, while categorization is inevitably
somewhat arbitrary, there are clearly very many more _types_ of atheistic
arguments than commonly supposed -- on my reckoning, 20 other types of
atheistic argument besides the problem of evil. Third, about 120 atheistic
arguments (roughly 75%) have nothing to do with the problem of evil --
problems of evil are in the minority. Fourth, the list doesn't include
arguments specifically against orthodox Christianity. If it did, the list
would be considerably longer. Fifth, the case for atheism doesn't at all
depend on the success of the problem of evil.

Sixth, the evidence against theism appears to be _systemic,_ comprising __
facts about: the nature of _abstracta_ and _concreta_ ; the nature, origin,
and general structure of the universe; the nature, origin, and history of
life; the nature of consciousness; the nature, origin, biology, and psychology
of human beings; the nature, origins, and dynamics of religions and religious
experience; the existence and nature of morality; the meaning of life; the
aesthetics of the universe; epistemic phenomena; the concept of God and the
properties such a god would have; divine hiddenness; evil; etc. In short,
virtually every major aspect of reality and our knowledge of it seems to point
_away_ from theism and towards some form of naturalism. Prima facie, then,
naturalism appears to be a comprehensive theory of reality that best embodies
the theoretical virtues (e.g., simplicity, scope, conservatism, etc.). To
overcome the case for atheism, therefore, theists have much more work to do
besides attacking this or that argument against theism. In particular, theists
need to generate a rival explanation of the data above that embodies the
theoretical virtues better than naturalism. It's not at all clear that they
can succeed.

Finally, it needs to be said that most people who care about arguments for and
against theism are adherents of some form of orthodox religious monotheism or
other. Among such groups, it's typically thought that the case for their faith
must be persuasive, such that no (or almost no) mature, rational, properly
functioning human being who appraised the relevant evidence could non-culpably
fail to believe after assessing it (on the grounds that (i) God holds people
morally responsible for their belief, and (ii) God would be less than
perfectly good if he held people morally responsible for their belief if the
evidence were less than persuasive). Thus, consider some rational, mature,
properly functioning adult agnostic, Joe _,_ who has strongly grasped,
internalized, and carefully appraised the above arguments, as well as all the
arguments for theism on the other side of the ledger. Suppose further that
after long and careful reflection, Joe finds the grounds for atheism to be
either stronger than those for theism, or at best, counterbalanced with them.
Finally, suppose that Joe thereby either disbelieves or suspends judgement
about theism. According to the group of theists specified just above, there
can be no one like Joe: The evidence for orthodox monotheism is _so_ good that
for _any_ person _S,_ if _S_ is a rational, mature, properly functioning
agent, and __ (after careful reflection and deliberation) _S_ fails to find
the evidence to support theism over atheism, or if _S_ merely finds the
evidence to be _counterbalanced_ \-- or indeed, if _S_ finds themself _unable
to tell,_ with any confidence, which way the evidence points -- then _S_ is
_morally culpable_ for failing to believe in the relevant version of orthodox
monotheism. In light of the case for atheism expressed in the arguments listed
above, this looks to be implausible, if not ridiculous.

###  On the Compatiblity of Determinism and Libertarian Freedom: A Quick
Sketch

Call the following view **_Everettian libertarianism_** : Everything's
determined by the initial conditions of the universe plus the Schrodinger
equation to play out as it does, but you perform different actions (and thus
have alternative possibilities open to you) in different branches of the wave
function. In fact, you bring about every possible alternative action in some
branch or other of the wave function. So: (i) everything is determined, and
yet (ii) all alternative possibilities are open to you. So libertarian freedom
and determinism are compatible after all.

_Objection_ : That's not you in other branches of the wave function; those are
just counterparts of you.

_Reply_ : On a perfectly reasonable interpretation of the current scientific
evidence, human beings are not single, numerically identical selves in a even
a _single_ world, whether at a given time or over time. So if the objection is
based on some assumed requirement of numerical synchronic or diachronic
personal identity for free will, then that assumption will equally undermine
free will even if you only exist in _one_ branch of the wave function. On the
other hand, on a more relaxed account of personal identity (say, causal
continuity or continuity of memory or personality), then all of your
"counterparts" in various branches of the wave function are "you".

###  Yet Another Version of the Problem of Creation Ex Nihilo

There is both strong intuitive and abductive empirical support for the
principle that all _made_ things and stuffs are made from other things or
stuffs. Given this, any comprehensive metaphysical theory will incur a strong
theoretical cost by including a thesis that falls crosswise of the principle,
such as the doctrine of _creatio ex nihilo_. In particular, the cost will
significantly reduce such a theory's prior probability, putting it at a severe
disadvantage to comprehensive metaphysical theories that can explain all the
same data, and yet don't include the doctrine of _creatio ex nihilo_. Examples
of theories of the latter sort include panentheism and demiurgism. Given that
(for example) panentheism and demiurgism can explain roughly all the same data
as theism, _prima facie_ , theism can never catch up to panentheism and
demiurgism with respect to posterior probability, given the strong drag on its
prior probability incurred by its inclusion of the doctrine of _creatio ex
nihilo_. Therefore, theism is a significantly less probable comprehensive
metaphysical theory than either panentheism or demiurgism.

## Is God the Best Explanation of Things? A Dialogue is Now Out!

Many people have experiences that trigger the belief that reality is a cold
and uncaring place, indifferent to their welfare. Such belief-triggering
experiences are surprising on theism, since on that hypothesis, we'd expect
God to design our cognitive faculties in such a way as to reliably trigger
true beliefs about reality, according to which (on that hypothesis) reality is
not a cold and uncaring place that is indifferent to our welfare. By contrast,
such belief-triggering experiences are not surprising on naturalism, since on
that hypothesis, reality really is a cold and uncaring place that is
indifferent to our welfare. Therefore, the existence and pervasiveness of
anti-religious experience provides at least some confirming evidence for
naturalism vis-a-vis theism.

Hi, you might be interested in Adams and Robson paper from 2016, ‘Does absence
make atheistic belief grow stronger?’. The experiences you write about are
somehow similar to what they call atheistic natural signs.

###  Fantastic Recent Paper on Pragmatic Encroachment and Religious Experience

I've been waiting for about 10 years for someone to carefully lay out the
argument in the following paper, and my wait is now over:

> The secondary literature on religious epistemology has focused extensively
> on whether religious experience can provide evidence for God’s existence. In
> this article, I suppose that religious experience can do this, but I
> consider whether it can provide adequate evidence for justified belief in
> God. I argue that it can. This requires a couple of moves. First, I consider
> the threshold problem for evidentialism and explain pragmatic encroachment
> (PE) as a solution to it. Second, I argue that religious experience can
> justify belief in God if one adopts PE, but this poses a dilemma for the

Spinoza appealed to a version of PSR that has both a positive and negative
component:

> Spinoza's Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR): every fact that obtains has
> a complete explanation for why it obtains, and every fact that fails to
> obtain has a complete explanation for why it fails to obtain.

Suppose you accept Spinoza's PSR. Then you have a reason to think that every
possible world is, and must be, actual. Otherwise, you will be hard pressed to
find an explanation for why some possibilities fail to obtain. But if so, then
there is an under-appreciated rational explanation for why the universe
exists, rather than nothing. It is also an under-appreciated rational
explanation for why our universe exists, rather than another. In this way,
Spinoza's PSR provides the materials for a cosmological argument for
naturalism.

> On my view, matter, concrete objects, abstract objects, and perhaps even
> spacetime are constructed from mereological fusions of qualities, so the

Paul's one category ontology provides a nice an ontological framework for
contemporary physics:

> ...consider the wave-function realist who takes the world-whole to be a
> wavefunction. On the GRW theory of the world, the world is a universal wave
> function that evolves in accordance with the dynamical laws. Understood in

> A variant of this view can fit the Everettian approach, and one can also fit
> David Albert’s (1996) treatment of Bohmian mechanics by adding a world-
> particle that is simply a fusion of properties to the plurality of things. (
> _Ibid_., p. 254).

I think a naturalist who adopts Paul's one-category ontology can exploit her
account to explain the existence and fine-tuning of our universe. To start,
consider that if we assume with Paul that the world-whole is just the sum of
all qualities, and they can combine in various ways in accordance with the
constraints of their intrinsic natures, _what prevents them from combining in
every possible such way_? It would be mysterious why they fuse/bundle in some
ways and not others if they didn't fuse/bundle in every way consistent with
their natures. Paul's one-category ontology thus naturally generates pressure
to accept a mereology-focused variant of Spinoza's negative PSR:

> _Negative Mereological PSR (NMPSR)_ : a given plurality of qualities will
> fuse/bundle unless there is a sufficient reason for why they do not.

Given NMPSR, then, we should assume that all possible bundles/fusions exist in
the world-whole. If so, then we can explain everything the theist wants
explained:

Why does anything exist? Because qualities exist and they're necessary beings
that exist _a se_.

Why does a universe exist? Because (as we know from our observations of the
actual world) there is a compossible distribution of qualities in some
"region" of the world-whole that comprises a universe. So by that fact and
NMPSR, there is a presumption to think that it is _inevitable_ that there is a
_fusion/bundle_ of those properties -- i.e., a mereological fusion of
qualities that make up a configuration space, along with a fusion of phase and
amplitude properties, that compose a universal wavefunction. From non-
spatiotemporal property configurations like this, you necessarily get
spatiotemporal universes that logically supervene upon them.[3]

Why does _this_ universe exist? By NMPSR, absent a good reason to think
otherwise, we should assume _all_ possible universe quality fusions exist
inevitably and necessarily within the world-whole of qualities, and this is
one of them.[4]

To circle back to the original point: Spinoza has been making a comeback in
recent decades in the study of early modern philosophy. His negative PSR is at
least one reason why philosophers of religion should celebrate this.

[1] On Paul's account, the relation of mereological bundling here is not a
fundamentally spatiotemporal one of spatiotemporal parts composing a
spatiotemporal whole. This is because contemporary physics seems to have shown
that spacetime isn't fundamental (think, for example, of wave function realism
with respect to quantum mechanics, theories of quantum gravity that take
spacetime to be emergent, etc.).

[2] Question: How does a quality become spatiotemporally localized on Paul's
view? Answer: By bundling with spatiotemporal properties/relations: "Objects
may have their locations in virtue of being fused with whatever location
properties and relations there are that define the actual space of the world,
and many objects will have a physical structure in virtue of having location
properties and relations as parts of their fusions, or in virtue of being part
of a larger fusion which has location properties and relations as parts. The
character of the space might not be what we take the character of ordinary
spacetime to be, but the structure of the space is generated by fusing
qualitative properties with relevant properties and relations that define the
space as determined by modern physics. Hence, the view is consistent with (and
explicitly accommodating of) various approaches in modern physics: it is
friendly to structuralism, and is perfectly consistent with realist
interpretations of the ontology of quantum mechanics, for example, with
realism about the wavefunction." (Paul, Building the World From Its
Fundamental Constituents", p. 242).

[3] As Paul points out, her one-category ontology is compatible with a parts-
to-whole mosaic, as well as a holistic whole-to-parts picture. She prefers the
latter because it's a better fit with with quantum holism/entanglement
phenomena.

Abstract: Alvin Plantinga has famously argued that the naturalist who accepts
evolutionary theory has a defeater for all of her beliefs, including her
belief in naturalism and evolution. Hence, he says, naturalism, when conjoined
with evolution, is self-defeating and cannot be rationally accepted. This is
known as the evolutionary argument against naturalism. However, Tyler Wunder
has recently shown that if the EAAN is framed in terms of objective
probability and theism is assumed to be non-contingent, then either theism is
necessarily false or the EAAN is unsound. Neither option is attractive to the
proponent of the EAAN. Perry Hendricks has responded to Wunder’s criticism,
showing that the EAAN can be salvaged and, indeed, strengthened, by framing it
in terms not of naturalism, but of a proposition that is entailed by N that is
also consistent with theism. We will show that once Hendricks’ solution to
Wunder’s objection is accepted, a puzzle ensues: if the EAAN provides the
naturalist with a defeater for all of her beliefs, then an extension of it
appears to provide God with a defeater for all of his beliefs. After bringing
out this puzzle, we suggest several ways in which the proponent of the EAAN
might solve it, but also show some potential weaknesses in these purported
solutions. Whether the solutions to the puzzle that we consider ultimately
succeed is unclear to us. that we consider do solve the puzzle while the other
author does not.) However, it is clear to us that this is an issue that
proponents of the EAAN need to address.

###  David Manley's New Paper on God and the Bayesian Conception of Evidence

Contemporary arguments for and against the existence of God are often
formulated within a broadly Bayesian framework. Arguments of this sort focus
on a specific feature of the world that is taken to provide probabilistic
evidence for or against the existence of God: the existence of life in a
‘fine-tuned’ universe, the magnitude of suffering, divine hiddenness, etc. In
each case, the idea is that things were more likely to be this way if God
existed than if God did not exist—or the other way around. Less attention,
however, has been paid to the deeper question of what it takes for something
to count as evidence for or against the existence of God. What exactly is
being claimed when it is said that some feature of the world is more or less
likely given the existence of God, and how should we go about assessing such a
claim? This paper is about epistemological issues—and in particular, certain
potential cognitive errors—that arise when we reason probabilistically about
the existence of God. The moral is not that we should refrain from reasoning
in this way, but that we should be mindful of potential errors when we do.

I advance a novel challenge for Divine Command Theory based on the existence
of psychopaths. The challenge, in a nutshell, is that Divine Command Theory
has the implausible implication that psychopaths have no moral obligations and
hence their evil acts, no matter how evil, are morally permissible. After
explaining this argument, I respond to three objections to it and then
critically examine the prospect that Divine Command Theorists might bite the
bullet and accept that psychopaths can do no wrong. I conclude that the
Psychopathy Objection constitutes a serious and novel challenge for Divine
Command Theory.

###  There are Lots of Arguments Against Theism That Don't Reduce to the
Problem of Evil

Forget the god of classical theism for a moment. Consider instead the
hypothesis that there is a being who is omnipotent and omniscient, yet morally
indifferent, and who is reliable at achieving their goals. Call this view
_blahtheism_. Suppose further that we add to blahtheism the hypothesis that
such a god is interested in creating a hospitable environment for humans
(suppose they have a goal to be reliable in creating and conserving
communities of humans in the way the some build and maintain ant farms). What
would you then expect Earth to be like? The answer is simple: one that is
hospitable to human life. Therefore, the datum that the Earth is inhospitable
to humans is surprising on blatheism. By contrast, a human-inhospitable
environment is not surprising on naturalism, since on that hypothesis, life on
Earth is shaped solely by evolutionary factors, shaping the world into a
hostile place, due to the competition for scarce resources. Therefore, the
datum that the Earth is a human-inhospitable environment provides at least
some confirming evidence for naturalism vis-a-vis blahtheism.

The point of this exercise isn't just to call attention to a piece of
disconfirming evidence against blatheism; it is rather to point out that at
least some data that supports naturalism vis-a-vis supernaturalistic
hypotheses does not reduce to the problem of evil. Evil doesn't play a role
one way or the other in the argument above; rather, (i) facts about rational
omniscience and omnipotence, plus (ii) facts about the god's interests/aims,
and (iii) facts suggesting the aims were not achieved, sufficed to generate
the problem. This was highlighted by the fact that the blatheistic hypothesis
_excludes_ moral properties from the divine nature, and yet we could make
reasonable predictions about what such a being would do, given certain
intentions. **The salient facts here were facts suggesting an aim/outcome
mismatch between God's intentions and the world.**

The moral is that the widely held assumption that most arguments against
theism reduce to the problem of evil is false.

It would take much more work to properly develop and defend the argument, but
briefly, the way I have in mind to use his core point here as evidence against
theism is as follows. If autonomy is required for the flourishing of properly
functioning adult humans, then being a subordinate who lacks privacy to even
their own thoughts is contrary to the flourishing of mature, properly
functioning adult humans, in which case beings made for autonomy of this sort
is prima facie surprising on theism. For one would expect God to create beings
that are capable of flourishing within his universe.  
  
By contrast, the existence of beings with a prima facie rational and fitting
desire for autonomy of this sort is not surprising on naturalism, since on
that hypothesis, there is no such being to which we are subordinate. Rather,
evolution selected for a preference structure that desires this sort of
autonomy -- an autonomy that's compatible with interdependence with similar
creatures, but which favors using one's own judgement for navigating our way
through life when (e.g.) the wisdom of others seems wrong. Beings with a
natural desire or preference of this sort would seem to have an evolutionary
advantage over those that do not, since the wisdom of the group might go wrong
in ways that are contrary to their survival and reproduction. Therefore, the
existence of a prima facie rational and fitting preference for this kind of
autonomy provides at least some confirming evidence for naturalism vis-a-vis
theism.

Here is the core of the argument, which I know you said is brief. "If autonomy
is required for the flourishing of properly functioning adult humans, then
being a subordinate who lacks privacy to even their own thoughts is contrary
to the flourishing of mature, properly functioning adult humans, in which case
beings made for autonomy of this sort is prima facie surprising on theism."  
  
I want to challenge the assumption that there is a threat to autonomy. Suppose
that upon birth, a doctor places a Bluetooth device in a child's head that is
capable of capturing the thoughts and feelings, as much as can be described
with language, and the data is stored on a server somewhere. Let the data be
encrypted and no one knows how to decrypt it. If you want, let it be beyond
the powers of humans to ever discover how to decrypt it, e.g., suppose the
world is coming to a climatastic ending in 10 years and we can't generate a
way to break the encryption within 10 years).  
  
Question: does this person lack autonomy?  
  
Now let a guy in IT get access to the data and he has the key to decrypt it.
He doesn't look.  
  
Question: does this person lack autonomy?  
  
Now let the IT guy actually look at the data.  
  
Question: does this person lack autonomy?  
  
(Btw. if there are concerns about placing Bluetooth in the head, there are
other technologies we can develop to not require that. It is just a useful way
to making mind-reading technologies and the data accessible more plausible.)  
  
I think there are reasons that giving people in IT - especially IT! - access
to this sort of data is concerning, specifically because we know people in IT
are not morally good. I'm kidding. But all those concerns about their moral
goodness remain, which is why their having this access is so concerning (cough
cough Zuckerberg cough). But if we assume moral neutrality or moral goodness
of the individuals with access, then the argument loses it bite. So it seems
to me. Thoughts?

Some things worthy of note. First, there are very many more arguments for
atheism than commonly supposed. Second, while categorization is inevitably
somewhat arbitrary, there are clearly very many more _types_ of atheistic
arguments than commonly supposed -- on my reckoning, 20 other types of
atheistic argument besides the problem of evil. Third, about 120 atheistic
arguments (roughly 75%) have nothing to do with the problem of evil --
problems of evil are in the minority. Fourth, the list doesn't include
arguments specifically against orthodox Christianity. If it did, the list
would be considerably longer. Fifth, the case for atheism doesn't at all
depend on the success of the problem of evil.

Sixth, the evidence against theism appears to be _systemic,_ comprising __
facts about: the nature of _abstracta_ and _concreta_ ; the nature, origin,
and general structure of the universe; the nature, origin, and history of
life; the nature of consciousness; the nature, origin, biology, and psychology
of human beings; the nature, origins, and dynamics of religions and religious
experience; the existence and nature of morality; the meaning of life; the
aesthetics of the universe; epistemic phenomena; the concept of God and the
properties such a god would have; divine hiddenness; evil; etc. In short,
virtually every major aspect of reality and our knowledge of it seems to point
_away_ from theism and towards some form of naturalism. Prima facie, then,
naturalism appears to be a comprehensive theory of reality that best embodies
the theoretical virtues (e.g., simplicity, scope, conservatism, etc.). To
overcome the case for atheism, therefore, theists have much more work to do
besides attacking this or that argument against theism. In particular, theists
need to generate a rival explanation of the data above that embodies the
theoretical virtues better than naturalism. It's not at all clear that they
can succeed.

Finally, it needs to be said that most people who care about arguments for and
against theism are adherents of some form of orthodox religious monotheism or
other. Among such groups, it's typically thought that the case for their faith
must be persuasive, such that no (or almost no) mature, rational, properly
functioning human being who appraised the relevant evidence could non-culpably
fail to believe after assessing it (on the grounds that (i) God holds people
morally responsible for their belief, and (ii) God would be less than
perfectly good if he held people morally responsible for their belief if the
evidence were less than persuasive). Thus, consider some rational, mature,
properly functioning adult agnostic, Joe _,_ who has strongly grasped,
internalized, and carefully appraised the above arguments, as well as all the
arguments for theism on the other side of the ledger. Suppose further that
after long and careful reflection, Joe finds the grounds for atheism to be
either stronger than those for theism, or at best, counterbalanced with them.
Finally, suppose that Joe thereby either disbelieves or suspends judgement
about theism. According to the group of theists specified just above, there
can be no one like Joe: The evidence for orthodox monotheism is _so_ good that
for _any_ person _S,_ if _S_ is a rational, mature, properly functioning
agent, and __ (after careful reflection and deliberation) _S_ fails to find
the evidence to support theism over atheism, or if _S_ merely finds the
evidence to be _counterbalanced_ \-- or indeed, if _S_ finds themself _unable
to tell,_ with any confidence, which way the evidence points -- then _S_ is
_morally culpable_ for failing to believe in the relevant version of orthodox
monotheism. In light of the case for atheism expressed in the arguments listed
above, this looks to be implausible, if not ridiculous.

I knew about "Progressive Atheism". However, I had no idea a second book was
to soon be published as well! Thanks for filling us in!  
Being a cheapskate, I am waiting for the price of the books to go down.
(Although they are actually fairly reasonable to being with) If you plan on
reading the book soon. I'd love to read a review of it!

###  Two Notions of Necessity (and the Theistic Arguments that Conflate Them)

There are two notions of necessity floating around that easily get conflated:
(i) exists in all possible worlds, and (ii) can't not exist. But (ii) can't be
captured by (i); (ii) is more fine-grained than (i). Indeed, it's
epistemically possible that a being is necessary in sense (i), but not in
sense (ii).

To see this, say that a _world stub_ is some initial temporal segment of a
possible world (whether beginningless or not). Now consider that it it's
epistemically possible for a god (an uncreated, metaphysically independent
being) _G_ to exist in the world stub of every possible world, and yet go out
of existence at some time downstream of the world stub of at least one -- but
perhaps many, and perhaps even every -- possible world (say it commits suicide
due to eternal boredom, or it's annihilated by some other being downstream of
one or more world stubs). It's therefore epistemically possible for _G_ to be
necessary in sense (i), but not in sense (ii).

1\. A necessary being exists in at least one possible world.  
  
and then infer from (1) and Axiom S5 of S5 modal logic to infer that

2\. A necessary being exists in every possible world.  
  
And finally, from (2) they infer that

Mandevillian intelligence is prima facie surprising on theism, as individual
intellectual vices seem bad, and something God would want us to eliminate in
ourselves. By contrast, Mandevillian intelligence is unsurprising on
naturalism, as blind evolutionary forces don't "care" about intellectual vice,
but rather about whatever happens to help individuals and groups survive and
reproduce. And clearly such vices can contribute to achieve such an end, as in
the above case. Therefore, Mandevillian intelligence provides at least some
evidence for naturalism vis-a-vis theism.

Ever since at least Russell (1927), many philosophers[1] have argued that
materialism – and, I now point out, classical theism – have an “explanatory
gap” problem of another sort. For science only tells us about the structure
and dynamics of matter -- i.e., its extrinsic, relational properties -- and
not its intrinsic properties[2]. As D.M. Armstrong (1968) put it:

"...[I]f we look at properties of physical objects that physicists are
prepared to allow them, such as mass, electric charge, or momentum, these show
a distressing tendency to dissolve into relations one object has to another.
What, then, are the things that have these relations to each other? Must they
not have a non-relational nature if they are to sustain relations? But what is
this nature? Physics does not tell us." (p. 282)

[1] See, for example, Russell (1927), Strawson (1986), Chalmers (1996),
Stoljar (2006), Pereboom (2011), Alter & Nagasawa (2012), Alter (2016) and
Goff (2017).

[2]Lewis (1986) argued that shape is an intrinsic property of material
objects, but Davidson (2014) has argued persuasively that shape is relative to
a given inertial reference frame.

###  Theism, Substance Dualism, Personal Identity, Evil, and Quantum Mechanics

For example, take standard theistic accounts of substance dualism, and take
the increasingly popular Everettian interpretation of QM (in fact, strictly
speaking, _it's not an interpretation_ : it _just is_ QM). On that account,
humans are constantly branching, hydra-like, into hugely many alternate
universes, at virtually every moment of their lives. But if so, then prima
facie, either (i) only one branch is you, or (ii) they all are you. On (i),
God creates (directly, ex nihilo, or indirectly, through natural processes)
new souls for each branch self at virtually every moment. On (ii), you have
many selves. On either option, the sameness of soul account of personal
identity is starting to look seriously unmotivated.  
  
Furthermore, what are we to make of the afterlife? On (ii), all of your
counterpart branch souls have an existence in an afterlife. Now combine that
with the traditional doctrine of the soul being joined to a physical body at
the final judgement. Prima facie, our world _essentially_ involves QM and
branching universes, in which case ,prima facie, so does any post-resurrection
universe. Prima facie, all of the branching selves will be resurrected in
different alternate universes, with counterpart Christs. On (i), it's hard to
get an intelligible grasp of how all of my branching selves could be "me",
each in their own resurrected bodies in alternate universes.

Furthermore, what are we to make of the person and work of Christ? For
example, Jesus has many branch selves. Which one is the "real" Jesus? One?
Some? All? Presumably, then, there are many Christs, and there will have to be
many crucifixions. From this example, it becomes apparent that a host of other
problems arise for the incarnation, atonement, trinity, and related doctrines.

Finally, there are infinitely many decohering branches of the universal wave
function, such that infinitely many branches contain gratuitous evil.

In short, it looks as though quantum mechanics poses serious problems for both
substance dualism and for theism. In fact, it's looking as though _QM, all by
itself, is incompatible with-- or, at the very least, highly surprising on --
traditional accounts of Christian theism and religious monotheism in general_.
Prima facie, then, QM provides at least strong abductive evidence against
traditional monotheism.

\-----  
[1] The other main revolution in physics is relativistic quantum field theory
(RQFT), according to which fields are more fundamental than particles: what we
call 'particles' are really just field excitations. But that is another can of
worms.

Some things worthy of note. First, there are very many more arguments for
atheism than commonly supposed. Second, while categorization is inevitably
somewhat arbitrary, there are clearly very many more _types_ of atheistic
arguments than commonly supposed -- on my reckoning, 20 other types of
atheistic argument besides the problem of evil. Third, about 120 atheistic
arguments (roughly 75%) have nothing to do with the problem of evil --
problems of evil are in the minority. Fourth, the list doesn't include
arguments specifically against orthodox Christianity. If it did, the list
would be considerably longer. Fifth, the case for atheism doesn't at all
depend on the success of the problem of evil.

Sixth, the evidence against theism appears to be _systemic,_ comprising __
facts about: the nature of _abstracta_ and _concreta_ ; the nature, origin,
and general structure of the universe; the nature, origin, and history of
life; the nature of consciousness; the nature, origin, biology, and psychology
of human beings; the nature, origins, and dynamics of religions and religious
experience; the existence and nature of morality; the meaning of life; the
aesthetics of the universe; epistemic phenomena; the concept of God and the
properties such a god would have; divine hiddenness; evil; etc. In short,
virtually every major aspect of reality and our knowledge of it seems to point
_away_ from theism and towards some form of naturalism. Prima facie, then,
naturalism appears to be a comprehensive theory of reality that best embodies
the theoretical virtues (e.g., simplicity, scope, conservatism, etc.). To
overcome the case for atheism, therefore, theists have much more work to do
besides attacking this or that argument against theism. In particular, theists
need to generate a rival explanation of the data above that embodies the
theoretical virtues better than naturalism. It's not at all clear that they
can succeed.

Finally, it needs to be said that most people who care about arguments for and
against theism are adherents of some form of orthodox religious monotheism or
other. Among such groups, it's typically thought that the case for their faith
must be persuasive, such that no (or almost no) mature, rational, properly
functioning human being who appraised the relevant evidence could non-culpably
fail to believe after assessing it (on the grounds that (i) God holds people
morally responsible for their belief, and (ii) God would be less than
perfectly good if he held people morally responsible for their belief if the
evidence were less than persuasive). Thus, consider some rational, mature,
properly functioning adult agnostic, Joe _,_ who has strongly grasped,
internalized, and carefully appraised the above arguments, as well as all the
arguments for theism on the other side of the ledger. Suppose further that
after long and careful reflection, Joe finds the grounds for atheism to be
either stronger than those for theism, or at best, counterbalanced with them.
Finally, suppose that Joe thereby either disbelieves or suspends judgement
about theism. According to the group of theists specified just above, there
can be no one like Joe: The evidence for orthodox monotheism is _so_ good that
for _any_ person _S,_ if _S_ is a rational, mature, properly functioning
agent, and __ (after careful reflection and deliberation) _S_ fails to find
the evidence to support theism over atheism, or if _S_ merely finds the
evidence to be _counterbalanced_ \-- or indeed, if _S_ finds themself _unable
to tell,_ with any confidence, which way the evidence points -- then _S_ is
_morally culpable_ for failing to believe in the relevant version of orthodox
monotheism. In light of the case for atheism expressed in the arguments listed
above, this looks to be implausible, if not ridiculous.

Peter van Inwagen (1983: 202–4) presented a powerful argument against the
Principle of Sufficient Reason, which I henceforth abbreviate as ‘PSR’. For
decades, the consensus was that this argument successfully refuted PSR.
However, now a growing consensus holds that van Inwagen’s argument is fatally
flawed, at least when ‘sufficient reason’ is understood in terms of ground,
for on this understanding, an ineliminable premiss of van Inwagen’s argument
is demonstrably false and cannot be repaired. I will argue that this growing
consensus is mistaken and that a powerful argument relevantly similar to van
Inwagen’s should still concern us, even when we understand ‘sufficient reason’
in terms of ground.

###  Wave Function Realism, The Unreliability of Perception, and Theism

Now according to many theists, if God exists, then God designed us in such a
way as to ensure that our perceptual faculties reliably track the truth about
the world, where this includes beliefs about the ordinary objects of
experience having extension in length, width, and depth. But if the above
worry is at all on track, then ordinary perceptual experience is massively
unreliable. And if that's right, then something has to give: either (i) theism
is false, or (ii) the existence of the God of theism doesn't make it likely
that our perceptual faculties are reliable. The first disjunct is of course
fatal to theism. The second might well be equally so, given a few more
premises concerning God's omni-attributes and a bridge principle from those
attributes to the reliability of sense perception. However, even if this can't
be done, the second disjunct still causes trouble for a number of theistic
apologetic strategies. For example, it would be devastating to Plantinga's
theory of warranted Christian belief. Either way, then, if the growing chorus
is onto something, troubling epistemic consequences for theism follow.

###  Notes on Ruloff's Papers on Arguments from Propositions and
Intentionality to God

In this paper, Ruloff critiques Anderson and Welty’s argument from
intentionality to God. Ruloff expresses their argument as follows:

> P1: The laws of logic are propositions.
>
> P2: Propositions bear intrinsic intentionality.
>
> P3: Therefore, the laws of logic are propositions that bear intrinsic
> intentionality. (From P1 and P2)
>
> P4: x is intrinsically intentional only if x is mental (or mind-dependent).
>
> P5: Therefore, the laws of logic are propositions that are mental (or mind-
> dependent). (From P3 and P4)
>
> P6: The laws of logic exist necessarily.
>
> P7: If the laws of logic exist necessarily and are mental, then the laws of
> logic are the contents of a necessarily existent mind.
>
> P8: Therefore, the laws of logic are the contents of a necessarily existent
> mind. (From P5, P6, and P7)
>
> P9: Therefore, a necessarily existent mind exists. (From P8)

Ruloff offers a defeater for P4, i.e., against the thesis that intentional
entities must depend upon a mind. Toward that end, he sketches a standard
account of propositions: Fregean Propositional Realism (FPR), according to
which propositions are mind-independent abstract objects that are
intrinsically and essentially intentional, and yet wholly independent of any
and all minds. Officially:

> Fregean propositional realism (FPR): Propositions are abstract, mind and
> language-independent, truth-bearing, representational entities, that
> function as the referents of propositional attitude reports and the meanings
> of declarative sentence-tokens.

Crucially, it is widely held that there is a straightforward argument for
their intrinsic and essential intentionality, viz., propositions are the
primary bearers of truth-values, and their truth-values are simply a function
of their correspondence with the world (or lack thereof). Indeed, on FPR, the
intentionality of thought is derivative of/dependent upon the intentionality
of propositions, and not the other way around.

Ruloff offers two main arguments for FPR that are commonly given and widely
accepted. The first is the “singular term” argument (STA). According to STA,
in sentences containing “that”-clauses e.g., “Joe believes that the ball is
red.” – the “that”-clause is most naturally taken to be a singular term that
is a referring expression. Prima facie, then, there is something to which
“that”-clauses refer. But the most plausible candidates for such referents are
mind-independent, abstract objects.

The second argument is that the robust theoretical utility of FPR confers
justification on the view. For example, it explains how (a) “the same semantic
content can be expressed by different people uttering different sentence-
tokens in different languages”; (b) “how the same semantic content can be
believed by different people”; (c) “how mental states gain their
representational content”; and (d) “makes intuitive sense of our ascriptions
of truth and falsity”; etc.

Given that FPR is a well-motivated view and that it entails that propositions
are essentially intentional entities and yet mind-independent, P4 is undercut.

  
In this paper, Ruloff evaluates Gould’s argument that propositions are caused
by/grounded in a (divine) mind:

> 1\. Propositions bear intrinsic intentionality.
>
> 2\. X is intentional only if x is mental.
>
> 3\. Therefore, propositions are mental (mental entities or mental states).
>
> 4\. If propositions are mental, then they are thoughts.
>
> 5\. Therefore, propositions are thoughts.
>
> 6\. If propositions are thoughts, then they are effects of some mind.
>
> 7\. Therefore, propositions are the effects of some mind.

Ruloff’s core claim is that (3) is subject to a _reductio_ , entailing four
assumptions that are widely rejected on grounds of implausibility: (i) had
there never been any mental states, then there would be no true or false
propositions; (ii) the total number of true and false propositions must equal
the total number of mental states; (iii) it’s impossible for two people to
believe the same proposition or share the same thought; and (iv) some
propositions will fail to have contradictories. But if so, then there are
grounds for rejecting (1) or (2) (or both).

(i) is implausible because it’s a prima facie false counterfactual or
counterpossible: propositions would be true or false even if no one
entertained them. (cf. McGrath (2012), Soames (1999), Jubien (1997), Swartz &
Dowden (2004), etc.). The following counterfactual/counterpossible is even
more salient: If there were no beings capable of mental states, “There are no
beings capable of mental states” would’ve still been true ; (ii) is
implausible because prima facie, there are many – infinitely many – more
propositions than mental states; (iii) is implausible because propositions can
be entertained by -- be “in” -- more than one mind at once, while mental
states are concrete particulars, located in discrete regions of space and
time, and no concrete particular can be in more than one region of space and
time at once (cf. Frege); and (iv) is implausible because there seem to be
propositions that at most one person has ever thought of. But if so, then if
propositions are mental states, then no one will have thought of the
contradictories of such propositions. But it’s absurd to think that some
propositions don’t have contradictories. Therefore, propositions can’t be
mental states. Until Gould addresses these implausibilities, his theistic
conceptualism has undefeated defeaters.

__“On Propositional Platonism, Representation, and Divine Conceptualism”,
_EJPR_ 8:4 (Winter 2016): 195-212.__

In this paper, Ruloff critiques Gould & Davis’ critique of propositional
platonism in favor of theistic conceptualism. In particular, Ruloff argues
that their argument relies upon at least five implausible assumptions: (i)
propositions must be representational in order to be the bearers of truth-
values; (ii) propositions are abstract entities whose constituent components
are properties, relations, and concrete individuals (i.e., that propositions
are to be given a Russellian analysis); (iii) propositions are structured
abstract entities; (iv) a proposition’s truth-conditions must be explained
solely in terms of the representational properties of its constituent
components; and (v) if the propositional platonist isn’t able to explain the
representational properties of a proposition in terms of its constituents, a
wholesale rejection of propositional platonism is justified.

Against (i): Jeff Speaks’ account of propositions analyzes them in terms of
properties. On Speaks’ account, “The ball is red” is true just in case the
property _being such that the ball is red_ is instantiated. But if so, then
propositions can be bearers of truth-values without being inherently
representational entities. Absent a successful critique of Speaks' account,
(i) is undercut.

Against (ii): (a) Fregean accounts of propositions take the constituents to be
structured senses, or modes of presentation, and not properties, relations,
and individuals; and (b) Moorean accounts of propositions take them to be
structured concepts/open sentences plus gap-filling expressions. Absent a
successful critique of these accounts, (ii) is undercut.

Against (iii): (a) George Bealer has a well-developed and defended account of
whole propositions as unstructured, metaphysically simple, ontologically
primitive, _sui generis_ abstracta. These simple entities are associated with
a decomposition tree, and thus structure can be attributed to propositions in
this _derivative_ way; (b) Robert Stalnaker has a well-developed and defended
account of propositions as sets of possible worlds, or functions from possible
worlds to truth-values. Example: the proposition expressed by “Jen is a
philosopher” is the set of worlds in which the referent of 'Jen'  is a member
of the set of things that are philosophers. Equivalently, it’s the function
_f_ that maps a possible worlds _w_ to the value _True_ just in case Jen is a
philosopher in _w_ ; (c) Keller & Keller have recently argued that the
principle of compositionality is false, as it admits of counterexamples or
rests on several very controversial assumptions. Absent a successful critique
of these accounts and K & K's apparent counterexamples, (iii) is undercut.

Against (iv): we've seen above that (a) Jeff Speaks has a well-developed and
defended account of propositions as properties that entails that propositions
are not representational at all, in which case they lack representational
components; (b) Bealer’s and Stalnaker’s accounts of propositions entail that
their truth-conditions don’t depend on simpler and structured parts; and (c)
Keller & Keller’s arguments provide an undercutting defeater for the claim
that propositions have internal components as constituents (cf. their
arguments against the principle of compositionality). Absent a successful
critique of these, (iv) is undercut.

Against (v): Even if the propositional platonist can’t explain how an abstract
proposition can get its representational features from its constituents,
propositional platonism would still be rationally justified. This is because
of the widely endorsed theoretical utility argument for propositional
platonism. According to the argument, because the view “elegantly and
powerfully simplifies, unifies, and systematizes our thinking about language
and communication, a commitment to propositional platonism is warranted.” (p.
209). For example, it explains (a) how the same semantic content can be
expressed by different people uttering the different sentence tokens of
different languages; (b) how the same semantic content can be believed by
different people; (c) how mental states gain their representational content;
(d) alethic modality (possibility, necessity, contingency, etc.); and (e) our
ascriptions of truth and falsity. As Michael Jubien argues, given the
impressively strong theoretical utility argument, we should “try to get used
to the mystery” of how propositions can be intrinsically representational
entities (Jubien 1997, p. 103). She is therefore warranted in taking the
representational properties of propositions to be a theoretical primitive.
Absent a successful critique of this argument, (v) is undercut.

###  A Weaker Version of the Principle of Material Causality Yields the Same
Conclusion

Recent versions of the cosmological argument deploy weaker causal and
explanatory principles to make them more plausible: Perhaps the evidence isn't
strong enough to support the claim that, necessarily (or at least, actually),
every object or state of affairs (or some proper subclass thereof) has a
sufficient reason or efficient cause of their existence or obtaining. And
perhaps such principles beg the question against the atheist by assuming the
causal or explanatory structure of a theistic universe. But surely (so the
thought goes) the atheist's intuitive evidence supports the weaker claim that
everything _can_ have an efficient cause or sufficient reason. Such arguments
go on from there to argue that a theistic conclusion can be gotten from such
weaker principles.

In the same spirit, I think the principle of material causality can be
weakened so as to be adequately supported by even the theist's intuitive
evidence:

> Weak PMC: Possibly, every concrete object (and aggregate of such) that has
> an originating or sustaining efficient cause has an originating or
> sustaining material cause, respectively.

In simple terms, Weak PMC says that it is _possible_ that all _made_ things
are made _from_ or _out of_ other things. A bit more carefully, it says that
there is at least one possible world in which all concrete individuals and
stuffs that are made are made from or out of other concrete individuals or
stuffs.  
  
Now my own view is that a much stronger version of PMC is true -- viz., that
it holds of metaphysical necessity. However, I'd be willing to bet that most
people believe that PMC is non-vacuously true in at least the _actual_ world,
and for good reason: it's intuitive, it has no uncontroversial exceptions, and
it's encoded in the well-confirmed conservation laws of physics. _A fortiori_
, then, I think that even the theist has enough intuitive evidence to warrant
the claim that there is at least one possible world _W_ in which such a
principle is non-vacuously true. But if so, then in _W_ , there are concrete
objects that are made, and all concrete objects that are _made_ are made _out
of_ other things or stuff. And if so, then _no_ concrete objects in _W_ that
are made are __ made _ex nihilo_ , in which case no god or gods made them _ex
nihilo_ in _W_. But on classical Anselmian theism, for _any_ world that
contains concrete objects or stuffs distinct from God, at least _some_ of
those objects or stuffs were made _ex nihilo_. It follows that the god of
classical Anselmian theism doesn't exist in _W_. But if so, then by (i) the
fact that classical Anselmian theism entails that God is a metaphysically
necessary being, and (ii) Axiom S5 of S5 modal logic, it follows that such a
God doesn't exist in the _actual_ world, either.  
  
Therefore, one can generate a successful argument from material causality
against theism with even a very weak version of PMC. How powerful of an
argument is it?  
  
Very powerful, I'd say. To see this, consider the following line of reasoning.
Leaving aside formal and final causes, there appear to be four possible
scenarios for causal principles that govern a universe:  

(i) Both an efficient cause principle and a material cause principle

(iv) Neither an efficient cause principle nor a material cause principle

Here's the rub: our grounds for a material cause principle are at least as
strong as our grounds for an efficient cause principle (I would say they're
stronger for a material cause, as there appear to be counterexamples to the
efficient cause principle in cases of certain quantum phenomena). But if so,
then starting from the neutral standpoint of agnosticism, there is a default
presumption in favor of (i) as one's epistemic starting point. Rejecting it in
favor of one of the other three options therefore requires adequate grounds
for doing so. But it's unproblematic for the atheist to start at (i). By
contrast, the theist has their work cut out for them: They must find grounds
to reject (i) in favor of (ii). But prima facie, it looks like no such grounds
can be forthcoming. For prima facie, any argument for theism will run afoul of
Weak PMC, as Weak PMC blocks cosmological, ontological, and design arguments,
and arguments from substance dualism as arguments for _theism_ (as opposed to
arguments for, at best, pantheism, panentheism, and demiurgism). It therefore
looks as though the argument from material causality holds out the promise (or
peril) of constituting an intrinsic defeater-defeater against classical
Anselmian theism.

By contrast, it's not obvious to me that the same can be said of the standard
arguments for atheism. For such arguments seem to be resistible if the theist
can provide other grounds for theism, such as those mentioned above. But the
problem is that, unlike the argument from material causality, the arguments
from evil and hiddenness can't hamstring those arguments. It therefore seems
to me that the argument from material causality holds out the prospect of
being the most powerful argument against theism.

The argument from material causality also has other epistemic functions that
are slightly weaker, yet still important. First, it can show that the theist
incurs a theoretical cost by rejecting Weak PMC, as it seems to be supported
by just about anyone's intuitive evidence (at least prior to reflecting on its
implications and revising one's web of beliefs). Second, it can function as an
undercutting defeater for the newer versions of cosmological arguments
mentioned at the beginning of our discussion.

In at least these ways, then, it seems to me that the argument from material
causality is very powerful indeed.

###  Notes on Morriston's "Creation Ex Nihilo and the Big Bang"

1.1 According to the Big Bang theory, the universe began with a great
explosion from an infinitely dense point-particle.

1.4 Therefore, the Big Bang theory requires that the universe had a beginning
and was created out of nothing.

2.1.2.1 Nothingness can’t begin expanding, since there is nothing there to
expand. By contrast, the “point-universe” began expanding.

2.1.2.2 Even if the point-universe lacks spatial and temporal spread, it yet
has other properties, e.g., being a point, being infinitely dense, being
capable of expanding, etc.

2.2.1 Compare: (a) There can be no round squares; therefore, (b) 'round
square'; is synonymous with 'nothing'.

2.2.2 In general, from the fact that there can be no entity E, it doesn’t
follow that ‘E’ is synonymous with ‘nothing’.

2.2.3 Therefore, even if there can be no infinitely dense point-universe, it
doesn’t follow that ‘infinitely dense point-universe' is synonymous with
‘nothing’

**2.3 Third,** **if nothing can be infinitely dense, then the universe was
never infinitely dense**

2.3.1 But if so, then premise 1 is false as stated

2.3.1.1 Either we change Craig’s description of what the Big Bang theory says,
so that it doesn’t involve a state of infinite density, or we don’t

2.3.1.2 if we do, then the argument loses its basis for inferring that the
universe was created out of nothing

2.3.1.3 If we don’t, then the criticism above (viz., that if (2) is true, then
(1) is false) goes through

**2.4 Fourth, few Big Bang cosmologists today think the universe was ever
infinitely dense and point-sized**

2.4.1 It’s true that, on the standard Big Bang model, the geometry of the
universe’s expansion, when traced backward in time, continually decreases
toward a limit of a diameter of zero

2.4.2 However, the limit diameter zero is thought of as an _ideal_ , and not
an _actual_ , limit

2.4.3 Furthermore, we have no theory that allows us to infer the universe’s
behavior as we approach this limit

2.4.3.1 Relativity theory breaks down prior to Planck time (i.e.,
10-43seconds), and quantum effects become dominant prior to that point

2.4.3.2 we need a quantum theory of gravity (which we don’t yet have) to
accurately infer what happened prior to Planck time

2.4.3.3 Until then, any claim about the earliest stage of our universe’s
history is “sheer speculation”

3 **. Craig’s Second Argument: No Time Prior to the Singularity Entails
Creation _Ex Nihilo_**

3.1 The initial singularity exists at the earliest point of space-time.

3.2 There is no time prior to the earliest point of space-time.

3.3 Therefore, there was nothing temporally prior to the initial singularity.

3.4 So, the initial singularity must have come into existence out of nothing.

3.5 If, therefore, the initial singularity was created, it must have been
created out of nothing

**4.1 First, the Big Bang theory doesn’t entail that there was no time “prior”
the singularity**

4.1.1 Craig himself has argued that it’s possible that there is a more
fundamental “metaphysical time” that can exist independently of the physical
time of our universe.

4.1.2 Craig’s thought experiment: Suppose God led up to creation by counting
“1, 2, 3, … fiat lux!”

4.1.3 In this scenario, time is elapsing, and yet no physical objects exist.
Its moments are individuated by the succession of contents in God’s mind.

4.1.4 Craig thinks this thought experiment shows that a time “prior” to
physical time is metaphysically possible.

4.1.5 In fact, given Craig’s theism, he thinks this metaphysical time is
_actual_

4.1.6 According to Craig, metaphysical time is absolute, tensed, and dynamic

4.1.7 But if so, then Craig’s view of metaphysical time entails the
metaphysical possibility of time prior to the Big Bang singularity

4.1.8 The epistemic possibility of metaphysical time prior to the singularity
is thus an undercutting defeater for premise 2

**4.2 Second, there being nothing _temporally_ prior to the singularity
doesn’t entail there being nothing _causally_ or _ontologically_ prior to the
singularity**

4.2.1 What follows from (3) is not (4), but rather the weaker claim that the
universe didn’t come from something that existed _at an earlier time_. It's
therefore compatible with the possibility of the universe created from
_timeless_ stuff

4.2.2 To close the logical gap between (3) and (4), then, we need another
premise, viz.,

(3 ½) If there was nothing temporally prior to the initial singularity, then
it must have come into existence out of nothing.

4.2.2.1 Craig is already committed to saying that, ontologically prior to the
singularity, _God_ exists timelessly

4.2.2.2 It’s therefore not clear what principled grounds he could have to rule
out the epistemic possibility that, causally and/or ontologically prior to the
singularity, _other things besides God_ exist timelessly (e.g., a timeless
stuff from which the universe was made)

4.2.2.3 And if that’s right, it’s not clear how Craig can rule out the
epistemic possibility that God created the universe out of a timeless stuff

4.2.2.4 Therefore, even if there was no time prior to the singularity, it
doesn’t follow that God created the universe out of nothing

4.2.3 Anticipated reply: Craig thinks he can rule out the epistemic
possibility of timeless stuff because he thinks: (a) the only possible stuff
from which God could make the universe is matter/energy; (b) timeless stuff is
quiescent; and (c) matter/energy is never quiescent.

4.2.4 Rejoinder: it’s not clear that (a) is true: it’s epistemically possible
that God created the universe out of some timeless stuff that’s distinct from
matter/energy

4.2.5 **Third, the grounds for a requirement of a timeless _efficient_ cause
of the universe is on an epistemic par with the grounds for a requirement of a
timeless _material_ cause**

4.2.5.1.2 Both enjoy strong empirical confirmation [N.B., actually, the case
for material causes is stronger, given apparent counterexamples to the need
for efficient causes in quantum mechanical phenomena. --EA]

4.2.5.2.1 We’ve never observed timeless stuff, but we’ve never observed a
timeless person, either.

4.2.5.2.2 It’s odd to think that the material cause of the universe was
timeless _sans_ creation, and then entered time with its creation, but then
Craig thinks the same is true of the efficient cause of the universe: God is
timeless _sans_ creation, but entered time at the moment of creation

4.2.5.3 Given epistemic parity, we have a dilemma: Either our commonsense
intuitions about ordinary cases of causation can reasonably applied to the
beginning of the universe or they can’t. If they can, then creation of the
universe out of timeless stuff is more plausible than creation _ex nihilo_. If
they can’t, then we can’t draw any conclusion whatever about the existence and
nature of the cause of the universe. Either way, Craig’s argument fails

###  Notes: Assessing The Case for an Apocalyptic Jesus in Ehrman’s Jesus:
Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium

**Notes: Assessing The Case for an Apocalyptic Jesus in Ehrman’s _Jesus:
Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium_**

-Scholars use criteria of authenticity to sift the earliest sources with eyewitness testimony to reconstruct the historical Jesus

-Applying these results yields seven general lines of evidence that Jesus was an apocalyptic prophet:

  * #1: The earliest sources portray Jesus as an apocalyptic prophet

  * #2 The later sources tone down the apocalyptic language in the earlier sources

  * #3: Those connected to Jesus and his message before and after his earthly ministry were apocalypticists

  * #4: The apocalyptic prophet hypothesis makes best sense of his core teachings

  * #5 The apocalyptic prophet hypothesis makes best sense of his ethical teachings

  * #6: The apocalyptic prophet hypothesis makes best sense of his actions

  * #7: The apocalyptic prophet hypothesis makes best sense of his last days 

-Ehrman’s argument is best construed as an inference to the best explanation

  * Inferences to the best explanation proceed by listing a range of data, and arguing that one competing hypothesis best explains that data

  * A hypothesis is the best explanation of the data to the extent that it exemplifies the theoretical virtues (simplicity, scope, conservatism, predictive power, etc.) better than any competing theory

-Call the hypothesis that Jesus was an apocalyptic prophet, _Apocalyptic Prophet_

1\. If Apocalyptic Prophet is the best explanation of the relevant data, then
Jesus was probably an apocalyptic prophet.

2\. Apocalyptic Prophet is the best explanation of the relevant data (cf. 1-7
above)

-The key premise is (2): the Apocalyptic Prophet hypothesis is the best explanation of the relevant data.

  * What standards does an explanation have to meet to be the best? 

  * Does the Apocalyptic Jesus hypothesis meet those standards better than any competing hypothesis?

-In the type of case at hand, predictive power and related theoretical virtues aren't all that relevant, as we're evaluating hypotheses that explain past facts, and not future phenomena. Determining which hypothesis is the best explanation therefore largely boils down to the following three:

  * 1\. **Simplicity** : One hypothesis is simpler than another if the former adds fewer new assumptions than the latter to explain the data.

  * 2\. **Scope** : One hypothesis has wider explanatory scope than another if the former explains more data than the latter.

  * 3\. **Conservatism** : One hypothesis is more conservative than another if the former requires throwing out fewer of our prior beliefs than the other that are already well-justified.

-In short, then: the simplest, most conservative hypothesis that has the widest explanatory scope is the best explanation of the historical Jesus, and is thus the most probable one.

-The consensus view: The Apocalyptic Jesus hypothesis best explains the relevant data, viz., at least the seven discussed in Ehrman’s book (cf. Sanders, Vermes, Fredriksen, et al.)

-If they are better explainations, then they must meet the criteria above (and perhaps others) better than The Apocalyptic Prophet hypothesis.

-The main obstacle with such approaches is that they have trouble explaining all the early, multiply-attested data for this hypothesis discussed in Ehrman’s book. Let’s briefly look at how they aim to do so:

A. **_Divide and Conquer_ **(Craig Blomberg, et al.): the strategy is to take
the group of passages that seem to have Jesus saying the apocalypse is
imminent (i.e., that it would occur within his generation), and provide an
alternative interpretation for each one (e.g., when Jesus said that his
generation wouldn't pass away before the apocalypse happened, what he really
meant was that the Jews wouldn't pass away before it happened. When Jesus said
that his earliest disciples wouldn't finish preaching to the surrounding
cities of Israel before the end happened, he was really referring to the
perennially incomplete task of evangelism to the Jews; etc., etc..)

B. **_Destruction of the Temple_ **(NT Wright, et al.): the strategy is to
argue that, yes, Jesus really did predict the end within his generation, i.e.,
we should take those passages at face-value. However, all the end-time
passages were fulfilled with the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D.

C. **_Possible End Only_** (Ben Witherington, et al.): the strategy is to
assert that what Jesus really meant in all those passages is that the End
*might* be at hand, not that it *is* at hand.

A. _J_ ** _esus Didn't Say That:_** (Raymond Brown et al.): the strategy is to
say that all the passages that have Jesus preach the imminent coming of the
apocalypse are inauthentic -- i.e., Jesus didn't say those things; they were
attributed to Jesus by the early church. However, Jesus is the Son of God.

B. **_Jesus Said it, and He Was Wrong. But So What!_** (Dale Allison, C.S.
Lewis et al.): the strategy is to admit that the passages where Jesus predicts
an imminent end are authentic, and to admit that he was wrong -- the End
didn't happen -- but to say that it has no serious implications for the truth
of Christianity. Jesus is still the Son of God.

**_Jesus Wasn't an Apocalypticist_** (Crossan, Mack, et al.): the strategy is
a variation on the Jesus Didn't Say That response of the Moderates. The
strategy is to argue that all those passages that have Jesus preach the
imminent coming of the apocalypse are inauthentic -- i.e., Jesus didn't say
those things; they were attributed to Jesus by the early church. However,
Jesus wasn't the Son of God, either -- at least not in any literal sense.
Rather, he was a social reformer, a revolutionary, a sage philosopher, or some
variant of thereof.

  * Determine which hypothesis is the simplest, most conservative hypothesis with the widest explanatory scope

-The consensus view: hypothesis that Jesus was primarily an apocalyptic prophet (cf. Sanders, Vermes, Fredriksen, Ehrman, etc.)

-Why? The other proposals mentioned above seem to be more complex (i.e., they add new assumptions to explain the same data), have less explanatory scope (i.e., they can’t explain all seven lines of data as well, and sometimes not at all), and/or less conservative (i.e., they require that we throw out some of the seven lines of data discussed in Ehrman’s book).

**Conclusion:** It therefore looks as though Ehrman is correct: the most
probable hypothesis is that Jesus was primarily an apocalyptic prophet of an
imminent eschaton.

###  Notes: Chapter 12 of Ehrman's _Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New
Millennium_

**Notes: Ch. 12 of Ehrman’s _Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New
Millennium_**

_Thesis_ : Jesus’ visit to Jerusalem, and his subsequent arrest, trial, and
execution, are best explained in terms of his acocalyptic message and actions.

1\. Jesus’ trip to Jerusalem for the Passover Celebration, and his subsequent
activities there, are best explained in terms of his apocalyptic message and
his perceived role in proclaiming it.

2\. Jesus went to the temple during the Passover Festival, and spent many days
teaching about his apocalyptic message of the imminent coming kingdom of God.
-The apocalyptic message included the idea that the temple in Jerusalem would
also be destroyed.

3\. Jesus’ also caused a disturbance in the temple itself, which appears to
have been a symbolic enactment of his apocalyptic teaching about the temple’s
destruction.

4\. Jesus’ teaching and disturbance in the temple during the Passover put
Jesus on the Sadducee’s radar. They were ready to have him arrested, as they
thought he might tip the scales of high political tension that regularly
exists during the Passover due to silent protests (see ch. 7).

5\. Jesus’ betrayal by Judas Iscariot, and Jesus’ subsequent arrest, is best
explained in terms of Judas’ betraying to the religious authorities (the
Sadducees and the chief priests) Jesus’ teaching (to his inner circle of
disciples) that he would be the King of the Jews in the coming Kingdom of God.

6\. Jesus was executed on the charge of political sedition, due to his claim
that he was the King of the Jews. His execution was therefore directly related
to his apocalyptic message of the imminent coming of the kingdom of God.

Millennium_

**Notes: Ch. 11 of Ehrman’s _Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New

1\. Jesus’ baptism and discipleship, and his ringing endorsement of John and
his message throughout Jesus’ ministry, indicates that he accepted his
apocalyptic message. In fact, Jesus’ message was virtually the same as John’s.

2\. Jesus’ calling of twelve disciples is apocalyptic. They represented the
twelve tribes of Israel that would be restored with the coming kingdom of God.
Jesus said that they would be rulers and judges of the twelve tribes when the
kingdom of God came to Earth.

3\. Jesus’ base followers were all considered to represent the “bottom” of
society in his day: the poor, sinners, prostitutes, outcasts, tax collectors,
lepers, and the demon-possessed. This is perfectly in line with the standard
apocalyptic doctrine of the reversal of fortunes when the kingdom of God
comes: “the first shall be last, and the last shall be first”.

4\. Jesus performed many exorcisms, which he claimed marked the inbreaking of
the kingdom of God on Earth. They were thus signs of the imminent apocalypse.
Satan and his minions were being cast out of power, and God’s power was taking
its place.

###  Notes: Chapter 9 of Ehrman's _Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New
Millennium_

**Notes: Ch. 9 of Ehrman’s _Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New
Millennium_**

Key Thesis: The apocalyptic prophet hypothesis makes best sense of Jesus’ core
teachings.

**1\. Jesus message to repent and prepare for the imminent coming of the
kingdom of God is apocalyptic**

  * The righteous will enter and the wicked will be cast out into Gehenna 

  * There will be eating and drinking within it 

  * The twelve disciples will sit on twelve thrones and judge/rule the twelve tribes of Israel. -God will extend his heavenly rule to Earth by means of it 

  * People need to repent to avoid it 

  * It will be meted out by the Son of Man, who is a cosmic judge sent from God (cf. the Book of Daniel in the OT). 

  * The Son of Man will come on the clouds of heaven with God’s holy angels. 

  * It will be accompanied with signs in heaven and on Earth (sun darkened, moon turned to blood, etc.) 

**3\. Jesus’ frequent references to the Son of Man are commonly referring to

Millennium_

**Notes: Chapter 8 of Ehrman’s _Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New
Millennium_** _  
_

-Historical Jesus scholars reconstruct the most probable account of who Jesus was by (i) finding the earliest sources with eyewitness information, and then (ii) using objective criteria to determine which units of material within these sources are probably authentic.

  * The earliest sources are Paul’s letters, Q, Mark, M, and L.

  * Later, less reliable sources that may have some eyewitness information are the canonical gospel of John, and the non-canonical gospels of Peter and of Thomas.

-The criteria applied to these sources are (i) early strata, (ii) lack of theological adornment, (iii) absence of author bias, (iv) multiple attestation, (v) dissimilarity, and (vi)contextual credibility

-The material from these sources that can be verified by these criteria are then used to reconstruct an account of who Jesus probably was, and what he probably said and did

  * #1: The earliest sources portray Jesus as an apocalyptic prophet

  * #2 The later sources tone down the apocalyptic language in the earlier sources

  * #3: Those connected to Jesus and his message before and after his earthly ministry were apocalypticists

**First Line of Evidence: The earliest sources portray Jesus as an apocalyptic
prophet**

  * Multiple attestation: Attested in Mark, Q, M, L (also: Paul’s letters)

  * Embarrassment: Jesus’s false prediction of the apocalypse within his generation goes against the aims of the early church

  * Contextual credibility: there were a number of apocalyptic prophets in Jesus’s time, and it was a popular view among Jews at the time

**Second Line of Evidence: The later sources tone down the apocalyptic
language in the earlier sources**

  * Matthew, Luke, John and Thomas progressively change, remove, or repudiate Jesus’ prediction of an imminent apocalypse in Mark and Q (128-132)

  * Lk 9:27 mutes Jesus prediction of imminence in Mk 9:1; see also Lk 11:20, 17:21

  * Lk 22:69 mutes Jesus prediction of imminence in Mk 14:62

  * Jn almost completely eliminates Jesus’s message of an imminent arrival of the kingdom of God through the Son of Man and replaces it with talk of eternal life through belief in Jesus

  * Thomas repudiates Jesus’s message of an imminent apocalypse (saying 113)

  * This pattern of progressively watering down Jesus’ prediction of an imminent apocalypse makes perfect sense if Jesus really did predict it, and his followers muted the message when his predictions didn’t come true

**Third Line of Evidence: Those connected to Jesus and his message before and
after his earthly ministry were apocalypticists**

  * Before his ministry, Jesus associated with and was baptized by an apocalyptic prophet: John the Baptist (multiple independent attestation, embarrassment)

  * After his death, his earliest followers and the early church were apocalypticists (multiple independent attestation, early strata: Paul’s letters: I Thess. 4:13-18; I Cor. 15:51-57)

  * The apocalyptic teachings associated with Jesus both before and after his ministry are best explained if he himself was an apocalypticist

**Bringing it All Together: The Core Case for an Apocalyptic Jesus**

-Scholars use criteria of authenticity to sift the earliest sources with eyewitness testimony to reconstruct the historical Jesus

-Applying these results yields three main lines of evidence that Jesus was an apocalyptic prophet:

  * #1: The earliest sources portray Jesus as an apocalyptic prophet

  * #2 The later sources tone down the apocalyptic language in the earlier sources

  * #3: Those connected to Jesus and his message before and after his earthly ministry were apocalypticists

###  Notes: Chapter 7 of Ehrman's _Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New
Millennium_

**Notes: Ehrman’s _Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium_ , Chapter
7**

The aim of the chapter is to provide sufficient historical context of 1st
century Palestine to help interpret the words and deeds of Jesus. This, in
turn, will help us apply the criterion of contextual credibility discussed in
ch. 6.

-The Israelites believed that God delivered them from the Egyptians and gave them their land. Yahweh was their God, and he was taken to have made a covenant with them: to protect and defend them, in the land that he had given them, in exchange for their devotion.

-Problem: Israel was subsequently dominated by foreign rulers for 800 years. 

  * The Northern kingdom of Israel was conquered by the **Assyrians** in 721 BCE. 

  * The Southern kingdom of Judah was conquered by the **Babylonians** in 587-586 BCE. Jerusalem was leveled, the Temple was destroyed, and the leaders were taken into exile. 

  * About 50 years later, the Babylonians were overthrown by the **Persians**. The Persians ended the forced exile and allowed the leaders of Judea to return home. The Temple was then rebuilt, and the High Priest was given jurisdiction as a local ruler. Still, the Persian king had final authority. The Persians ruled over the kingdom of Judah for about 200 years. 

  * Then, **Alexander the Great** , ruler of Macedonia, overthrew the Persians and took control of the land, and much of the surrounding area. He spread the Greek language, religion, and culture throughout his new empire, including Israel. 

  * Alexander the Great died in 323 BCE. His generals then divided up his realm, and Palestine came to be ruled by **Ptolemy** , the general in charge of Egypt. 

  * In 198 CE, **the ruler of Syria** wrested control of Palestine from Ptolemy. 

  * A subsequent Persian ruler, **Antiochus Epiphanes** , sought to bring a stronger unity to his empire. Part of his plan involved requiring his subjects to adopt many aspects of Greek culture. While many Jews embraced this move for Hellenization, many Jews found this to be a deep offense to their religious life. In response, Antiochus imposed strict enforcement of his plan, banning the practice of circumcision (a crucial component of Jewish identity). He also had the Jewish temple converted into a pagan sanctuary, and required Jews to sacrifice to the pagan gods. 

  * This led to a Jewish revolt and armed rebellion, which started in 167 BCE. The rebellion was led by a family of Jewish priests – **the Maccabeans** (aka **the Hasmoneans** ). The campaign was successful. They drove out the Syrian army and resumed full control of the land, reestablishing the Jewish state for the first time in 400 years. They rededicated the Temple to Yahweh, and appointed a high priest as ruler of the land. (Some pious Jews didn’t recognize the new priest’s legitimacy, as was not a descendant of the priest Zadok. This will prove an important point in a moment.) The Hasmoneans ruled the land for about 80 years – up until 63 BCE. 

  * They were conquered by Roman general **Pompey**. The Romans allowed the high priest to remain in office, and he acted as mediator between the Jews and the Romans. However, the Romans had ultimate authority. 

  * In 40 BCE, Rome appointed **Herod the Great** to rule Palestine. Herod was from a family from the neighboring land of Idumea. They were forced to convert to Judaism. Because of this, native Israelites considered Herod as half-Jewish at best. 

  * After Herod the Great’s death, his son, **Herod Antipas** , became the ruler of Galilee (the northern region of the land). He ruled this region during Jesus’ lifetime. (30s CE) 

  * The southern region was ruled by Roman prefects (administrators). **Pontius Pilate** was prefect during Jesus lifetime. (30s CE)

-This brief historical sketch of the 800 years of nearly unbroken foreign domination of the Jews -- in the land they believed was given to them by their god, Yahweh -- provides the contextual framework for understanding the historical background of the social, political, and religious tensions and crises in Palestine during the life and ministry of Jesus of Nazareth, and his own response to them.

**II. A Consequence of the Unorthodox Hasmonean Rule: The Formation of Jewish
Sects**

-Various sects emerged in reaction to the rule of Hasmoneans: 

**The Pharisees** : To preserve their faith and culture and to prevent
corruption from

Hellenization, these devout Jews were intent to follow the will of God through
obeying the Law of Moses. Unfortunately, the Law of Moses is ambiguous in many
places. Because of this, they developed the Mishnah, a set of rules that aimed
to clarify the Law of Moses, and thereby to help ensure that they obeyed it.
The Pharisees are important for understanding the historical Jesus in part
because it helps us understand his own teaching: He opposed theirs. He didn’t
think adherence to the Law was the most important aspect worshipping God. He
also disagreed with their way of following the Law by following the Mishnah.

**The Sadducees** : Among the four groups listed here, they had the most power
in Palestine in Jesus’ day. They were mainly members of the Jewish aristocracy
in Jerusalem, and were closely connected to the Jewish priesthood (who, in
turn was in charge of the Temple cult). Indeed, many Sadducees were themselves
priests. They were given some political power from the Romans, although they
had to defer to them. They were part of the local council (the Sanhedrin),
which was called upon to settle local matters. The Sadducees seemed to seek
peaceful relations with the Romans, and were thus very accommodating to the
Roman governor. As priests of the Temple who only accepted the Torah (the five
books of Moses), their religious mode of life emphasized proper involvement in
the worship of God as prescribed by the Torah. Although popular beliefs among
the Jews of Jesus’ day, the Sadducees denied the existence of angels and the
resurrection of the dead. The Sadducees are important for understanding the
historical Jesus in part because Jesus’ roused their anger by proclaiming that
their Temple – the focal point of their status and political power -- would be
destroyed in an imminent act of divine judgment.

**The Essenes** : The one Jewish sect from Jesus’ time not mentioned in the
New Testament. We know of them through the writings of Josephus, and from the
fact that they seemed to have been the ones who produced the Dead Sea Scrolls.
They lived as an isolated community in the wilderness area east of Jerusalem,
near the western shore of the Dead Sea (the area is now known as Qumran).
Their sect appears to have been formed around 150 BCE, during the Maccabean
period. Their sect seemed to have originated as a reaction to their belief
that their authority was usurped by the appointment of a non-Zadokite priest
during that period. They were apocalypticists, as they were convinced that the
end of time was imminent. They believed this would be accomplished by a final
battle between the children of light and the children of darkness, in which
God would triumph and his children would enter into his kingdom. Some believed
the apocalypse would involve two messiahs – a king and a priest. The kingly
messiah would rule the kingdom in righteousness, and the priestly messiah
would lead God’s people in worship in the purified Temple. In the meantime, as
preparation for the apocalypse, they isolated themselves in their community
and devoted themselves to ritual purity and the keeping of the Law of Moses.
Entrance into the community required giving up all of one’s worldly
possessions to the benefit of the community, and sharing in a common meal with
all the other members. The Essenes are important for understanding the
historical Jesus in part because he seemed to have shared many of their views:
belief in an imminent apocalypse, the need to prepare for the coming kingdom
of God, giving up all one’s possessions, and sharing a common meal with the
separated community.

**The Fourth Philosophy** : Several different sects adhered to a basic set of
beliefs of the Fourth Philosophy. The core beliefs among them were that: (i)
since God gave them their land, all foreign rule of it was illegitimate; (ii)
the appropriate response to foreign rule of their God-given land is
resistance, including violent resistance if necessary. Two of these groups
were (i) the “Sicarii” (Latin for “dagger”), and the “Zealots”. The Sicarii
assassinated and kidnapped many high- ranking Jewish officials because they
were thought to have been on the side of the Romans. The Zealots were Galilean
Jews who engaged in armed rebellion to take back their God-given land. In 67
CE, They overthrew the priestly aristocracy in a bloody coup, and encouraged
violent opposition to the Roman army, resulting in the destruction of
Jerusalem and the Temple in 70 CE. The Fourth Philosophy is important for
understanding the historical Jesus in part because he likewise thought Romans
should be kicked out of Israel. However, he didn’t think it was to be achieved
by violent revolt, but by God’s work in the events of the apocalypse.

  * They believed their god Yahweh gave them their land, in which they could live autonomously and worship him according to their laws and customs. 

  * They resented paying a tax that left many Jews at a subsistence level of living. 

  * In fact, many saw it as blasphemous to have to be forced to support an empire that dominated the very land that God had given them. 

-Many Jews therefore expressed their resentment, although not all in the same way: 

  * Some expressed it in silent protest through their **celebration of the Passover in Jerusalem**. Through celebration of this religious holiday, they were not merely celebrating their ancestor’s deliverance from Egypt many centuries in the past, but were also looking forward to their deliverance from their current Roman oppressors. The Romans were well aware of this symbolic form of protest, and thus stationed guards throughout Jerusalem during the Passover to prevent violent uprisings. 

  * Others expressed it in **nonviolent uprisings**. Occasionally, Roman political officials would do something that the Jews found offensive. Example. Pilate had Roman standards erected throughout Jerusalem that bore the image of Caesar. They voiced their disapproval by asking them to be removed. Pilate refused, and in response, many Jews a sit-in at his residence in Caesarea. 

  * Yet others expressed it in **prophetic proclamations of God’s imminent intervention** against the Romans on behalf of his people. Examples: Theudas, the Egyptian, etc. 

  * Finally, some expressed it in terms of **violent insurrections**. These were premeditated armed revolts. Example 1: Judas the son of Hezekiah (circa 6 CE). Example 2: The Zealot uprising in the 60s CE, which led to their defeat and the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple in 70 CE. 

-A very popular worldview among 1st century Palestinian Jews was **apocalypticism**. Those who held this view believed that God revealed to them the near future, according to which God would soon intervene in history and overthrow the forces of evil (esp. their foreign oppressors) and establish his kingdom on earth.

-Written apocalyptic sources include the Old Testament book of Daniel (probably written around the time of the Maccabean revolt), many writings of the Essene community (preserved in the Dead Sea Scrolls), and “apocalypses” that were written in the inter-testamental period.

-The apocalyptic worldview originated around the time of the Maccabbean Revolt. It was developed as a new explanation as to why God’s chosen people were not able to enjoy an autonomous existence, without foreign domination, in the Land their God had promised to them.

-Prior to apocalypticism, the explanation was that the Jews had sinned, or otherwise were unfaithful to their God Yahweh, and that foreign oppression was a punishment for this. This explanation can be found in many books of the Old Testament (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, and Hosea).

-However, many Jews became dissatisfied with this answer because it didn’t explain the Jewish experience very well. 

  * The righteous, obedient Jews suffered as well. 

  * The Jews remained oppressed by foreign domination even after collectively repenting and recommitting themselves to Yahweh. 

-As a result, a new explanation for these facts arose: apocalypticism. Apocalypticism includes the following defining features:

  * There are two cosmic forces at work in the universe: the forces of good and the forces of evil. 

  * The forces of good were headed by Yahweh, and the forces of evil were headed by God’s enemy, Satan. 

  * On God’s side were the good angels and life, and on Satan’s side where the demons and death. There is no middle ground: everyone is either with God or with Satan. You had to be aligned with one or the other. 

  * World history is split into two ages: the present age and the age to come. The present age is the age of sin and the devil. All in the present age are destined to suffer under the forces of evil. 

  * For some reason, God has allowed the forces of evil to reign during this age, but in the age to come, God will overcome the forces of darkness and the forces of good will rule forever. During this time, God will eliminate the forces of evil. This will include God overthrowing the foreign occupiers of the land of the Jews, and establishing the Kingdom of God on earth forever. 

  * All creation has become corrupt from human sin and from Satan’s activity. 

  * Until the new age arrives, things will not improve. 

  * In fact, things will only get worse. This will be so even if God’s people are obedient and faithful to him. 

  * At the end, in the age to come, God will intervene on behalf of his people and vindicate his name. 

  * This victory is certain, as God is the creator and ruler of the universe, and even Satan and his minions are his creation. 

  * The universal corruption of God’s creation will be overcome with God’s universal redemption of his creation. 

  * God will permanently destroy the forces of evil and establish an everlasting kingdom of righteousness. 

  * The destruction of the forces of evil will involve a final judgment from which no one can escape. He will even raise from the dead those who died without punishment during their earthly lives. 

  * Those who look for God’s victory should hold on and stay faithful to him, 

  * for the age to come is going to happen very soon. 

  * People should repent and prepare for this imminent event. 

_Key quote_ : “Some of the earliest traditions about Jesus portray him as a
Jewish apocalypticist who responded to the political and social crises of his
day, including the domination of his nation by a foreign power, by proclaiming
that his generation was living at the end of the age, that God would soon
intervene on behalf of his people, sending a cosmic judge from heaven, the Son
of Man who would destroy the forces of evil and set up God’s kingdom. In
preparation for his coming, the people of Israel needed to turn to God,
trusting him as a kindly parent and loving one another as his special
children. Those who refused to accept his message would be liable to the
judgment of God, soon to arrive with the coming Son of Man.” (p. 123)

###  Notes: Chapter 6 of Ehrman's _Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New
Millennium_

**Notes: Erhman’s** _Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millenium_ **, Ch.
6**

_Topic_ : The basic tools and source scholars uss to reconstruct the
Historical Jesus

-Recall that source criticism is the study of the sources behind the material in the Gospels:

-We've seen that the majority of scholars argue that the probable sources of these gospels are:

  * Mark: the earliest gospel written (sources for Matt. and Lk.)

  * Q: the material common to Matt. and Lk. that is not found in Mk

  * (Paul’s letters are even earlier source (50s CE) s, but they don’t seem to be used by the gospel authors to construct their gospels.)

-These are the earliest verifiable sources of evidence for Jesus we have.

-They are therefore not taken to be as trustworthy as the other sources.

-We’ve seen some reasons why scholars can’t take the Gospels and other sources of information about Jesus at face value.

-Because of this, they sift these sources by means of a number of criteria.

These criteria help scholars distinguish what Jesus probably did and didn’t
say and do.

1. **Early strata:** earlier sources are less likely to be distorted and more likely to preserve accurate information than later sources.

2\. **Absence of theological adornment** : Accounts with highly developed
theology are less likely to be historically accurate.

3\. **Absence of author bias** : Statements supporting author bias are less
credible than those that don’t.

-Once the early sources containing eyewitness testimony have been identified, scholars apply more exacting criteria.

-These are called _**criteria of authenticity**_ : criteria for determining what units of material within the sources probably indicate what Jesus said and did.

1. **Multiple independent attestation** : A unit of material attested by more than one independent source is more likely to be authentic than a unit attested by just one source.

  * Jesus began his ministry in association with John the Baptist (Mark, Q, John).

  * One of his brothers was named ‘James’ (Mark, Paul, Josephus).

  * Jesus told parables that likened the kingdom of God to a seed (Mark, Q, Gospel of Thomas).

2\. **Embarrassment** : If a unit of material does not support, or works
against, the agenda of the early church, then it is probably authentic.

3\. **Contextual credibility** : A unit of material that conforms to the
historical and social context of 1stcentury Palestine is more probably
authentic than one that does not.

  * Unlike the other two criteria, this one often has a _negative_ function of ruling out _inauthentic_ material.

  * Gospel of John’s report that people feared confessing Jesus as Messiah would be put out of the synagogue

-Historical Jesus scholars reconstruct the most probable account of who Jesus was by: 

  * finding the earliest and most credible sources, 

  * using objective criteria to determine which units of material within these sources are probably authentic

• The earliest sources are, in chronological order: Paul’s letters, Q, Mark,
M, and L.

• Later, less reliable sources that may have some eyewitness information are
the canonical gospel of John, and the non-canonical gospels of Peter and of
Thomas.

• The material from our earliest sources that can be verified by passing these
criteria are then used to reconstruct an account of who Jesus probably was,
and what he probably said and did.

  * Visited by wise men who followed a star

  * Adoration of Jesus in the temple after his birth

###  Notes: Chapter 5 of Ehrman's _Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New
Millennium_

**Notes: Ehrman’s J _esus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium_ ,
Chapter 5**

_Key Ehrman quote_ : “Despite a good deal of media hype in recent years, a lot
of people still don’t realize that we have other Gospels that did not make it
into the New Testament. Lots of other Gospels, in fact – over couple of dozen
of them. Many of these Gospels make for fascinating reading and can be of real
significance for a scholar interested in knowing about how Jesus came to be
understood in later times. But most of them are latecomers – the bulk of them
date from the third to the eighth centuries, hundreds of years after Jesus
himself. And nearly all of them are based on the New Testament Gospels
themselves. For these reasons, they are not, as a rule, useful for the
historian seeking independent verification of the things Jesus said and did.”
(p. 65)

  * The Infancy Gospel of Thomas: largely historically worthless.

  * The Gospel of Peter: contains perhaps a few scraps of reliable information about Jesus trial and death, but largely legendary in character (On this latter point, see, especially its account of Jesus’ resurrection).

  * The Coptic Gospel of Thomas: contains some independent sayings of Jesus not found in the synoptic gospels (Matt., Mk. And Lk.) or John, but was probably written in the second century, and is pervaded with later, gnostic theology.

_Sub-conclusion_ : “In sum, there does not appear to be much information about
the historical Jesus outside the canon of the New Testament. . .Even though
there are lots of other Gospels out there, they are almost certainly entirely
late and legendary. To be sure, the Gospel of Peter may theoretically provide
some corroborating information about Jesus’ last hours, and the Coptic Gospel
of Thomas may preserve some independently attested sayings of Jesus. But even
on a generous estimate, these books will not provide any significant help in
our quest. No matter how you slice it, you have to rely on the New Testament
if you want to know about the life of the historical Jesus.” (p. 78)

-These are the earliest written Christian sources we have – earlier even than the four Gospels, and perhaps even Q -- and they do contain information about Jesus. 

-Unfortunately (a) they do not contain much – the information could fit on a 3” x 5” notecard – and (b) the little they say only corroborates what the four Gospels already say:

  * Jesus was born of a woman (Gal. 4:4). Shocker! 

  * He was born a Jew (Gal. 4:4). 

  * He was reputedly from the lineage of King David (Rom. 1:3). 

  * One of his brothers was named ‘James’ (Gal. 1:19). 

  * He had twelve disciples (1 Cor. 15:5). 

  * He conducted ministry among the Jews (Rom. 15:8). 

  * He had a last meal with his disciples on the night he was betrayed (1 Cor. 11:23). 

  * Paul knows what Jesus said at his last meal (1 Cor. 11:23-25). 

  * Jesus died by crucifixion (1 Cor. 2:2). 

  * Jesus said Christians shouldn’t divorce (1 Cor. 7:11; cf. Mk. 10:11-12). 

  * Jesus said Christians should pay their preacher (1 Cor. 9:14; cf. Lk. 10:7). 

  * Christians should pay their taxes (Rom. 13:7; cf. Mk. 12:17). 

  * Christians should fulfill the Law of Moses by loving their neighbors as themselves (Gal. 5:14; cf. Matt. 22:39-40). 

_Key Ehrman quote_ : “Paul does say a lot about the importance of Jesus,
especially the importance of his death, resurrection, and imminent return from
heaven. But in terms of historical information, what I’ve just listed is about
all there is. Imagine what we wouldn’t know about Jesus if these letters were
our only sources of information. We hear nothing here of the details of Jesus’
birth or parents or early life, nothing of his baptism or temptation in the
wilderness; nothing of his teaching about the coming kingdom of God. We have
no indication that he ever told parables, that he ever healed anyone, cast out
a demon, or raised the dead. We learn nothing of his transfiguration or
triumphal entry, nothing of his cleansing of the Temple, nothing of his
interrogation by the Sanhedrin or trial before Pilate, nothing of his being
rejected in favor of Barabbas, of his being mocked, of his being flogged, and
so on. The historian who wants to know about the traditions concerning Jesus –
or indeed, about the historical Jesus himself – will not be much helped by the
surviving letters of Paul. Or indeed, by the other authors of the New
Testament.” (p. 79)

_Mark’s gospel_ : This is the first gospel written (60s CE). Matthew and Luke
use it as a major primary source for their gospels (Matthew has over 500
verses parallel to Mark’s 661 verses; Luke has about 330 verses of Mark).

_The Q Source_ : This is the large body of material common to Matthew and Luke
that is not found in Mark. Here we have lots of information about Jesus’,
especially what he said. It’s also very early (50s- 60s CE).

_The M Source_ : This is the material unique to Matthew. It’s also early –
earlier than Matthew, at least.

_The L Source_ : This is the material unique to Luke. It, too, is early –
earlier than Luke, at least.

###  Notes: Chapter 4 of Ehrman's _Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New
Millennium_

_Key Ehrman quote_ : “[According to the] commonsensical view, Jesus’ impact on
the society of his day must have been immense, like a comet striking the
earth. In that case, we could expect to find scores of accounts of his words
and deeds written by contemporaries outside the group of his closest
disciples. Surely people had a lot to say about this, whether his friends or
enemies . . . Unfortunately, the commonsensical view is not even close to
being right – biblical epics on the wide screen (the source of many people’s
knowledge about the Bible!) notwithstanding. If we look at the historical
record itself . . . it appears that whatever his influence on subsequent
generations, Jesus’ impact on society was practically nil, less like a comet
striking the planet than a stone tossed into the ocean.” (p. 56)

_Pliny the Younger_ (112 CE), Epistle 10.96: “They were accustomed to meet on
a fixed day before dawn and sing responsively a hymn to Christ as to a god,
and bound themselves to a solemn oath, not to any wicked deeds, but never to
commit any fraud, theft, adultery, never to falsify their word, not to deny a
trust when they should be called upon to deliver it up. When this was over, it
was their custom to depart and to assemble again to partake of a meal—but
ordinary and innocent food.”

  * In this letter of correspondence to Emperor Trajan, we learn of the practices of some early Christians. 

  * Unfortunately, we learn nothing about Jesus’ words or deeds before his crucifixion.

_Suetonius_ (113-114 CE): from The Twelve Caesars, Life of Claudius 25: "Since
the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he
expelled them from Rome."

  * It’s not clear that this is a reference to Jesus (‘Chrestus’ was a Greek name), but it may well be. 

  * Unfortunately, the reference in the passage to “the instigation of Chrestus” must be a reference to Christians, and not Jesus, as the passage is referring to public disturbances twenty years after Jesus’ crucifixion.

_Tacitus_ (115 CE), Annals 15.44: "Consequently, to get rid of the report,
Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class
hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus,
from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the
reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and
a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out
not only in Judea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all
things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their center and
become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded
guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not
so much of the crime of firing he city, as of hatred against mankind".

  * Here we do have a non-Christian Roman historian reporting information about Jesus. 

  * He reports that Jesus was crucified by Pontius Pilate, that a sect believed he was the Christ, and that they were commonly called ‘Christians’. 

  * Unfortunately, we already have reports of this from earlier Christian sources, and so Tacitus provides no new information about Jesus. I

  * It’s perhaps worth noting that Tacitus got it wrong that Pilate was a procurator (he was a prefect).

_Josephus_ (93-94 CE), Antiquities 18.3.3: "Now there was about this time
Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of
wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He
drew over to him both many of the Jews, and many of the Gentiles. He was the
Christ; and when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us,
had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not
forsake him, for he appeared to them alive again the third day, as the divine
prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning
him; and the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct to this
day."

  * The authenticity of this passage is extremely controversial -- for example, we know from his sources that Josephus never converted to Christianity.

  * Furthermore, the fact that it was Christians who preserved and translated Josephus’ Antiquities through the centuries raise worries of tampering. 

  * For this reason and others, most scholars (N.B., including William Lane Craig and most conservative NT scholars -EA) think the “Christianized” statements are later Christian interpolations. 

  * However, most scholars think the text probably contained an authentic version of the passage from Josephus. The passage without the added interpolations reads as follows: "Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man. He was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews, and many of the Gentiles. And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men among us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; and the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct to this day." (N.B., this is the version William Lane Craig and most conservative NT scholars accept as well -EA)

_The Talmud_ (circa 200s CE): "On the eve of Passover Yeshu was hanged. For
forty days before the execution took place, a herald went forth and cried, "He
is going forth to be stoned because he has practiced sorcery and enticed
Israel to apostasy. Any one who can say anything in his favour, let him come
forward and plead on his behalf." But since nothing was brought forward in his
favour he was hanged on the eve of the Passover! - Ulla retorted: Do you
suppose that he was one for whom a defence could be made? Was he not a
_Mesith_ [enticer], concerning him Scripture says, _Neither shalt though
spare, neither shalt thou conceal him?_ With Yeshu however it was different,
for he was connected with the government for royalty [i.e., influential]. Our
Rabbis taught: Yeshu had five disciples, Matthai, Nakai, Nezer, Buni, and
Todah.” (Sanhedrin 43a)

  * This passage seems to be referring to Jesus’ crucifixion, as well as to his disciples (but notice that it says he was hanged, not crucified, and that he only had five – not twelve – disciples).

  * Unfortunately, the source is was written over 150 years after the events described, and because of this, most scholars doubt its historical worth as a source about Jesus.

**Conclusion** : We have no non-Christian sources that give us new information
about the life of Jesus from the first 100 years after his death.

Millennium_

**Notes: Ehrman’s _Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium_ , Chapter
3**

Evaluating the primary sources: who wrote the Gospels, and when did they write
them?

-The Gospels we have in their current form say that they were written by two of Jesus’ original disciples (Matthew the tax collector, and John, the “beloved disciple”), and by two friends of the apostles (Peter’s secretary, Mark, and Paul’s traveling companion, Luke).

-The problem is that we have strong reasons to doubt these claims. 

  * The Gospels were originally published anonymously: they didn’t originally have the titles of “The Gospel According to Matthew”, “The Gospel According to Mark”, etc. 

  * None of the Gospels claim they were written by an eyewitness. 

  * They all describe the events they discuss in the third person (perhaps John is an exception. We’ll discuss this later.). 

  * The Gospels were all written in Greek, but the original disciples were Jews who spoke Aramaic or Hebrew. 

  * About 90% of the population was completely illiterate, including those in the socioeconomic classes to which the disciples belonged. In fact, the Book of Acts (4:13) states that Peter and John were illiterate. Only the rich elite could afford the leisure and training to learn Greek. 

-The earliest reports we have that discuss the authorship of the Gospels are from a Christian named Papius from 120-130 CE. This is late testimony as it stands, but there are further reasons to doubt that it supports traditional authorship. He makes two main claims about their authorship:

  * _Claim 1_ : During his missionary journeys, Peter would talk about the sayings and deeds of Jesus, and Mark would write them down, although not in order. Some take this to be a reference to the Gospel of Mark. However, note that Papius thinks Mark was not written by an eyewitness but that it is a second-hand account, and that Mark modified what he received to order to the material.

  * _Claim 2_ : Matthew wrote down the sayings (but not the deeds) of Jesus in Hebrew, and “everyone interpreted them as they could”. Some take him to be referring to the Gospel of Matthew. However, the earliest copies we have of Matthew are all in Greek, not Hebrew. Furthermore, Matthew contains much more than just the words of Jesus.It thus seems that he’s not referring to Matthew.

-The next earliest report we have that discuss the authorship of the Gospels is from the Christian bishop Irenaeus near the end of the 2nd century CE. He claims that only four gospels are accurate and divinely inspired (Matthew, Mark. Luke, and John). This testimony is late as it stands CE (about 150 years or so after the events), but there are further reasons to be suspicious:

  * Irenaeus was involved in intense debates about orthodoxy, during a time when very many Christian sects, with very different views of who Jesus was.

  * All these other competing Christian sects appealed to their written gospels and other texts as proof of their sect as “orthodox”.

  * Irenaeus wanted to unify the church by ruling out all other versions of Christianity as heretical.

  * It would greatly help his cause if he could make it the official church position that just the traditional four gospels were authoritative.

-Luke (1:1-4) reveals that many attempted to write down an account of the life and deeds of Jesus, and that he was doing the same, from a third-person, non- eyewitness standpoint. He also implies that the other accounts are inaccurate. Since we know he relies on Mark’s gospel as a source, this seems to imply that he thinks Mark’s gospel wasn’t completely accurate.

-For these reasons and others, most scholars think the gospels were written anonymously, and not by eyewitnesses, in the Roman Empire outside of Palestine.

-So, there is a 35-65 year gap between the historical events of Jesus’ ministry and their being written down in the Gospels

-This gives scholars pause about taking the gospels at face value as 100% reliable testimony.

  * Imagine trying to write the first written account of the life of JFK today, without the aid of photographs, videos, newspapers, the Internet, or any other media sources, but only reports from second- or third- or fourth or fifth-hand accounts of his life and career.

-A final consideration in evaluating the Gospels as sources of material about Jesus:

  * The original material behind the Gospels was based on oral traditions about Jesus, which were primarily developed and dispersed by evangelists and ordinary Christians, as the Christian message spread from Palestine to the outer Roman Empire

  * The game “telephone” illustrates how orally transmitted material can quickly and unintentionally change by transmission from one person to another.o The material was told with the aim of converting non-Christians, and to develop their understanding of the faith.o The Roman Empire was immense, and so there was no reliable way for the apostles to prevent alteration of the material.

-For these reasons and others, most scholars think we can’t take the gospels at face value as 100% reliable historical sources about Jesus

###  Notes: Chapter 2 of Ehrman's _Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New
Millennium_

Why we can’t take the Gospels at face value: two example discrepancies.

-All four Gospels say that Jesus died some time during the Jewish Feast of Passover

  * Mark reports (14:12) that he ate his last meal with his disciples on the day of Preparation for the Passover, and that (15:25) he was taken and crucified at 9a.m. on the morning after the Passover meal. 

  * John reports (13:1) that he ate his last meal with his disciples before the festival of the Passover, and that (19:14) he was crucified at about noon, on the day over the Passover. 

-The accounts cannot be reconciled (meal and crucifixion are both reported to have occurred on different days and times).

-Why did John change the narrative? To make the crucifixion fit his overall theme of Jesus as the Lamb of God that is sacrificed on the Passover.

-Mark, the earliest gospel, doesn’t include the stories of Jesus’ birth.

-The accounts of Jesus’ birth and surrounding events occur only in Matthew and Luke.

-However, the two accounts differ on a number of points, including Jesus’ original hometown:

  * Matthew (1:18-2:23) depicts Jesus’ original hometown as Bethlehem. Jesus is born there. The three wise men then tell Herod that a future king of Israel is born in Bethlehem, after which they spend two years following a star to greet him and give him gifts at their home(nota manger). Herod sends troops to kill all children in Bethlehem aged two and under (to protect his kingship from Jesus). Mary and Joseph are warned of this, and so they all flee to Egypt until Herod’s death. However, they decide not to go back home to Bethlehem in Judea, as they fear the new ruler there: Herod’s son, Archelaus. Instead, they decide to move to Nazareth in Galilee and make a home there. 

  * By contrast, Luke (chapters 1-2) depict Jesus’ original hometown as Nazareth. They go from Nazareth to Bethlehem to follow a decree from Caesar Augustus for a worldwide census, according to which everyone is to travel to the hometown of their ancestors. Luke claims that Joseph is of the lineage of King David, who is from Bethlehem, and so that is where they go. When they get there, Mary gives birth to Jesus in a manger (no room at the inn). After all of the Jewish rituals related to birth are performed, they return home to Nazareth. 

  * Wise men come to worship Jesus in one, shepherds in the other 

  * The cause of migration is the wrath of Herod in one, but Caesar’s worldwide census in the other. 

-Some of the elements of the narrative aren’t contradictory, but nonetheless historically and scientifically implausible:

  * Following a moving star? And how close to the ground must the star have been to pick out Jesus’ home? 

  * A worldwide (or at least empire-wide) census? Despite the existence of a multitude of secular historical records from the time – including a biography from Caesar Augustus himself -- there is no independent attestation to such a major event in any of them. In any case, why would Caesar have all citizens register at the hometown of their ancient ancestors from 1,000 years ago? How would one even go about this? 

  * We know from Josephus that Quirinius’ governorship in Syria was 10 years afterHerod’s death, but Luke depicts their reigns as contemporaneous. 

-Given that the accounts contain these historical inaccuracies, why did they add them?

-The most natural explanation is that they added them to make theological points:

  * The authors of these two Gospels read the Old Testament book of Micah, which says that a future Messiah would come out of Bethlehem (5:2). 

  * However, they both knew that Jesus was from Nazareth, not Bethlehem. 

  * So they had to add stories to support their theological point that Jesus is the Messiah. 

-Conclusion: we can’t take the Gospel accounts in the New Testament at face value. Rather, we have to use historical methods to distinguish the accurate from the inaccurate portions of these documents. Once this is done, we can use the accurate portions to reconstruct a historically accurate portrait of Jesus.

[Other examples of editing by the Gospel authors not discussed in Ehrman's
book:

i) _Jesus' anger_ : Mark has Jesus groan in Mark 8:12. A number of
translations say he sighed deeply in his spirit, but the word is the same as
that for a groan. Mark also has Jesus express anger (e.g., Mark 3:5); Luke
omits the bit about anger in the parallel (Luke 6:10), while Matthew omits the
passage altogether. In Mark 10:14, Mark has Jesus express indignation at his
disciples; Matt. and Lk. omit this attribution in their parallels (Matt.
19:14; Luke 18:16). Etc.

ii) _The view among Jesus' relatives about Jesus' sanity_ : Relatives say he
is out of his mind in Mark 3:21. Both Matthew and Luke omit it.

iii) _Jesus' view of non-Jews_ : The commissioning of the disciples on their
first missionary journey occurs in Matthew, but not in Luke. This follows a
theme in Luke of portraying Jesus of the savior of both the Jews and the
Gentiles, and of having Jesus favorably disposed to the Gentiles. Thus, Luke
leaves out Jesus' references to non-Jews as pigs and dogs that are found in
Mark and Matthew (Mark 7:27; Matt. 15:26; and arguably Matt. 7:6). --EA]

###  Notes: Overview of Ehrman's _Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New
Millennium_

**The Big Picture** : Chapter 1 does the stage-setting and states the book’s
main thesis: Jesus was an apocalyptic prophet. Chapters 2-3 explain why we
can’t take the gospels at face value. Chapters 4-5 sift the sources for the
historical Jesus to determine which sources are the most credible. Chapter 6
states and explains the core historical methodology scholars use to
reconstruct the historical Jesus from these sources. Chapters 7-12 apply the
lessons and historical methodology laid out in chapters 2-6: we can apply the
historical tools of source criticism and the criteria of authenticity to
reconstruct the historical Jesus.Chapter 13 sketches an account of how the
church’s conception of Jesus evolved from that of an apocalyptic preacher to
the Son of God.

**Part I: (Ch. 1) The main thesis introduced: Jesus was an apocalypticist.**

Ch. 1: Christians from the present all the way through the past have believed
that the end of the world would occur in their generation. There is a good
reason for this: Jesus thought so, too.

**Part II (Ch. 2-3): We can’t take the canonical Gospels’ portraits of Jesus
at face value**

Ch. 2: There are clear cases where the gospel authors modify their sources to
score a theological point.

Ch. 3: The gospels were written anonymously, 35-65 years after the events they
describe, by Greek authors who are using second-, third, fourth-hand
information that was based on oral traditions about Jesus.

**Part III (Chs. 4-5): Despite this, the canonical gospels are the best
sources we’ve got**

Ch. 4: The non-Christian sources from the 1st century (whether pagan or
Jewish) contain virtually nothing about Jesus.

Ch. 5: The Christian sources outside the canonical gospels are of two main
sorts: (a) the other New Testament documents, and (b) extra-canonical
writings. The information in (a) about Jesus’ earthly ministry can fit on a
3x5 notecard, and while there are lots and lots of (b)-type sources, they are
much later, are obviously derivative, and unreliable.

**Part IV (Ch. 6): Happily, we have historical methods that can help us
reliably reconstruct the historical Jesus from our sources**

Ch. 6: We can reconstruct the historical Jesus by (i) isolating our earliest,
most reliable sources about him, and (ii) applying criteria of authenticity to
them, to see which units of material within those sources probably go back to
Jesus’ life and ministry.

**Part V (Chs. 7-12): Reconstructing the historical Jesus: Jesus was an
apocalyptic prophet**

Ch. 7: Stage-setting chapter: a sketch of Jesus’ environment in 1st-century
Palestine

Ch. 8: The basic case for Jesus as an apocalyptic prophet

Ch. 9: A closer look 1: the apocalyptic prophet hypothesis makes best sense of
his core teachings

Ch. 10: A closer look 2: the apocalyptic prophet hypothesis makes best sense
of his ethical teachings

Ch. 11: A closer look 3: the apocalyptic prophet hypothesis makes best sense
of his actions

Ch. 12: A closer look 4: the apocalyptic prophet hypothesis makes best sense
of his last days

**Part VI (Ch. 13): How his followers’ conception of Jesus evolved**

Ch. 13: His followers’ conception evolved from apocalyptic prophet to Son of
God as it spread from 1stcentury Palestine to the outer Roman Empire.

"In my paper, I suggested that the lack of a "material" cause is at last as
counter-intuitive as the lack of an "efficient" cause. Craig's response is
interesting. There are, he says, just three possibilities with respect to the
origin of the universe: "the infinitude of the past, creation _ex nihilo_ ,
[and] spontaneous origination _ex nihilo_." Assuming (as we have agreed to do
for the sake of argument) that Craig's philosophical arguments against the
infinite past are sound, we must choose between creation _ex nihilo_ and
uncaused origination _ex nihilo_. Craig says he prefers the creation
hypothesis, since it involves only one counter-intuitive element, whereas the
spontaneous origination hypothesis "is doubly counter-intuitive in that it
denies of the universe both a material and (especially) an efficient cause.".
. .[T]here is a serious gap in Craig's argument for creation _ex nihilo_ ,
since the trilemma -- either the infinite past, or creation _ex nihilo,_ or
spontaneous origination _ex nihilo_ \-- fails to exhaust the logical
alternatives. There is at least one other possibility that Craig fails to
consider -- viz., that God made the world out of something-or-other that is
(or "was") _eternal_.

I confess that I do not have a candidate for a material cause of the universe.
. .we don't seem to be acquainted with any. . .eternal "stuffs" out of which
God might have made the universe. But that shouldn't stop Craig. We don't
encounter eternal persons either, but he thinks his commitment to P1 [i.e.,
the premise that everything that begins to exist has a cause of its existence.
-EA] forces him to postulate one. Why, then, does he not simply conclude that
there must have been an eternal material cause, on the ground that he can
thereby avoid, not only the "double absurdity" of spontaneous generation, but
also the "single absurdity" of creation _ex nihilo?"_

"...[O]ne can have a system of beliefs that is similar to those which
Plantinga describes, involving massive misconceptions which are presupposed in
many beliefs. The variety of unreliable sets of cognitive faculties is
endless. And clearly, a very great many of these will lead to maladaptive
action, including very many of those which are of the type Plantinga
described. Moreover, it should be intuitively clear that if one were to select
one of the unreliable cognitive systems at random, it would take an enormous
stroke of luck to get one that was actually adaptive, that is, to get an
unreliable cognitive system in which the falsehoods cancelled each other out
in just the right way, so to speak, as to allow for adaptive action. Another
way of thinking about the issue: imagine that cognitive systems producing
mostly false beliefs are represented by points in a plane, and someone throws
a dart at random at the plane; then it is hard to avoid the strong intuition
that we would almost certainly _not_ hit a point representing a cognitive
system that in addition to producing mostly false beliefs was also roughly as
adaptive as reliable systems might be....The idea behind this assessment is
that a great deal more can go wrong with unreliable cognitive faculties than
with reliable cognitive faculties."

###  Notes on Morriston's "Must There Be a Standard of Moral Goodness Apart
from God?"

  
1\. Setup: Divine command theory and the Euthyphro Dilemma

1.3 Choice point: Either bite the bullet and say his commands are arbitrary,
or say they’re somehow independent of God’s will (while still preserving
sovereignty)

1.4 The focus of the paper: The second choice — modified divine command theory

2.1 Both versions attempt to go between the horns of the Euthyphro Dilemma by
modifying DCT so that something is morally right or wrong just in case a
_good_ God commands it, and by saying that the objective standard of goodness
is _internal_ to God.

2.2 However, they differ in their account of how God serves as ground of
goodness

2.3.1 God’s essential properties, which he has in all worlds in which he
exists.

2.4 Version II: Alston (and, to a close enough approximation, Adams -EA):

2.4.2 Goodness supervenes directly on God’s being — on God himself

  
3\. Problem for the Platonic version: falls prey to a Euthyphro-like dilemma,
applied to God’s properties

3.1 Either God is good because God has the properties that constitute moral
goodness, or the properties are good because God has them.

3.2. If God is good because God has the properties that constitute moral
goodness, then the moral properties are the standard of goodness -- not God.

3.3. If the properties are good because God has them, then goodness is
arbitrary.

3.4. Therefore, either moral properties are the standard of goodness (and not
God), or goodness is arbitrary

4\. Alston’s (/Adams') Attempted Solution to the Euthyphro-like Dilemma: God,
Kripke, and the Standard Meter Stick

4.1 Identify God himself, and not his properties, as the ultimate standard of
Goodness

4.2 On this sort of view, when it comes to goodness, God functions in a way
analogous to Kripke's standard meter stick (the SMS for short) functions in
grounding the truth-conditions of 'meter'

4.3 While the length of SMS is not analyzed in terms of any other standard
beyond itself, the SMS serves as the standard by which all other lengths have
the property of being a meter in length: an object is a meter in length just
in case its length exactly resembles the length of _that_ stick (viz., the
SMS).

4.4 Similarly, while God ( _qua_ the Good) is not analyzed in terms of any
other standard beyond himself, he serves as the standard by which all other
entities have the property of goodness: an object is good just to the extent
that it resembles _that_ being (viz., God _qua_ the Good).

5.1 The meter stick illustration fails, part I: like Kripke’s case, it’s
arbitrary what we use to fix the referent of ‘Good’.

5.1.1 The standard meter stick is _replacable_ — any old stick of that length
can play the same role, so why can’t any old being — or even just the
combination of properties — play the role of the Good? Appeal to God as
standard is arbitrary in at least this sense (see Jeremy Koons' paper for
other senses)

5.1.2 Reply: No, only God has the unique morally perfect nature to play the
role (only God is perfectly loving, just, etc.)

5.1.3 Rejoinder: If this is the answer, then we have reverted back to the
Platonic account of Goodness, as the justification is that God uniquely has
the Good-making properties. So it’s the properties that do the work after all.

5.1.4 Reply: Not being satisfied with Alston's (/Adams' -EA) "God = the Good"
account reveals an arbitrary preference for the Platonic account. For neither
account can give a further answer as to why the analysans should/must be
counted as the Good (property combo vs. God). But explanations must come to an
end somewhere.

5.1.5 Rejoinder: Maybe so, but that’s a problem that works to the advantage of
the Platonist. For their theory is simpler without loss of scope and fit.

5.1.5.1 The Platonist says it’s enough to say that goodness supervenes on the
combination of properties that make up God’s nature.

5.1.5.2 Alston says, no, that’s not enough; goodness supervenes on this
combination of properties only because of the further fact that they are the
characteristics of God.

5.1.6 Reply: the complication isn’t superfluous; these character-constituting
properties can’t have moral force without there being instantiated in a person
who has that character.

5.1.7 Rejoinder ( _tu quoque_ ) Not true: both accounts fail to entail that
anyone who understands the moral ideal thereby has at least some inclination
to pursue it. Compare:

5.1.7.1 “I understand the property of being compassionate, but I have not the
slightest desire to be compassionate.”

5.1.7.2 “The creator of the universe is compassionate, but I have not the
slightest desire to be compassionate.”

5.1.7.3 on both the Platonic and Alstonian (/Adamsian -EA) accounts, there
will be some who aren’t motivated to be moral.

5.1.8 Reply: the complication is worth it, as it preserves God’s sovereignty,
while the Platonist account does not.

5.2 The Meter Stick illustration fails, part II: God and the standard meter
play similar roles in the truth conditions for the application of the
predicates in question.

5.2.1 On the standard Kripkean account, the standard meter is used only to fix
_the reference_ of ‘meter’. As such:

5.2.1.1 Other sticks with the same length would work equally well.

5.2.1.2 Other sticks would still have the property of being a meter long even
if the standard meter stick shrunk, expanded, or was annihilated.

5.2.2 Therefore, the SMS does not figure in the analysis of what _it is to be_
a meter long.

5.2.3 True, it can serve as a criterion for determining when the truth-
conditions for applying the predicate ‘meter’ are satisfied, but that’s not
the same thing.

5.2.4 Therefore, if God played the same role with ‘Good” as the standard meter
stick plays with ‘meter’ then, analogously, God would not figure into the
analysis of what the Good is. Indeed, if the analogy is meant to be tight, it
would be the relevant properties God has, and by which we mean to fix the
reference of ‘Good” that does the heavy lifting here.

5.2.4.1 Goodness supervenes directly on the properties, and not directly on
God's being.

5.2.4.2 Even if God’s nature changed, or he stopped existing, the validity of
those properties of the standard would remain unchanged.

5.2.5 Therefore, if they play similar roles, then the analogy supports the
Platonic account, and not the Alston/Adams view.

5.2.6 Reply: The problem here goes no deeper than Alston’s chosen analogy of
the standard meter stick and the predicate, ‘meter’. If we pick another
predicate — say, _Reaganeque_ or _Clintonesque_ — then the illustration goes
through: the relevant persons must figure into the truth- conditions for
predicate ascription in these cases. Similarly for God with ‘The Good’.

5.2.7 Rejoinder 1: This isn’t clearly so. Example. A fictional character like
Don Quixote can figure into the truth-conditions for ‘quixotic’, in which case
no real person must exist to do that work. But if not, then it’s not clear why
the existence of Reagan or Clinton must figure into the truth- conditions of
‘Reaganesque’ and ‘Clintonesque’.

5.2.8 Rejoinder 2: The heart of the issue: concerns whether God plays an
essential role in the truth-conditions for the applicability of ‘Good’. And
the answer seems to be ‘no’.

5.2.8.1 Our intuitions here largely depend on our intuitions about the
following counterpossibles:

1\. If God did not exist, then no one could be morally good or bad.

2\. If God were not loving or just, then no one could be morally good or bad.

5.2.8.3 But if so, then God plays no essential role in the truth- conditions
for the applicability of ‘Good’

5.2.10 Reply: Yes, but only because they entail that they are _vacuously_
true, which they are not. To see this, compare:

3\. If God did not exist, then a person could still be morally good or bad.

4\. If God were not loving or just, then a person could still be morally good
or bad.

The person who accepts Alston’s analysis of ‘Good’ is committed to saying that
(3) and (4) are both false. So they’re likewise committed to denying that all
counterpossibles are vacuously true, in which case, they’re committed to
rejecting Lewis-Stalnaker semantics, in which case they can’t consistently
raise the present objection.

  
6\. Implications of Platonism I: Ways in Which Platonism Doesn’t Restrict
God’s Sovereignty

6.1.1 God is omniscient, and so he has perfect knowledge of morality.

6.1.2 For the same reason, he has perfect knowledge of what’s in our hearts

6.2.2 Our natures determine what is harmful and beneficial for us

6.2.3 As such, they partly determine what is morally right and wrong for us

6.2.4 In this way, God is the source of moral truths about what is good and
bad for us.

6.3.1 It could turn out that it’s a necessary truth (though not in virtue of
God’s commands) that creatures ought to obey the commands of a loving creator.

6.3.2 The content of these commands need not even reflect necessary truths
(e.g., we ought to obey the Sabbath)

  
7\. Implications of Platonism II: Ways in Which Platonism Restricts God’s
Sovereignty

7.1.4 God is subject to them: he must live up to them to be good.

7.2.1 The same goes for the laws of mathematics and logic

7.2.3.1 God could make it that 1 and 1 equal 3

7.2.3.2 God could make it that it’s morally good to be cruel

7.3 No plausible theory accepts that there are no limits on God’s sovereignty

7.3.1 Even theistic activists like Morris deny that God could make the laws of
logic and math different

7.3.2 On both the Platonic account and Alston’s(/Adams' -EA) account, the
standard of moral goodness is not up to god. For according to them:

**7.3.2.4 Therefore, it is not up to God what the moral standard of goodness
is.  
7.3.2.5 Therefore, even modified divine command theory, like Platonism, makes
moral goodness beyond the control of God.  
(7.3.2.6 Therefore, it’s not at all clear that modified divine command theory
is motivated over straight Platonism)**

Intuition check: Assume Platonism about properties, propositions, and possible
worlds. Such is the natural backdrop of the modal ontological argument. Assume
further that the key possibility premise of the modal ontological argument is
true, viz., that there is a possible world at which maximal excellence is
exemplified. Then by Axiom S5 and that premise, we get the God of classical
theism -- or do we? Seems to me we don't. For the picture is that God is
ontologically posterior to and dependent upon the existence and ontological
structure of the platonic multiverse -- God's existence is the ontological
consequence of the nature and structure of platonic space. But if that's
right, then God is, in a real sense, a dependent being, in which case
classical theism is false.

Thanks for the pointer, Robin! I'll give it a look.

###  Partial Notes: Morriston's "A Critical Evaluation of the Kalam Argument"

> 1\. An eternal sufficient cause must have an eternal effect.

> But since it’s natural to assume Craig thinks God needs no help in creating
> a universe, he seems to also accept:

> 2\. God’s will to create a universe with a beginning is sufficient to
> produce it.

> 3\. God’s will to create a universe with a beginning is eternal.

> Which is self-contradictory. (N.B. again, assuming real temporal becoming

> keep the need for a cause for the beginning of the universe.).

4.2 Craig's first reply: God's will as a necessary but not sufficient cause  
4.2.1 In print, Craig seems to reject (2).  
4.2.2 However, this is problematic:  
4.2.2.1 it seems incompatible with God’s omnipotence: How can God’s eternally
willing a universe fail to accomplish its effect? It seems that that would
accomplish its effect if anything would.  
4.3 Craig's second reply: intending vs. undertaking  
4.3.1 Craig attempts to mitigate the problem by making a distinction between
intending and undertaking:  
4.3.1.1 God timelessly, eternally intends a universe with a beginning  
4.3.1.2 but it doesn’t occur until he undertakes the task by exercising his
causal power to bring about his intention.  
4.3.2 Problem: This only pushes the problem back a step:  
4.3.2.1 What’s the relationship between God’s willing/intending and his
undertaking?  
4.3.2.2 If his willing/intending to create is sufficient for his
undertaking/exercising causal power to create, then his undertaking/exercising
causal power to create should be eternal, in which case the universe should be
eternal.  

4.3.2.3 The only way out is to deny that God’s will/intention is sufficient
for both creating the universe and (even) for undertaking to create the
universe.  
4.3.2.4 But this is implausible. For to keep the analogy between human and
divine willing/personal causation going, we have to keep the analogy between
the cases where willing and undertaking come apart.  
4.3.2.5 But the problem is that the analogy breaks down. For there are three
main causes for the coming apart of intending and undertaking in human
willing, and none apply to God:  
4.3.2.5.1 (i) When the chosen time to act has not yet arrived: God is in a
timeless state “when” he both intends and undertakes to create, and thus can’t
delay in creating.  
4.3.2.5.2 (ii) When we change our mind/plans: God is omniscient, and thus
can’t change his mind/plans;  
4.3.2.5.3 (iii) When we succumb to weakness of will: God is omnipotent, and
thus can’t succumb to weakness of will.

###  Notes on Morriston’s “Must the Beginning of the Universe Have a Personal
Cause?”

> 1\. The universe hasn’t always existed.  
>  2\. The cause of the universe must be eternal (otherwise it, too, would
> have a beginning and would thus require a cause).  
>  3\. The cause of the universe must be either a personal agent or a non-
> personal sufficient condition (“mechanical cause”).  
>  4\. If “a causal condition sufficient for the production” of the universe
> exists from eternity, then the universe has always existed.  
>  5\. So the cause of the universe is not a non-personal sufficient
> condition.  
>  6\. The cause of the universe must therefore be a person.

2\. First Problem: It’s doubtful that Craig can consistently endorse (3).  
2.1When responding to the quantum indeterminacy objection to the causal
premise of the kalam argument, Craig glosses it in a way that it only requires
one or more necessary conditions for any coming to be.  
2.2 But if so, then to be consistent, Craig must allow the possibility of a
non- personal cause existing from eternity as a merely necessary condition for
the coming to be of the universe.  
2.3 And if that’s right, then Craig must allow for more than the two
candidates for the cause of the universe listed in (3).  
  
3\. Second Problem: Given (4), it’s not clear that positing a personal cause
will help Craig avoid concluding that the universe must be as eternal as its
cause.  
3.1 By (4), that can only be done if there is no eternal state of the divine
agent that is sufficient for causing the universe.  
3.2 Craig tries to avoid this implication with his eternal sitting man
analogy: It’s possible that an eternal man sits in a chair from eternity past,
and then decides or wills to freely stand up.  
3.3. Problem: The analogy breaks down when applied to God:  

3.3.1 He’s supposed to be omniscient, and thus knows from eternity what he
will do.

3.3.2 Prima facie, such knowledge includes his intention/will re: what he will
do.

3.3.3 But on standard views of an omnipotent will, God’s willing is sufficient
to produces its effect

3.3.4 So by (4), the universe should likewise be eternal.  
3.4 Craig’s reply: the intending/undertaking distinction: God’s “eternal
decision”/ _intention_ to create a universe with a beginning is eternal, but
his _undertaking_ to bring it about is not.  
3.5 Problem: This just pushes the problem back a step

3.5.2 So by Craig’s hypothesis that his intention to create is eternal, the
universe should likewise be eternal.  
3.6 One might think there is an easy way out here:

3.6.1 Craig says, not that God eternally decided to create a universe, but
that he eternally decided to create a universe with a beginning.

3.6.3 Problem solved.  
3.7 Reply: Craig can't consistently take this route

3.7.1 Such a claim, when combined with other claims Craig is committed to,
jointly entail a contradiction:

> 1\. alpha has a beginning.  
>  2\. God’s willing-to-create-alpha is eternal.  
>  3\. God’s willing-to-create-alpha is causally sufficient for the existence
> of alpha.  
>  4\. If a cause is eternal and sufficient for the existence of something,
> then that thing is also eternal (from (4) of the argument above).  
>  5\. If a thing is eternal then that thing doesn’t have a beginning.  
>  6\. Therefore, alpha both does and doesn’t have a beginning.

3.7.2 Something has to give, but the only ones which it is plausible to give
up are the ones Craig needs for stages 1 and 2 of his kalam argument, viz.,
(1) and (4).  
3.7.2.1 Craig needs (1) for stage 1 of the kalam argument  
3.7.2.2 (2) seems to follow from God’s eternality and omniscience.  
3.7.2.3 No one with standard views about God’s omnipotence will want to deny
(3)  
3.7.2.4 (4) might be resisted by saying that while God’s eternally willing
alpha makes the statement, “There is a world with a beginning” eternally true,
it doesn’t make the world eternal. But this isn’t a move that would help Craig
here.

3.7.2.4.1 For there seems no principled basis for denying this distinction for
a non-personal eternal sufficient condition for the beginning of the universe.

3.7.2.4.2 And if that’s right, then such a reply would undercut stage 2 of his
kalam argument.  
3.7.2.3 (5) is analytic (N.B. Is it? What about a 4d block universe?).  
  
4\. What went wrong in Craig’s reasoning? Morriston’s diagnosis:  
4.1 Craig is switching back and forth between two conceptions of eternity: (i)
beginningless and endless duration, and (ii) timelessness/atemporality.  
4.2 He needs conception (ii) to make sense of God’s existence and willing
being causally, but not temporally prior to the existence of the universe.  
4.3 But he also needs conception (i):

4.3.1 He needs it to make plausible the idea that God could eternally will a
universe with a beginning.  
4.3.2 He also needs it to explain why a non-personal cause couldn’t have
produced a universe with a beginning, as the effect would be as eternal as the
cause.  
4.4 But when you pin him down to either conception of eternity, the epistemic
advantage of personal causes over non-personal causes disappears:  
4.4.1 Re: (i) If large temporal gaps between the (eternal) will of a personal
cause and its effect is possible, why can’t the same be true of a non-personal
cause? It’s not at all clear that action at a temporal distance is any more
mysterious than action at a spatial distance. (Cf. his earlier discussion of
quantum indeterminacy and eternal necessary (but not sufficient) causal
conditions comes in.)  
4.4.2 Re: (ii) There can be no temporal gap between the timeless cause and the
effect with a personal cause, any more than there can with a non-personal
cause.

4.4.2.1 Craig’s freezing temperature/frozen water analogy breaks down at just
this point.

4.4.2.2 For an atemporal non-personal cause has no temporal duration at all,
and thus would not be freezing “for all eternity” (having no duration at all).

4.5 Craig therefore has no argument against the possibility of a timeless non-
personal cause.  
4.6 Craig might reply that non-personal causes can’t be atemporal, but:

4.6.2 In any case, the same sorts of grounds arise for the hypothesis of an
atemporal personal cause  
4.6.2.1 both are hard to make intelligible.  
4.6.2.2 both are contrary to all experience.

I would like something explained. I think perhaps others would like this
explained as well. You say:  
  
"First Problem: It’s doubtful that Craig can consistently endorse (3).  
2.1When responding to the quantum indeterminacy objection to the causal
premise of the kalam argument, Craig glosses it in a way that it only requires
one or more necessary conditions for any coming to be.  
2.2 But if so, then to be consistent, Craig must allow the possibility of a
non- personal cause existing from eternity as a merely necessary condition for
the coming to be of the universe.  
2.3 And if that’s right, then Craig must allow for more than the two
candidates for the cause of the universe listed in (3)."  
  
That may be true, but it seems p3 is basically saying either the origin has to
be personal or impersonal. There is no third option of which we are aware.
Perhaps Craig must allow the possibility of an eternal impersonal origin. Yet
there is no example in nature of anything not contingent that is impersonal.
What is really established by this point?

Hi Joe,  
  
The idea is that Craig sets up a dichotomy between libertarian personal causes
and mechanical non-personal causes, where the latter are such that the
presence of the relevant conditions are jointly sufficient for the effect to
obtain. The third option between the two is a non-personal cause that is only
a necessary, but not sufficient condition for its effect. An example might be
an indeterministic non-personal cause.  
  
About your other point: Wes' point is stated in section 4.6.2 in the notes,
viz., the same points apply to a timeless, bodiless personal cause (hard to
make intelligible, and we have no experience of one).  
  
Best,  
EA

Hi EA,  
  
Nice post. I mostly agree with Morriston. Regarding 3.7.2.3, that'a a good
point. I would say that Morriston's argument can be modified so that it does
not need analyticity. For example, one variant would be:  
  
3.7.2.3.': (5) is also needed for Craig's argument. The reason is that the
argument uses "eternal" (in his second premise) as equivalent to "existing
from eternity" (in the fourth premise). Else, the argument is invalid.  
  
Now, it might be argued that that's Morriston's reconstruction of Craig's KCA.
I doubt it, but just in case, here's another variant:  
  
3.7.2.3.'': (5) is necessarily true if time is tensed, and Craig needs tensed
time for this defense.  
  
I think 3.7.2.3.'' is very probable.

I see that in your next post you already pointed out that Craig needs (or at
least thinks he needs) tensed time for his argument. Sorry, I hadn't read that
post yet when I wrote my reply above, else I would have only suggested
3.7.2.3.' as another potential modification to Morriston's reply.

###  Yujin Nagasawa's Important New Book on Perfect Being Theism

Yujin Nagasawa's important book, _Maximal God: A New Defense of Perfect Being
Theism_ , is coming out in a few weeks. Here's the blurb:  

> Yujin Nagasawa presents a new, stronger version of perfect being theism, the
> conception of God as the greatest possible being. Although perfect being
> theism is the most common form of monotheism in the Judeo-Christian-Islamic
> tradition its truth has been disputed by philosophers and theologians for
> centuries. Nagasawa proposes a new, game-changing defence of perfect being
> theism by developing what he calls the 'maximal concept of God'. Perfect
> being theists typically maintain that God is an omniscient, omnipotent, and
> omnibenevolent being; according to Nagasawa, God should be understood rather
> as a being that has the maximal consistent set of knowledge, power, and
> benevolence. Nagasawa argues that once we accept the maximal concept we can
> establish perfect being theism on two grounds. First, we can refute nearly
> all existing arguments against perfect being theism simultaneously. Second,
> we can construct a novel, strengthened version of the modal ontological
> argument for perfect being theism. Nagasawa concludes that the maximal
> concept grants us a unified defence of perfect being theism that is highly

God and His Imaginary Friends: Acosmism, Pantheism and Priority Monism,
Pantheism, Panpsychism and Cosmopsychism  
  
Details  
  
Pantheism is the view that God is identical with the universe. Panentheism is
the view that the universe is part of God. These views are radically different
from traditional theism, which says that God is an all-powerful, all-loving
creator that is ontologically distinct from the universe. Pantheism and
panentheism have a long history since ancient Greece and many prominent
philosophers, theologians and scientists—such as Nicholas of Cusa, Baruch
Spinoza, John Locke, T. H. Green, Albert Einstein, and Stephen Hawking—have
defended or expressed sympathy with them. Yet, there has been very little
discussion of these views in philosophy and theology as they have focused
nearly exclusively on traditional theism.  
  
The aim of this workshop is to create opportunities for philosophers to
present their latest work on pantheism and panentheism to students and the
general public.  
  
The timetable for the workshop is:  
  
\-- 12.30 – 1.50: Yujin Nagasawa (University of Birmingham), "Pantheism,

## Is God the Best Explanation of Things? A Dialogue is Now Out!

The notion of ontological priority is all the rage these days, and many point
to Aristotle as the source of the notion as it is used today. However, even a
brief look at Aristotle's _Metaphysics_ reveals discussion of a wide variety
of notions of priority relations among entities. Therefore, in an effort to
get clearer on Aristotle's notion of ontological priority, I will here engage
in a preliminary exploration of Aristotle’s senses of priority, and then point
out ways in which he thought that an entity can be prior to and posterior to
another.

  
Before I begin, however, I must briefly discuss the entities that Aristotle
had in mind that could stand in the aforementioned relations of priority.
These entities are matter, form (or essence), and substance. Before we
consider these, however, let me note that it will be unavoidable that I use
the word ‘substance’ before I explicitly discuss it. But I believe we have a
rough and ready conception of substance that is sufficient for us to make due
until then. With that said, let’s now consider matter.

## Is God the Best Explanation of Things? A Dialogue is Now Out!

In this post, I’d like to sketch a new (or at least under-explored) version of
the problem of evil, which I will dub _the problem of teleological evil_.

To begin, let’s call something an instance of _teleological evil_ just in case
it’s an instance of suffering that occurs in virtue of the natural purpose or
design plan of a thing, i.e., it’s part of a thing’s design plan or one of its
natural purposes to cause other beings to suffer. A given instance of
teleological evil might ultimately trace back to one or more creaturely agents
(e.g., a human or a devil), but unless it does, let's say that it falls under
the more general category of natural evil.

It’s important not to confuse the problem of _teleological_ evil with the
problem of _dysteleology_. The latter problem traces back to Darwin’s
discussions of the imperfect design found in biological organisms and their
parts. Commonly discussed examples include the panda’s thumb, the inverted
retina, and the convolution of the sexual organs and the digestive organs in
humans. The problem of teleological evil differs from the problem of
dysteleology in that while the latter appeals to _poor_ design as evidence
against a supremely _intelligent_ designer, the former appeals to _good_
design (in particular, design that’s well-suited for causing suffering) as
evidence against a supremely _benevolent_ designer. To put it crudely, the
problem of dysteleology is the problem of _stupid_ design; the problem of
teleological evil is the problem of _malevolent_ design.

Perhaps the most obvious example of teleological evil is _the evil of
predation_. Such evil occurs when one or more organisms are “built” to cause
suffering to one or more other organisms by virtue of acting in accordance
with their design plans and/or natural purposes, such that it’s part of their
design plan to cause organisms to suffer in some way. And it is well known
that the suffering caused by the teleological evil of predation is immense.
Very, very many types of organisms are such that they aren’t able to get
enough nourishment unless they cause other organisms to suffer immensely (for
example, by ripping them to shreds and eating them alive). Vivid examples of
predatory teleological evil include:

Not all natural teleological evil is predatory evil, however. A ready example
can be found in the parasitic wasp just mentioned:  

Teleological evil appears to be a much more formidable problem for theism than
mere moral evil or non-teleological natural evil. Perhaps the most obvious
reason is that unlike teleological evil, moral and (non-teleological) natural
evil involve no clear or otherwise natural presumption that such evil was
intended by God. For when it comes to moral evil and other categories of
natural evil, there is always the possibility, and in some cases the
plausibility, that while God intended nature and autonomous agents to be good,
such agents misused their free will to cause evil, whether directly (in cases
of moral evil) or indirectly, by repurposing nature for evil ends (in cases of
natural evil). By contrast, with teleological evil, it is part of the very
design plan and natural purpose or function of an entity that it causes evil.
In such cases, it is natural to infer that if there is a god, then it is part
of the very intention of God to ensure horrific suffering, where this
suffering isn’t justified in virtue of being necessary to achieve some
outweighing good. For example, on the face of it, it seems that God could’ve
created a world containing only herbivores.  
  
Furthermore, such evil cannot be accounted for by the misuse of free will
(whether human or demonic). For free will defenses assume that nature is good
in itself, and that this good is subverted by being used for evil ends by
humans or devils. But while a free will defense might have at least a hint of
plausibility with respect to moral evil, the same cannot be said with respect
to an explanation of teleological evil. For the simplest hypothesis is that
such design and purpose was part of the original design plan of predatory
organisms.

_Objection_ : Creatures originally lacked evil teleology when God originally
made them, but they were later modified for evil ends.

_Reply_ : Such a hypothesis goes against what we have reason to believe about
evolutionary history, and in any case is a less parsimonious explanation than
a purely naturalistic hypothesis.

_Objection_ : The argument fails to appreciate the distinction between
_intending_ evil and _causing_ evil. For example, one might design a bathtub
with the aim of providing an environment in which to wash one’s body, and yet
foresee (but not intend) that some will accidentally drown in some of the
bathtubs they manufacture. Such a person isn’t clearly culpable for such
harms, as they were foreseen but not intended. Similarly, God might have
created all the entities at issue with non-malevolent aims, even though he
foresaw that they would sometimes result in great harms. God is thus likewise
morally off the hook for such harms.

_Reply_ : The argument grants _arguendo_ the truth of the moral relevance of
the causing/intending distinction. It just denies that the distinction helps
in the case of teleological evil found in nature. It’s extremely implausible
to deny that the large, sharp teeth and claws of a tiger are for ripping
through the flesh of their prey, and the same goes for the harm-causing
features of countless other species.

###  CfP: The Pantheism and Panentheism Project Summer Stipend Program

The Pantheism and Panentheism Project, funded by the John Templeton
Foundation, welcomes applications for summer stipends from scholars and
writers who wish to spend the summer writing a paper for publication in a
peer-reviewed academic journal, a reputable magazine (if they wish to write
for a popular audience), or an edited collection to be published by a leading
academic publisher. We offer £1000 each to 10 applicants in the summer of 2017
and 9 awards of £1000 each in the summer of 2018. Co-authors are welcome to
apply together but they will be awarded only one joint stipend of £1000.

Please email all of the above as a single PDF document by 15 April 2017 to
spinozawhitehead@gmail.com

The Pantheism and Panentheism Project focuses on the following three main
problems. Applicants are required to address at least one of these problems
directly or indirectly from a philosophical, historical, theological or
scientific perspective. It is not required that applicants defend pantheism or
panentheism. Applications from critics of these views are also welcome.

· The problem of personality: Pantheism and panentheism say that the cosmos is
identical with, is constituted by, or is part of God. This appears to suggest
that, contrary to the classical theistic view, God is not a person or a
personal being. Critics claim that this is problematic because a concept of
God that is non-personal does not seem to be adequate for theological
discourse. Can pantheists and panentheists respond to this problem by
developing a plausible account of personhood that makes the pantheistic or
panentheistic God qualify as a person or a personal being?

· The problem of unity: Classical theists maintain the doctrine of creation ex
nihilo, according to which God created the cosmos out of nothing. This
doctrine entails that God is ontologically distinct from the cosmos. Classical
theists face the following intractable question: How could God, who is
understood by classical theists as an incorporeal, timeless, changeless being,
create the cosmos, which consists of matter, time and space, out of nothing?
Pantheists and panentheists avoid such a question by maintaining that the
cosmos is not ontologically distinct from God. Yet it is not very clear how
the cosmos, which includes an extremely large number of entities, can be
considered a single, unified entity that can be described as divine. Can
pantheists and panentheists coherently maintain that the cosmos is a unified
whole?

· The problem of evil: Classical theists face the problem of evil because they
maintain that the cosmos, which includes apparently pointless pain and
suffering, was created by an all-powerful and all-good God. One of the main
virtues of pantheism and panentheism is that they do not face this problem.
Since they do not postulate the existence of an all-powerful and all-good God
the problem of evil for classical theists cannot be directed at them. However,
pantheism and panentheism do face a variation on the same problem: How could
the cosmos be identical with or be part of God if it contains apparently
gratuitous pain and suffering?

The selection criteria are (i) the quality of the abstract, (ii) relevance to
the project topics and (iii) the applicant’s publication track record.

## Is God the Best Explanation of Things? A Dialogue is Now Out!

One can find, through the writings of Lucretius, a powerful yet simple
Epicurean argument for matter's (factual or metaphysical) necessity. In
simplest terms, the argument is that since matter exists, and since nothing
can come from nothing (in the sense that everything with an originating or
sustaining efficient cause needs an originating or sustaining material cause,
respectively), matter is eternal and uncreated. The argument can be
strengthened in light of the scientific evidence for the conservation laws,
according to which it’s at least _physically_ impossible that matter-energy is
created or destroyed. And if there are no supernatural beings that can
annihilate matter-energy, the latter is at least _de facto_ indestructible.
Therefore, given the uncreated, eternal, and _de facto_ indestructibility of
matter-energy, it follows that matter-energy (or if matter-energy isn’t
fundamental, whatever matter-energy is ultimately made of) is at least a
_factually_ necessary being.[1]

A stronger version of Epicurus' core argument can be developed by adding an
appeal to something in the neighborhood of origin essentialism. The basic line
of reasoning is that if being uncreated is a property of matter-energy in the
actual world, then it is an _essential_ property of matter-energy, in which
case matter-energy in the actual world is _essentially_ uncreated.

Yet stronger versions of the argument can go on from what is said above by
appealing to a strong version of the principle of sufficient reason to argue
that whatever plays the role of being eternal, essentially uncreated, and
indestructible does not vary from possible world to possible world. But if
not, then matter is a _metaphysically_ necessary being.[2] On any version of
the argument, however, we seem to get the conclusion that the universe
requires no external sustaining cause, in which case, _a fortiori_ , God is
not required to play such a role.

The broadly Epicurean line of reasoning above can be seen as a cosmological
argument of sorts, but one that concludes that matter-energy (or its ultimate
constituents), and not an immaterial creator, is the uncaused cause of
contingent, dependent, concrete reality. Let us therefore call any argument
that deploys a material-cause version of the principle _ex nihilo nihil fit_
to infer the factual or metaphysical necessity of matter (or matter's ultimate
constituents) an _Epicurean cosmological argument_.

If successful, Epicurean cosmological arguments can be used to provide
evidence in support of atheism over theism. For such arguments provide _prima
facie_ evidence that matter-energy (or its ultimate constituents) are
factually or metaphysically necessary. But if so, then since it’s constitutive
of classical theism that God is the creator of any material universe that
happens to exist, then since an _essentially_ uncreated universe exists in the
_actual_ world, and since essentially uncreated universes cannot, by
definition, be created, it follows that the God of classical theism does not
exist. Indeed, if, as many classical theists assert, God exists necessarily if
he exists at all, then given that he doesn’t exist in the actual world, God
exists in _no_ possible world. In other words, God’s existence is
metaphysically impossible.

## Is God the Best Explanation of Things? A Dialogue is Now Out!

If lacking the ability to do wrong thereby makes a person a robot, then the
God of classical theism is thereby a robot. But if the lack of ability to do
wrong does not thereby make a person a robot, then finite creaturely agents
who lack such an ability are not thereby rendered robots.

Hello,  
  
I have two remarks. First, is the "lack of ability to do wrong" meant as
"metaphysical impossibility to do wrong"? That would exclude not only
libertarian but also compatibilist freedom in this respect.  
Second, I think that the problem lies not with being able or unable to do
wrong, but with being subject to moral evaluation in general. If God is not
able to do wrong in the sense that it is metaphysically impossible for God to
do wrong, then moral vocabulary does not apply to God. What follows is that
being a person is not essentially connected to being subject to moral
evaluation.  
  
All the best,  
Stanisław

A follow-up comment: You assertion seems to be the perfect starting point for
developing a version of the argument from evil.  
  
1\. What needs to be proved, I think, is that it would be possible for God to
create persons which (metaphysically) cannot do what is wrong (perhaps this
ability goes hand in hand with being created).  
  
2\. The world without persons who can do what is wrong would not be a
*morally* perfect world, however, it could be perfect in some other sense
(perhaps in the sense that everybody in this world would enjoy the communion
with God). Let's call this soteriological perfection.  
  
3\. One would have to prove then that is God can actualize the
soteriologically perfect world then God does actualize it.

Perhaps appeal to a distinction between Creator and creature here?  
  
Perhaps only a Trinitarian conception of God can account for something like a
real choice of loving surrender in the Godhead making the Persons of the
Trinity pass the test of being non-robotic in an analagous way to humans yet
divinely distinct (via analogia entis)?  
  
(It's amusing to note that this website requires me to click a box that says
'I am not a robot' in order to post this comment!)

###  CfP: Inquiry: New Work on the Existence of God

In recent years, methods and concepts in logic, metaphysics and epistemology
have become more and more sophisticated. For example, much new, subtle and
interesting work has been done on modality, grounding, explanation and
infinity, in both logic, metaphysics as well as epistemology. The three
classical arguments for the existence of God – ontological arguments,
cosmological arguments and fine-tuning arguments – all turn on issues of
modality, grounding, explanation and infinity. In light of recent work, these
arguments can - and to some extent have - become more sophisticated as well.
_Inquiry_ hereby calls for new and original papers in the intersection of
recent work in logic, metaphysics and epistemology and the three main types of
arguments for the existence of God.

###  Divine Command Theory and the Free Will Defense: A Tension

A common line of reasoning in response to the problem of evil is (very
roughly) that free will is an exceedingly great good, but God can't give us
this good without thereby preventing the possibility of our misusing it and
causing evil in the world. My concern here is not whether the free will
defense is a successful defeater for the problem of evil, but rather whether
it fits well with a popular theistic view of meta-ethics, viz., divine command
theory.

To see the worry, start with a crude version of divine command theory,
according to which all moral properties, including both moral values and moral
duties, are grounded in God's decrees. On such a view, God can confer moral
value or moral worth on anything he likes by mere decree, in which case free
will isn't intrinsically valuable, in which case God's ability to bring about
the greatest goods isn't dependent upon creating creatures with free will, in
which case the free will defense looks to be in big trouble.

  
One might reply that the problem raised above can be avoided by appealing to a
more sophisticated version of divine command theory, such as the modified
version developed and defended by Robert Adams and others. However, it's not
at all clear that this will be of help to the theist in addressing our worry.
For while it's true that moral value or moral worth doesn't depend upon God's
will on this latter sort of view, it does depend upon God's nature, such that
something has moral worth or moral goodness just to the extent that it
resembles God's nature. But the problem is that God doesn't have the kind of
free will in play in the free will defense. This is because God is essentially
morally perfect, in which case there is no possible world at which God freely
does something morally wrong. But if that's right, then the kind of free will
attributed to humans in the free will defense doesn't resemble the kind of
agency had by God. In fact, Adams-style modified divine command theory seems
to have the implication that creatures with a kind of will incapable of
performing morally wrong actions have greater moral value or worth than
creatures that are capable of performing them. And if that's right, then the
free will defense looks to be in just as much trouble when conjoined with
modified divine command theory as it does when paired with the crude version.

###  New Paper on Modal Fictionalism and the Ontological Argument

Ted Parent offers a powerful critique of the modal ontological argument in his
paper, "The Modal Ontological Argument Meets Modal Fictionalism", _Analytic
Philosophy_ (forthcoming). Here is the abstract:

> This paper attacks the modal ontological argument, as advocated by Plantinga
> among others. Whereas other criticisms in the literature reject one of its
> premises, the present line is that the argument is invalid. This becomes
> apparent once we run the argument assuming fictionalism about possible
> worlds. Broadly speaking, the problem is that if one defines “x” as
> something that exists, it does not follow that there is anything satisfying
> the definition. Yet unlike non-modal ontological arguments, the modal
> argument commits this “existential fallacy” not in relation to the
> definition of ‘God’. Rather, it occurs in relation to the modal facts
> quantified over within a Kripkean modal logic. In brief, we can describe the
> modal facts by whichever logic we prefer—yet it does not follow that there
> are genuine modal facts, as opposed to mere facts-according-to-the-fiction.
> A broader consequence of the discussion is that the existential fallacy is
> an issue for many projects in “armchair metaphysics.”

_Second objection_ : There are final causes in God's nature that are
ontologically prior to his intelligent agency. For example, God's intellect
and will work together to perform various functions, such as designing and
creating things. God's life is also meaningful and purposeful according to
classical theism. On classical theism, therefore, final causes are built into
God's nature without a prior cause. But if that's right, then classical theism
entails the existence of final causes at the metaphysical ground floor that
God cannot create. And if that's right, then theism entails that non-conscious
teleology is a more fundamental feature of reality than teleology caused by
intelligence. And if that's right, then we'd expect base-level teleology in
the universe that's not caused by God on the hypothesis of theism. Therefore,
absent a _further_ reason for thinking cosmic fine-tuning isn't expected
unless caused by a divine fine-tuner, cosmic fine-tuning doesn't confirm
theism vis-a-vis naturalism.

###  Toward a Plausible Framework for Doing Philosophy of Religion

Smilansky, Saul. " Reversing Pascal's Wager: Scepticism About Religious Belief

## Is God the Best Explanation of Things? A Dialogue is Now Out!

There is a long tradition in theistic philosophy of religion of appealing to
God as the ultimate ground or architect of final causes -- of purpose, plan,
and function -- found in nature. A key rationale behind this appeal is that
final causes have an intelligent source as part of their nature or essence.
This rationale appears to be at work in a wide range of arguments for God.
Examples include design arguments, arguments from reason, arguments from
intentionality, and arguments from life-meaning and purpose.

Here's the rub: There are final causes in _God's nature_ that are
ontologically prior to his intelligent agency. For example, God's intellect
and will work together to perform various functions, such as designing and
creating things. God's life is also meaningful and purposeful according to
classical theism. On classical theism, therefore, _final causes are built into
God's nature without a prior cause_. But if that's right, then classical
theism entails the existence of final causes at the metaphysical ground floor
that God cannot create. And if that's right, then theism entails base-level
final causes that do not require intention.

The moral: _Theism entails that non-conscious teleology is a more fundamental
feature of reality than teleology caused by intelligence_ , in which case it's
not at all clear why base-level final causes are problematic for naturalism
vis-a-vis theism.

in which case classical theism entails the existence of purpose that God

teleology is more fundamental than teleology caused by intelligence --, in
which case it's not clear why purpose in the universe without intention is

###  Review of Schellenberg's _The Hiddenness Argument: Philosophy's New
Challenge to Belief in God_

It's a great book and I think it's important because of two issues that arise
when I have used the argument myself. (1) One is to detail why it is not just
another formulation of the POE, something which the reviewer notes and says
summarizes nicely. (2) It also pins down the fact that nonresistant nonbelief
is the term to use, not reasonable unbelief or the like.  
  
I do wish more attention was given to discharging the contention that
nonresistant nonbelievers do not exist. I know the more concerning responses
Schellenberg interacts with don't take such a stance but it is a very common
contention among a wide range of theists. Recently William Lane Craig denied
their existence so there's at least an apologetic tactical issue that might
stand in the way of popularizing the argument for a wider audience.

In this article, I outline the major themes of ‘anti-theodicy’. Anti-theodicy
is characterised as a reaction, as rejection, against traditional solutions to
the problem of evil (called ‘theodicies’) and against the traditional
formulations of the problem of evil to which those solutions respond. I detail
numerous ‘moral’ anti-theodical objections to theodicy, illustrating the
central claim of anti-theodicy: Theodicy is morally objectionable. I also
detail some ‘non-moral’ anti-theodical objections, illustrating the second
major claim of anti-theodicy: Traditional formulations of the problem of evil
are conceptually misguided. My focus remains on the analytic philosophical
tradition throughout, but I briefly allude to the rich theological tradition
of anti-theodicy. Although we should recognise the significant degree of
diversity amongst anti-theodical arguments and the philosophical views of
their proponents, this article should serve to illustrate the general theme:
‘Theodicies mediate a praxis that sanctions evil.

Hi EA  
  
While I'd agree that, after reflection, belief in God's existence isn't
justified, I'm not sure about some of Mizrahi's arguments:  
  
With respect to a posteriori arguments, the paper seems to imply that there is
no possible empirical observations based on which one should regard God's
existence as more or less probable. But God, if he existed, would be morally
perfect. That provides some info about his psychology, and so some
observations - e.g., all of the suffering in the world - may count against it
- and I think they do.  
  
That God is supernatural (by that I mean what Mizrahi means in the paper),
unobservable, etc., doesn't seem to preclude that. For example, we have
empirical evidence against the existence of, say, an omnipotent, omniscient,
supernatural being D who necessarily values the non-existence of predators
above all else: our empirical observations that there are predators count
against D (even if one consistently hold that D exists and is hiding by giving
us false observations, but theory is always underdetermined by observations).  
  
Perhaps, Mizrahi is using the word "God" in a different way, so that we may
not make psychological inferences. In that case, it seems more plausible that
there is no empirical observation that would help - but it's no problem for an
non-theist who argues against a morally perfect, omnipotent omniscient
creator.  
  
As for a priori arguments, Mizrahi seems to equate them to conceptual
arguments. But that's at least controversial. For example, a priori one can
tell that it's immoral for people to torture others for fun. Is that a
conceptual truth? Some theories (e.g., analytical descriptivism) imply it is,
but that's controversial.  
  
Also, there is the issue of intuitive probabilistic assessments. They are (I
think) a priori, but not conceptual. In any case, they seem to be sometimes
sufficient for knowledge. For example, someone may posit a logically
consistent skeptical hypothesis SH10 that holds that the universe was created
10 minutes ago, we got fake memories, etc., and we were made by an omnipotent
being who wants to hide from us, making it look like the universe is old, etc.  
There is no conceptual argument against SH10 as far as I can tell, and I don't
think that there is an empirical one, either (given how SH10 is constructed,
it looks unfalsifiable to me).  
However, it seems reasonable to me to assign an extremely low probability to
SH10 (don't we know that SH10 is false?).  
  
This isn't to say that some observations or a priori arguments would justify
theistic belief: maybe no a priori arguments would help, and a posteriori
arguments might at best justify increasing a (human) person's proper
probabilistic assignment to the God hypothesis, but remaining very low.

Not even slightly persuaded by this paper. But I wanted to point out this
snippet which I thought was humorous:  
  
"In terms of unification, the natural (psychotropic drugs or weak magnetic
fields) and the  
supernatural (God) explanations seem to account for the phenomena of religious  
experience equally well."  
  
The sort of religious experiences I am familiar with from the first person
perspective being accounted for by weak magnetic fields strikes me as ....
weak. My friends who do LSD have told me that when they are sober, they are
atheists, and when on LSD they are theists. Of course there's something to the
idea that religious experiences can be caused by drugs. Except, you know, when
there aren't drugs.

According to a strong and unrestricted version of the principle of sufficient
reason, everything that exists or occurs has a sufficient reason for its
existence or occurrence, where sufficient reasons are taken to entail or
necessitate the existence or occurrence of the entity in question. For our
purposes, call this version _PSR_.

Peter van Inwagen famously argued that PSR is implausible, as it entails that
everything exists or occurs of metaphysical necessity, and that this is absurd
(since many things seem to be contingent and not necessary). Call this _the
PvI objection_. Now people tend to react to the PvI objection in one of three
ways:

(i) Hold on to PSR, while accepting that it entails everything exists or
occurs of metaphysical necessity.

(ii) Restrict PSR so as to make conceptual space for things to occur
contingently.

(iii) Reject PSR in order to make conceptual space for things to occur
contingently.

(iv) Hold on to PSR and its implication that everything exists or occurs of
metaphysical necessity, but deny that it entails that everything exists in
_our universe_ exists or occurs of necessity in _all_ universes.

  
To motivate this option, note that the PvI objection gets most of its bite by
assuming that  

> 1\. O _ur universe_ is the only universe that exists at the actual world.

For then it seems to follow from (1) and the PvI objection that  

> 2\. Whatever exists or occurs in _our_ universe at the _actual_ world exists
> or occurs in _all possible universes_ at _all possible worlds_.

However, if it's possible that there is a _multiverse_ comprising an infinite
number of universes (where these are sufficiently diverse so as to capture our
modal intuitions about the space of metaphysical possibilities), then this
inference doesn't go through.  
  
Option (iv) exploits the epistemic possibility of a multiverse of the sort
sketched above to block the inference from (1) and the PvI objection to (2).
Those who take this option grant that PSR entails that everything exists or
occurs of metaphysical necessity, in the sense that the multiverse at the
actual world exists at all possible worlds. However, they deny that all that
exists or occurs in _our_ tiny corner of the multiverse exists or occurs at
_all other_ universes within the multiverse. In this way, they deflate the
epistemic significance of the intuition of contingency that gives the PvI
objection its bite. By choosing option (iv), then, one can have one's
explanatory cake and eat it, too.  
  
I'm not saying that option (iv) doesn't raise questions of its own. (E.g.,
does it commit one to Lewisian modal realism and/or counterpart theory? Etc.,
etc.). All I'm saying is that (iv) is an option that's no worse off than the
others, and that it's not clear that it fares worse than PvI's option in terms
of a theoretical cost-benefit analysis between the respective views. At a
minimum, it's an option that deserves more consideration than it has hitherto
received.

Ex: Nice post. How about a fifth option?  
  
(v) Hold on to PSR but deny that it entails that everything exists or occurs
of metaphysical necessity.  
  
Given any state of the universe S1, PSR entails that S1 is necessitated by
some other state of the universe S2 ("some other state" because no state of
the universe necessitates itself). S2, in turn, is necessitated by some state
of the universe S3. And so on _ad infinitum_. No state of the universe is
thereby made metaphysically necessary, full stop, only metaphysically
necessary _given_ some other state. Contingency preserved: _any_ state of the
universe would have been different had some other state been different.  
  
This explanation entails an infinitely old universe (fine by me and better
than the alternative), or else the past states of the universe "telescope"
into a finite period of time, as Quentin Smith has suggested.  
  
"But why are there are any states of the universe at all?" As I've argued
elsewhere, that question is either ill-posed or else answered by invoking any
state of the universe. Nothing is left inexplicable.

Hi, Steve.  
  
I'm inclined to think the option you sketch above (and flesh out in some of
your recent work) is another live epistemic possibility. More trouble for the
PvI objection to PSR!  
  
Best,  
EA

This is similar to a view I've argued for in Theism and Plenitude, but not on
the assumption of a multiverse. Lewis's pluriverse is not a multiverse. Other
universes exist for Lewis (other worlds exist) only on an unrestricted use of
'exists' and none of those other worlds/universes is actual. Multiverse
theorists maintain on the other hand that the other universes actually exist.
Instead of having God actualize a universe or a multiverse, you have God
actualize a pluriverse--all of metaphysical space. This requires the rejection
of counterpart theory for God--you don't have a different God existing in each
world--but rather you have God exist _from the standpoint of_ each world while
_existing in_ no possible world at all. You still get necessitarianism, since
God's creation (all worlds and all possibilia) exists necessarily under
unrestricted quantification, but you also get contingency preserved, under
restricted quantification. Necessitarianism is thus compatible with
contingency. The bonus is that the principle of plenitude is also satisfied.

###  Metaphysically Necessary Beings, Factually Necessary Beings, and Two
Kinds of Brute Facts

I've argued for the live epistemic possibility that matter/energy (or, if
matter/energy isn't fundamental, the stuff of which matter/energy is
ultimately composed) is factually necessary. That is, it's a live epistemic
possibility that while there might be possible worlds at which matter/energy
does not exist, it's eternal, uncaused, existentially independent, and _de
facto_ indestructible at the actual world. I've also argued that factually
necessary matter/energy satisfies a weaker version of PSR:

> (PSRfn): Every existing thing has an explanation of its existence, either in
> terms of the factual necessity of its own nature or in terms of an external
> cause.

Finally, I've attempted to motivate this proposal and answer a number of
objections to it on various occasions. Here, however, I'd like to set aside
these points and defend PSRfn by means of a _tu quoque_ argument of sorts.
Here's a thumbnail sketch of the argument: A number of proponents of the
principle of sufficient reason (PSR) have accepted a revised version that
allows for brute facts of certain sorts, on the grounds that unrestricted
versions of PSR lead to absurdities, or conflict with other things we have
reason to accept. And because of this, they reason, such revisions, and the
resultant acceptance of certain sorts of brute facts, are acceptable. But (I
argue) if such a basis for revising and restricting PSR (and thereby allowing
for certain sorts of brute facts) is acceptable, then by the same token, so is
the basis for further revising PSR to PSRfn, and, consequently, granting the
acceptability of the brute existence of a factually necessary being.  
  
Of course the key move in the argument is following recent proponents of PSR
in accepting a distinction between between objectionably vs. unobjectionably
brute facts. Here's a quick sketch and illustration of the distinction:

1\. Objectionable: there is no explanation of a contingent fact, and there is
no good reason to accept this.

-Example: an iPhone pops into existence without any cause whatsoever. 

2\. Unobjectionable: there is no sufficient reason for a contingent fact, but
there is a good independent reason to accept this.

(a) Assuming that x has a sufficient reason for its existence or occurrence
leads to an apparent absurdity.

-Example: Such an assumption entails that everything exists or obtains of absolute 

necessity, that we lack free will, that quantum indeterminacy isn't real, etc.

(b) Assuming that x has a sufficient reason for its existence or occurrence
conflicts with other things we have reason to accept.

-Example: Such an assumption conflicts with (say) _a priori_ and/or _a posteriori_ evidence that no being is metaphysically necessary.

Here's my claim: Positing that there is no sufficient reason for why an
independent being exists beyond the factual necessity of its own nature, and
is thus a brute fact, is of an unobjectionable sort. In particular, it's a
brute fact of type 2(b), since assuming the contrary conflicts with something
else that we have reason to believe, viz., that no being is metaphysically
necessary. Here are three reasons one might offer for thinking that no being
is metaphysically necessary:  
  
(i) _Modal evidence_ : We have modal intuitions that for any being, there are
worlds at which it doesn’t exist.  
  
(ii) _Abductive evidence_ : our extensive experience of an extremely wide
variety of concrete objects is such that we find them all to be contingent.
What explains this? The simplest, most conservative explanation of the data
with the widest explanatory scope is the hypothesis that all concrete objects
are contingent beings.  
  
(iii) O _rigin essentialism_ : Widely shared intuitions support the Kripkean
thesis that objects have their origins of metaphysical necessity: for any
world W and objects x, y, and z, if x was produced by y and z at W, then x was
produced by y and z at every other world W' at which x exists. So by
implication, if an eternal universe lacks an origin at the _actual_ world,
then it lacks an origin at _every_ world. And if that's right, then it's
metaphysically impossible for such a universe to have a further explanation
for its existence.  
  
For at least these reasons, then, the existence of a factually necessary
universe is unobjectionably brute, since assuming the contrary conflicts with
other things we have reason to accept.

###  Craig On Causal Candidates for the Origin of the Universe

(Very rough draft)  
  
Leaving aside formal and final causes, there appear to be four possible
scenarios for the origin of our universe:

_At this point, one might quite reasonably object that a beginning to the
expansion of the universe (or multiverse) doesn't entail a beginning to the
existence of the universe (or multiverse). For the universe could've existed
in a quiescent state. However, Craig has argued that such a purely
naturalistic quiescent universe can be ruled out on the grounds that it would
be in an state of absolute rest, from which no event could arise (barring
supernatural intervention). However, Wes Morriston has argued persuasively
that a similar worry arises for the hypothesis of the creation of the universe
by a God who is quiescent prior to the creation of the universe. If so, then
neither the theistic hypothesis nor the quiescent naturalistic universe
hypothesis has an epistemic advantage over the other. Therefore, (iii) seems
to be at least on an epistemic par with (ii)._  
  
I agree with this. But I'm still bothered by both (ii) and (iii). Both options
still have the oddity of the universe arising from either a natural or
supernatural quiescent state. It almost seems preferable to go with option (i)
and have an infinite regress if one rejects, as I do, the arguments against
the existence of an actual infinite.

Hi EA,  
  
Just a brief comment, and a question:  
  
1\. There is a further worry about iii. If space, or time, spacetime, etc.,
had a material cause M, wouldn't M also be part (or a state, etc.; I don't
mean for this to have a mereological commitment) of the universe, in the sense
of "universe" that is used by Craig?  
If this is so, then it seems to me iii. can be ruled out on conceptual
grounds.  
Or maybe Craig's usage of "universe" is just not precise enough to be properly
used in the context in which he intends to use it. I don't know.  
  
2\. Do you have any reference where Craig grants that (iv) is unobjectionable
if the universe is a 4-dimensional block of some sort?  
My impression is that he grants that this avoids the intuition that everything
that begins to exist has a cause of its existence, but the argument from
contingency still works.

Ms. De Cruz, thank you for addressing this relevant problem.  
  
You can't be faulted for narrowing your study to philosophers of religion. But
the problem extends to all philosophers and even scientists.  
  
A few things must be clarified:  
The 1st question: Whether philosophers of religion are inﬂuenced by irrelevant
factors, is both empirical and epistemological (in the sense that what they
claim to know, and how they claim to know it, are inﬂuenced by irrelevant
factors).  
The 2nd question: Whether the inﬂuence of irrelevant factors on our
philosophical views should worry us is not epistemological. It's axiological.  
  
Most people don't even know that emotion is detrimental to probability
judgment.

Drivel. This is a verbiage bubble built on the absence of a definition of "the
right kind of evidence". Define that term, and the question of the rationality
of belief in God (by whatever definition) is answered. Neglect to define that
term, and you grant yourself a bogus license to wax eloquent on what any
number of other people have said about a question that has not been properly
asked.

Cary, are you aware of Feyerabend's attacks on there being a single, well-
definable 'scientific method'—which is probably what you'd use to identify
"the right kind of evidence"? We find his criticisms well-accepted by
naturalist Penelope Maddy in her _Second Philosophy: A Naturalistic Method_ :

So it's not clear that "the right kind of evidence" can be defined in the way
you intimate. Indeed, I wonder if you're headed toward some kind of
philosophical foundationalism.

###  CfP: Explaining Religion: Cognitive Science of Religion and Naturalism

Organizers: Hans van Eyghen, Rik Peels, and Gijsbert van den Brink

Although Cognitive Science of Religion (CSR) is still a rather young
discipline, its main theories have been the subject of considerable debate.
One main point of discussion is whether cognitive theories explain religion.
The title of Pascal Boyer’s book Religion Explained (2002) signals that at
least one goal of CSR is to explain religion. Many authors have interpreted
‘explaining’ as explaining away and have argued that CSR-theories have not
explained religion away because the truth of religion is compatible with the
main theories in CSR.

This workshop will focus on a different question, viz. whether CSR-theories
allow for a natural explanation of religion, where a natural explanation is a
scientific one that does not involve anything supernatural or spooky. When it
relies on the principle of parsimony (Occam’s Razor), a natural explanation of
religion makes the existence of anything supernatural superfluous . Daniel
Dennett already suggested something along these lines in his 2006 book
Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon. Since then, few scholars

I agree. And I'm a monotheist. So are you an atheist? If you said so
somewhere, I missed it.

Why do you say that "The creation of a universe ex nihilo is metaphysically
impossible"?

Saying that _ex nihilo creation_ of concrete objects is possible with enough

I don't see why matter is a brute fact or necessary being if it's distinct
from God. Can you flesh that out? It doesn't seem to be a required
consequence. It's distinct from God, and came into being at a particular time.

Hi MontJoie,  
  
Yes, there is room within logical space for such a view: God could've created
the reservoir of energy within himself ex nihilo. I was going to add it, but
ultimately left it out, as it reduces to the other options already represented
on the chart. For it just reduces to classical theism. And the problem with
such a view reduces to the same problem with the version of creation ex nihilo
represented on the chart, viz., that creation of a reservoir of energy within
God ex nihilo is on an epistemic par with such a reservoir coming into
existence uncaused out of nothing.

RC Sproul's mentor the late John Gersner saw this very problem that you bring
up and said the only logically consistent position was panentheism. If I
remember correctly I believe Gersner said he noticed the problem by reading
Jonathan Edwards who he claimed was also a peanentheist.

## Is God the Best Explanation of Things? A Dialogue is Now Out!

The long version of the argument is for another day, but here's the short
version. Consider the following principle, which I'll call the Impossibility
of Uncaused Concrete Objects (IUC):

> (IUC) It's metaphysically impossible for a concrete object to come into
> existence if it has neither an efficient nor a material cause.

IUC is just an instance of the more general principle, _ex nihilo nihil fit._
And as far as widely accepted metaphysical principles go, the latter is about
as good as it gets. And rightly so. Not only does it seem self-evident, but
all of nature appears to conform to it without exception.

However, some philosophers are still skeptical. Philosophers in this camp tend
to sympathize with Hume that anything that can be imagined or conceived
without contradiction is prima facie metaphysically possible. And since one
can imagine, say, a quark -- or even the whole universe -- popping into
existence uncaused out of nothing, and can do so without a contradiction in
one's conception, that's enough to call the principle into question. On the
basis of this line of reasoning, philosophers of this stripe take it to be a
live possibility that _ex nihilo nihil fit_ is false, and thus that it's a
live possibility that the universe popped into existence uncaused, out of
nothing.

> (PMC) It's metaphysically impossible for a concrete object to come into
> existence by an efficient cause if it lacks a material cause.

PMC looks to be on an epistemic par with IUC. Both seem self-evident, and both
enjoy the support of universal experience. However, neither principle is
analytic, and so one can deploy the Humean gambit above to resist them if one
is so inclined.  
  
Given that IUC and PMC are in the same epistemological boat, therefore, it
seems unprincipled and arbitrarily selective to accept one while rejecting the
other. Therefore, it looks as though one should treat them similarly: either
accept both, or use the Humean gambit to reject both.  
  
Here's the rub. Either option entails the falsity of classical Anselmian
theism. For consider the first option: accept both principles. If you do that,
then you accept PMC, in which case you accept something that entails that God
can't create concrete objects _ex nihilo_ , in which case you accept something
that entails that classical Anselmian theism is false. On the other hand,
suppose you reject both principles. Then you reject IUC, in which case you
accept that there is a possible world at which concrete objects pop into
existence out of nothing without a cause. But since classical Anselmian theism
entails that God is the creator or sustainer of all concrete objects outside
himself in all possible worlds in which he exists, you accept something that
entails the falsity of classical Anselmian theism. Therefore, either way, you
accept something that entails the falsity of classical Anselmian theism.

In short, the conclusion goes through whether you accept PMC or not.

In the past I have written comments in support of your arguments in this vein.
When I first read this one, I thought it was excellent. However, on further
reflection, I think that there may be a problem with this argument:  
  
The 'uncaused' in IUC is ambiguous. Suppose it means efficient cause. Then IUC
is:  
  
IUC1= It is metaphysically impossible for concrete objects to come into
existence without an efficient cause, out of nothing.  
  
The comma here suggests conjunction. Thus IUC1 says (a) a concrete object
cannot come into existence without an efficient cause; and (b) a concrete
object cannot come into existence out of nothing.  
  
An Anselmian theist has to think that IUC1 is false since, as you argue, an
Anselmian theist believes that (b) is false. But notice that, in rejecting
IUC1, the Anselmian does not have to accept that (a) is false. Indeed,
presumably Anselmians think that (a) is true.  
  
But notice that the falsity of IUC1 does not entail that there is a
metaphysically possible world in which concrete objects can pop into existence
uncaused out of nothing. Why? Because, so long as (a) is true, it is
impossible for for an object to pop into existence without an efficient cause.  
  
Suppose, however, that "uncaused" in IUC refers to material cause. Then IUC
becomes:  
  
IUC2 = It is metaphysically impossible for concrete objects to come into
existence without a material cause, out of nothing.  
  
In this case the comma does not represent conjunction (the clause after the
comma is classificatory, in this case). Presumably, the Anselmian theist will
claim that IUC2 is false for the same reasons that she thinks that PMC is
false. However, the falsity of IUC2 does not entail that there is a
metaphysically possible world in which concrete objects can pop into existence
without a cause, for it does not entail that there is a metaphysically
possible world in which concrete objects can pop into existence without an
efficient cause.  
  
The upshot is that an Anselmian can reject IUC without contradiction. God, on
this view, is the final efficient cause. The Anselmian says that it is
impossible for an object to pop into existence without an efficient cause, but
it is possible for a concrete object to begin to exist without a material
cause. I think that Anselmians can reject IUC and still maintain this  
  

Hi Jason!  
  
Thanks for pushing me to clarify. I intend  
  
(IUC) It's metaphysically impossible for concrete objects to come into
existence uncaused, out of nothing.  
  
to be glossed as:  
  
(IUC') It's metaphysically impossible for concrete objects to come into
existence if they have neither an efficient nor a material cause.  
  
I'll revise the post in light of your helpful comment.  
  
The idea is that both PMC and IUC' are in the same epistemological boat, in
that: (a) both are supported by a strong rational intuition (at least on
reflection), and (b) both are supported by universal experience. However, (c)
both are non-analytic propositions. Therefore, (d), both are susceptible to
non-acceptance via the Humean gambit.  
  
I should emphasize that the worry I'm raising is not that the theist
contradicts herself by accepting one principle while rejecting the other.
Rather the point is that in accepting one principle while rejecting the other,
the theist is doing so in a way that's arbitrary or unprincipled. But if they
adopt a principled stance by either accepting both principles or rejecting
both principles, either option entails the falsity of classical Anselmian
theism.  
  
All best,  
EA

Is this an accurate formulation of your dilemma?  
  
(1) Neither IUC nor PMC are analytic propositions.  
  
(2) Both IUC and PMC seem self-evident and are supported by universal
experience.  
  
(3) There are no other relevant factors which bear upon the support for IUC
and PMC.  
  
(4) Therefore, IUC and PMC are equally probable.  
  
(5) Therefore, either both IUC and PMC are true or neither are. [from (4)]  
  
(6) If both IUC and PMC are true, then God cannot create concrete objects ex
nihilo. [from the definition of PMC]  
  
(7) If God cannot create concrete objects ex nihilo, then classical Anselmian
theism is false.  
  
(8) If both IUC and PMC are false, then there is a possible world in which
concrete objects pop into existence uncaused.  
  
(9) If there is a possible world in which concrete objects pop into existence
uncaused, then classical Anselmian theism is false.  
  
(10) Therefore, classical Anselmian theism is false.[from (7) and (9)]

Hi Jeff,  
  
In dialectical contexts involving theists, I'm inclined to couch the dilemma
in terms of epistemic defeat. Something like:  
  
(1) Neither IUC nor PMC are analytic propositions.  
  
(2) Both IUC and PMC are equally intuitive and supported by universal
experience.  
  
(3) There are no other relevant epistemic factors that bear upon the support
for IUC and PMC.  
  
(4) If (1)-(3) are true, then one rationally ought to either accept both IUC
and PMC or reject both IUC and PMC.  
  
(5) Therefore, one rationally ought to either accept both IUC and PMC or
reject both IUC and PMC. [From (1)-(4)]  
  
(6) If one rationally ought to accept both IUC and PMC, then one rationally
ought to accept that God cannot create concrete objects ex nihilo.  
  
(7) If one rationally ought to accept that God cannot create concrete objects
ex nihilo, then classical Anselmian theism is defeated.  
  
(8) Therefore, if one rationally ought to accept both IUC and PMC, then
classical Anselmian theism is defeated. [From (6) and (7)]  
  
(9) If one rationally ought to reject both IUC and PMC, then one rationally
ought to accept that it’s at least a live epistemic possibility that there is
a metaphysically possible world at which concrete objects pop into existence
out of nothing without a cause.  
  
(10) If one rationally ought to accept that it’s at least a live epistemic
possibility that there is a metaphysically possible world at which concrete
objects pop into existence out of nothing without a cause, then classical
Anselmian theism is defeated.  
  
(11) Therefore, if one rationally ought to reject both IUC and PMC, then
classical Anselmian theism is defeated. [From (9) and (10)]  
  
(12) Therefore, classical Anselmian theism is defeated. [From (5), (8), and
(11)]

## Is God the Best Explanation of Things? A Dialogue is Now Out!

(Rough Draft)  
Consider the following thesis, which I’ll call _Possible Ex Nihilo Creation_
(PEC):

> (PEC) It’s metaphysically possible for concrete objects to be created out of
> nothing.

It’s often taken as axiomatic among theists that PEC is true, on the grounds
that it seems to be a part of scripture and tradition that God created the
universe out of nothing, without the use of prior materials. However, suppose
you are not a theist, and you don’t take PEC as axiomatic. It already comes to
the table with heavy strikes against it: Ordinary experience speaks strongly
against it. And given the long and distinguished pedigree of the principle,
_ex nihilo nihil fit_ , reason seems to speak against it, too. What, then,
could the theist offer to the atheist or agnostic in support of the principle?

Perhaps the theist will here appeal to putative sources of modal evidence to
support PEC, viz., rational intuition, imaginability, or conceivability. Thus,
one might argue that one can conceive of (or intuit, or imagine), say, God
creating the universe out of nothing, and since conceivability is prima facie
evidence of possibility, one is prima facie justified in accepting PEC. Is
this a promising line?

No, it isn’t. There are a lot of points that could be brought up here, but I
want to limit myself to one point based on recent work in modal epistemology,
i.e., the study of how our beliefs about what is impossible, possible, and
necessary are known and/or justified.  
  
There are many objections, both classical and contemporary, that have been
raised against inferences from conceivability to possibility. For example, in
the past, people were able to conceive of the Morning Star existing without
the Evening Star, or water existing without H20. So if everything conceivable
were possible, it should follow that it’s possible for the Morning Star to
exist without the Evening Star, or water without H20. But we now know that
these things are impossible, since the Morning Star _is_ the Evening Star, and
water _is_ H20.  
  
Another example: Goldbach's Conjecture is the mathematical hypothesis that
every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes. To date, no
mathematician has proven that Goldbach's Conjecture is true (nor have they
proven that it's false). Now I can conceive, in some sense, that Goldbach's
Conjecture is false. I can also imagine that it's true. So if all inferences
from conceivability to possibility are valid, then it follows that it's both
possible for Goldbach's Conjecture to be true, and possible for Goldbach's
Conjecture to be false -- in other words it would follow that Goldbach's
Conjecture is only _contingently_ true if true at all. But that can't be
right, for mathematical statements are necessarily true or necessarily false
if true or false at all.  
  
Thus, it looks as though we need some criterion of _legitimate_ conceivings to
screen out illegitimate conceivings, thereby preserving the utility of
inferences from conceivability to possibility. A lot of progress has been made
over the past several decades in the sub-field of modal epistemology, but for
our purposes, it’s enough to mention one key distinction that’s been developed
that’s helpful. Stephen Yablo[1] and James Van Cleve[2] have each pointed out
that there’s a distinction between not conceiving that P is impossible, on the
one hand, and conceiving that P is possible, on the other. Van Cleve calls the
former, ‘weak conceivability’, and the latter, ‘strong conceivability’.  
  
Now it turns out that pretty much all of the counterexamples to the
conceivability-possibility inference are cases in which something is _weakly_
conceivable. For example, when one says that they can conceive of Goldbach’s
Conjecture being true, and that they can conceive of it also being false, they
really mean that they can’t see that either conception is impossible – i.e.,
they only _weakly_ conceive of such things. The same goes for conceiving of
water existing without H20, and conceiving of the Morning Star existing
without the Evening Star. By contrast, I can _strongly_ conceiving of my car
as being red, and of myself as a person who doesn't like to surf (albeit just
barely!); thus such conceivings provide _prima facie_ evidence that it's
_possible_ for my car to be red, and that I really _could_ have been a person
who doesn't enjoy surfing.  
  
In light of this distinction, then, we can handle the counterexamples by
limiting conceivability-possibility inferences to those that involve what is
_strongly_ conceivable – i.e., to those in which one intuits that p is
possible, and not to those in which one merely fails to intuit that p is
impossible.  
  
The weak/strong conceivability gives rise to a dilemma for the case at hand.
For either the relevant type of conceivability or imaginability or rational
intuition is weak conceivability or it is strong conceivability. Suppose the
relevant sort of conceivability is strong conceivability. Is it _strongly_
conceivable that a being can create a concrete object without prior materials
-- i.e., do we "just see" that it _is_ possible? It doesn’t seem so. For the
relevant conceived state of affairs doesn't seem to enjoy the strong epistemic
and doxastic force enjoyed by, say, conceiving of a ball getting stuck on the
roof (I see it there in my mind's eye, wedged behind the chimney). Rather it
merely seems _weakly_ conceivable – i.e. I merely _fail_ to intuit that it's
_im_ possible. It therefore looks as though the truth of PEC isn't prima facie
justified via strong conceivability.  
  
Suppose we're right, then, that it's merely _weakly_ conceivable. Then for the
reasons sketched above, it’s not at all clear that weakly conceiving of
concrete objects being created out of nothing supports PEC. Perhaps the
mainstream view on weak conceivability is wrong, though, and weak
conceivability _is_ good evidence of possibility. Would _that_ help the
theist's cause?  
  
No. For then weak conceivability would end up supporting _other_ things as
well that would _defeat_ theism. So, for example, and most saliently for our
purposes, the weak conceivability of a world that pops into existence without
any cause whatsoever would, likewise, be _prima facie_ evidence of _its_
possibility. But if so, then we're _prima facie_ justified in thinking there
is a metaphysically possible world at which there is a universe that God did
not create. But since classical theism entails that God is the efficient cause
of the universe in all worlds in which both he exists and a universe exists,
we have an argument against the falsity of classical theism, contrary to the
original aim of trying to support PEC on behalf of theism. And of course it
goes without saying that the possibility of the universe popping into
existence without any cause whatsoever would pose worries for the standard
arguments for God's existence.  
  
Therefore, either way, it’s not at all clear that modal evidence supports PEC.

Phenomenological Research_ 53 (1993), 1-42.

Have you considered the scholastic claim that essentially ordered series
cannot be infinite, thus requiring a first element? I wonder if denial of PEC
is tantamount to denial that any series is essentially ordered. If it is, then
giving up essentially ordered series seems like it might be a big sacrifice.

Hi Luke,  
  
I'm not sure I yet see their incompatibility. So, for example, grant the
Thomistic conclusion. Given the presumption against PEC, one would then
conclude that the uncaused cause of the first element produced the series from
prior things or stuff, such as from the substance of the uncaused cause
itself.  
  
Best,  
EA

Is causation _ex nihilo_ any more palatable than matter _ex nihilo_?

Your post here is skeptical about getting matter _ex nihilo_. I'm wondering if
you have the same skepticism against causation _ex nihilo_. If we prohibit
both, and accept the Thomistic conclusion, then that would seem to lead to the
claim that there are no essentially ordered series. Are you comfortable with
that claim?

Sorry, I should've been more specific. I'm trying to get clear on the
difference between creation ex nihilo and causation ex nihilo.  
  
Best,  
EA

Well, your PEC focuses on "concrete objects" coming into existence _ex
nihilo_. Causation seemed to be subordinate to matter[–energy]. But suppose
that you actually mean "concrete objects" _and_ "causation". That would seem
to indicate that either:  
  
(1) there is no causation  
(2) all causal series are infinite  
  
Is there a (3)?

HI Luke,  
  
I'm still not sure I see the problem. Aquinas' famous example of an
essentially ordered series is a stone moved by a stick, which in turn is moved
by a man. Why is this ruled out by the impossibility of the creation of
concrete objects ex nihilo? On a related note, I've argued elsewhere that the
same conclusion goes through for sustaining causes. So, for example, the
continued existence of a flame appears to require a material cause, viz.,
reacting gasses and solids. Remove the latter, and the flame vanishes. This is
true even if the flame is past-eternal.

His main reply is that a belief need not enjoy the doxastic and epistemic
force and vivacity of a Moorean fact if it is to qualify as properly basic at
all. That's of course obviously correct, which is why I'd never assert such a
thing.  
  
  
My rejoinder was already present in the original passage containing my
objection, in the crucial portion of the last sentence that was omitted in
Craig's discussion:

> I think there is a simple yet decisive criticism of Craig's Holy Spirit
> epistemology: at least for the majority of Christians, the Holy Spirit (if
> such there be) fails to present the truth of Christianity in such a way that
> it's anywhere near being on a par with ordinary Moorean facts. In this

> can be warrant-basic -- _at least in the sense that Christian belief enjoys
> sufficient warrant to function as an intrinsic defeater-defeater for strong
> objections to Christian theism_ (emphasis added).

It's worth pausing to reflect on how little it takes for the criticism to go
through. The criticism doesn't implausibly require that all Christians have a
constant experience of the Holy Spirit so intense in epistemic and doxastic
force and vivacity as to be capable of functioning as an intrinsic defeater-
defeater every moment of their waking lives. Rather, the criticism _only_
requires that _at least one_ Christian fails to experience the internal
witness of the Holy Spirit with sufficient force and vivacity so as to
function as an intrinsic defeater-defeater during a time when their warrant
for belief has been defeated for them.[1] I think this is true of probably
most Christians, but it's enough if it's true of at least one of them, which
is _prima facie_ true. But if that's right, the criticism goes through. I
therefore conclude that Craig has failed to dislodge the criticism I raised
against his view.[2]  
  

Hi, EA  
  
Good points, I agree Craig is craigging, and your challenge stands.  
  
A couple of other things I noticed:  
  
In his reply to your argument, Craig says that the witness of the Holy Spirit
is akin to testimony, not akin to a cognitive faculty. He goes on to say the
testimony in question is an external reality, a "testimony to me, just as much
as your testimony is testimony to me".  
But testimony from another person is far too weak to justify (and thus, far
too weak to warrant) belief in claims like "Joe resurrected from the dead", or
"I'm morally perfect" - and it's not even good in the case of the claim "I'm
morally good"; if the claim wasn't justified already, why would a claim like
that justify a belief that the person making the claim is morally good?  
  
Granted, it might be argued that it's only akin to testimony, but not strictly
testimony. But in which way could that be akin to it? (and also, that does not
work well in the context of Craig's claim that it's a testimony to him just as
much as Harris's testimony is a testimony to him).  
  
In fact, despite denying that he associates the testimony with his feelings,
Craig talks about God's "intensifying" the spirit's witness in order to defeat
some defeaters. But what is intensified, if not feelings, sensations, etc.?
And how could intensified feelings justify beliefs like the ones mentioned
above?  
A testimony is not the kind of thing that can be intensified.  

Hi Angra,  
  
[This]() source provides the clearest account I've been able to track down on
what Craig thinks the inner testimony of the Holy Spirit consists in. Here's
the key passage from it on the issue:  
  
"The best way I can describe this would be to say that it is indeed a kind of
elevating feeling of blessed assurance, but not only when you contemplate
particularly moving passages of Scripture or hear an uplifting sermon. Rather,
it is a deep seated kind of assurance of salvation that one carries with one
that one is rightly related to God, that one is saved. The New Testament says
that when we cry out to God “Father!” that God's spirit bears witness with our
spirit that we are indeed children of God and thereby reconciled to him. In
popular Christian piety, this goes under the name assurance of salvation.
There is just this deep-seated assurance that one is saved. That is the best I
can do to try to describe what this testimony of the Holy Spirit is like."  
  
I worry about the epistemic merits of such an experience, as it seems easy to
account for it without appeal to anything supernatural: if one accepts the
logic of the evangelical account of salvation by grace through faith, and that
all this requires is acceptance of the atoning sacrifice of Jesus by praying
"the sinner's prayer", then it's a simple matter of following the reasoning of
a modus ponens inference to generate such assurance (1. If I've "prayed the
prayer" of accepting Jesus' atoning sacrifice, then I've been eternally saved;
2. I've "prayed the prayer" of accepting Jesus' atoning sacrifice; 3.
Therefore, I've been eternally saved.). And of course, it wouldn't be
surprising that reflection on such an inference would be endorphin-releasing,
bring psychological comfort and peace, whether or not the Holy Spirit exists
and can "witness" to these things in the "heart" of the believer. Such a
psychological experience can be especially powerful if it was preceded by a
preacher or evangelist who tells you you're damned for your sins, and there's
nothing you can do to save yourself. If you "pray the prayer", as I did when I
became a Christian, it caused a psychologically overwhelming experience, with
continuing emotional aftershocks, even years later, whenever I reflected on
that day. So it seems to me that since this latter, non-supernatural
explanation of "the inner testimony of the Holy Spirit" is an epistemic
possibility the believer can't rule out with their evidence, the epistemic
force of any such experience is undercut.  
  
Best,  
EA

Hi EA,  
  
Thanks for the reference.  
  
Phenomenologically, what Craig describes does not seem at all like testimony,
but in fact like a person would feel if the correct explanation is roughly the
hypothesis you describe or - if a an entity with superhuman powers were
involved, which of course I reject - if the correct explanation were that some
powersful entity is altering his normal thought processes (barring a dedicated
cognitive faculty, at least). It's a bit puzzling that he calls that
"testimony".  
  
That aside, and with regard to the epistemic merits, I agree with your
assessment that the Christian is not justified in ruling out the alternative
you suggest.  
  
In addition, specifically I'm inclined to press the point that it doesn't work
at all in justifying some key Christian moral beliefs - including beliefs
about the moral character of the being allegedly involved in the experience.  
For example, let's say that the believer also holds that the being in question
is the author of Old Testament Laws and/or that most if not all non-Christians
will suffer eternal torment in Hell, as punishment for rejecting him [or for
some other reason, in case the believer holds the reason is something else]  
Then, even if the experience were to provide some grounds for believing that
there is a superhuman being who loves one, and who will refrain from
inflicting infinite punishment on one, that would provide no good reason to
suspect that the being question is morally perfect, or even morally good.  
In particular, the belief that one is loved by that being, even if justified,
would not provide justification for the belief that the people stoned or
burned to death, etc., according to OT law, actually deserved it, let alone to
for the belief that the person who loves one is behaving in a just manner when
he inflicts eternal suffering on other people for not believing in his
existence, or for believing in the wrong religion, or for rejecting him, etc.

## Is God the Best Explanation of Things? A Dialogue is Now Out!

The paper aims to make trouble for naturalists, arguing that, given the facts
of evolution, they should abandon moral realism, accept a rationalism in
tension with naturalism, or give up naturalism. In this way, it brings out an
apparent epistemological tension between atheism and moral realism.

Hi, EA,  
  
A couple of cents:  
  
1\. Bogardus's claim about the percentage of anti-realists doesn't take into
consideration that different philosophers construe the expression "moral
realism" very differently. For example, Geoff Sayre-McCord's definition in the
SEP's entry on moral realism is compatible with the view that, say, if
species#2 evolved very differently (e.g., from something like orcas) in the
way proposed in Bogardo's argument, and as a result they had beliefs very
different from our moral beliefs, they wouldn't have moral beliefs and moral
language at all, but #2-moral beliefs and language, and the fact that their
#2-moral beliefs would not be a close match for our moral beliefs would not
pose a threat to our moral knowledge.  
  
Bogardus - and most or all defenders of evolutionary debunking arguments -
seems to implicitly reject that a view of that sort would be a form of moral
realism. But if he doesn't count that sort of view (and some others) as
realism, he seems to have no good info on the percentage of moral realists
among philosophers.  
  
2\. More importantly, his claim that an evolved human faculty for evaluating
the world in moral terms presupposes moral realism is false if a view like the
one I sketched in 1. above is not classified as realism, since we may well
have a human faculty for evaluating the world in moral terms, while #2-orcas
have a faculty to evaluate the world in #2-moral terms, and so on.  
  
3\. One can make a parallel color-symmetry debunking argument:  
  
(13') Our color faculty was naturally selected to produce adaptive color
beliefs, and not naturally selected to produce true color beliefs.  
(14') Therefore, it is not true that: had our species evolved elsewhere,
elsewhen and we later formed color beliefs using the same method we actually  
used, our beliefs would be true.  
(15') It is not clear whether we are in a better epistemic position than our
many nearby counterfactual selves who disagree with us on color matters.  
(16') Therefore, our color beliefs do not count as knowledge.  
  
Actually, more evidence can be given against the particular sort of color
realism that parallels what Bogardus seems to demand of moral realism,
considering that we already know that many other animals widely "disagree"
with us on color matters (I don't think that's disagreement at all, but that's
what the Bogardus seems to imply in the moral case, and I'm making a parallel
in the color case).  
  
Now, there is no equivalent of what Bogardus calls "Rationalism" in the case
of color - e.g., it's apparent to all that reason won't tell us what color an
apple is.  
So, it seems to me that Bogardus's argumentation, translated to the color
case, would lead to the conclusion that either there is Divine Color
Revelation (and so, it seems bees and eagles unfortunately have false color
beliefs, but we're not in trouble because God revealed to us the true colors
of the world), or else color realism is false, and apparently, that entails
our color beliefs do not count as knowledge. As I see it, that's a problem for
Bogardus's argumentation, not for color knowledge (and Divine Color Revelation
is false).  

Maybe I'm just way too under-informed, but I really don't see how one's nearby
counterfactual selves will have different moral principles given a different
set of evolutionary history. A moral realist will certainly disagree. Seems to
me, the argument merely presupposes this or at least supports it inadequately.

## Is God the Best Explanation of Things? A Dialogue is Now Out!

Robin Collins will offer a new argument based on the fine-tuning of the
cosmos. He will argue that the universe has been finely tuned to optimize the
discoverability of physical laws and entities, which neither random chance,
nor the multiverse can explain. Paul Draper will construct a pro tanto case
against orthodox theism based on its immodesty and on its poor fit with a
variety of known facts about pleasure and pain, love and hate, autonomy and
heteronomy, achievement and failure, and virtue and vice. Collins and Draper
will each respond to the other’s presentations.

The theme should be interpreted broadly. It includes not only arguments for or
against the existence of God, but a variety of other issues including, for
example, questions about the nature of existence as it relates to God and the
epistemology of theism.

###  Another Worry for The Value of Freedom in Free Will Theodicies

A similar worry arises for love between God and human beings. For if God is
morally perfect and perfectly loving _essentially_ , then even if _we_ have
significant freedom with respect to choosing to love _God_ , God does not have
significant freedom with respect to choosing to love _us_. But if that's
right, then there is a significant sense in which the kind of love God can
offer us is inferior to the kind of love we can offer him.

  
In short, there's a _prima facie_ case to be made that a Hickian account of
the value of freedom fares no better than the Plantingian account.

## Is God the Best Explanation of Things? A Dialogue is Now Out!

Skeptical theism is a leading response to the evidential argument from evil
against the existence of God. Skeptical theists attempt to block the inference
from the existence of inscrutable evils to gratuitous evils by insisting that
given our cognitive limitations, it wouldn’t be surprising if there were God-
justifying reasons we can’t think of. A well-known objection to skeptical
theism is that it opens up a skeptical Pandora’s box, generating implausibly
wide-ranging forms of skepticism, including skepticism about the external
world and past. This paper looks at several responses to this Pandora’s box
objection, including a popular response devised by Beaudoin and Bergmann. I
find that all of the examined responses fail. It appears the Pandora’s box
objection to skeptical theism still stands.

The paper argues first that, by not rescuing innocents in certain ways , God
violates a weak Bad Samaritan principle that few would deny. This ‘Bad
Samaritan argument’ appears to block the traditional free will defense to the
problem of evil, since respecting the principle does not violate or show lack
of respect for free will. Second, the paper articulates a version of the
traditional argument from evil, the ‘Aftertaste argument’, that appears to
close some of the traditional loopholes in the argument from evil, such as the
‘greater good from evil’ defense.

UPDATE: Many thanks!

In addition, I'm not sure how this defense ties up with broader worries about
the connection between alternative possibilities, God's freedom, and God's
value. Presumably, God never goes wrong with respect to any action - but does
this threaten his freedom or does it not? If it does threaten this freedom,
then what is supposed to be the value of God creating free agents, when the
being of ultimate metaphysical value himself lacks it? If on the other hand
that it does not threaten it (one might try to motivate this with broadly
source incompatibilist concerns which typically deny the Principle of
Alternative Possibilities), then there's nothing incompatible with freedom and
God necessarily creating saintly agents. Pruss has a paper on this issue, but
I didn't find it too convincing.

## Is God the Best Explanation of Things? A Dialogue is Now Out!

Two familiar worldviews dominate Western philosophy: materialist atheism and
the benevolent God of the Abrahamic faiths. Tim Mulgan explores a third way.
Ananthropocentric Purposivism claims that there is a cosmic purpose, but human
beings are irrelevant to it. Purpose in the Universe develops a philosophical
case for Ananthropocentric Purposivism that it is at least as strong as the
case for either theism or atheism. The book borrows traditional theist
arguments to defend a cosmic purpose. These include cosmological,
teleological, ontological, meta-ethical, and mystical arguments. It then
borrows traditional atheist arguments to reject a human-centred purpose. These
include arguments based on evil, diversity, and the scale of the universe.
Mulgan also highlights connections between morality and metaphysics, arguing
that evaluative premises play a crucial and underappreciated role in
metaphysical debates about the existence of God, and Ananthropocentric
Purposivism mutually supports an austere consequentialist morality based on
objective values. He concludes that, by drawing on a range of secular and
religious ethical traditions, a non-human-centred cosmic purpose can ground a
distinctive human morality. Our moral practices, our view of the moral
universe, and our moral theory are all transformed if we shift from the
familiar choice between a universe without meaning and a universe where humans
matter to the less self-aggrandising thought that, while it is about
something, the universe is not about us.

Although of course I'll have to read it first, I suspect that a case for this
sort of view will raise a powerful challenge to classical theism.

Update: Thanks!

Interesting article, but I remain unconvinced.  
  
  
A few initial comments: Crow characterizes Plantinga's argument as an argument
against atheism, when my understanding is that it is an argument against
evolutionary _naturalism._ I take it that naturalism is non-trivially distinct
from atheism. Now, it may well be the case that many atheists presently are
some stripe of metaphysical and/or metaphilosophical naturalists, but surely
that doesn't at all speak to atheism _entailing_ the truth of naturalism? (I
say this as an atheist who is skeptical of contemporary naturalism)  
  
Likewise, it is not a suppressed premise of Street's argument that atheism is
true. In her discussion of the 'adaptive link' account, Street considers the
view that _true_ moral judgments are advantageous and puts pressure on it as a
failing hypothesis compared to her adaptive link account. The suppressed
premise in there seems to be that there wasn't anything working above the
level of evolutionary forces as would be consistent with naturalism. But, why
characterize that as a suppressed premise of _atheism?_ Note for example that
it would also be consistent with Street's analysis of the adaptive link
account that some type of Creator exists, but that He is utterly indifferent
to the existence of human creatures. Or, from the other direction, it would
also be inconsistent with Street's suppressed premise if one accepted Nagel's
atheistic teleological view for why certain moral attitudes come to fixation.
Hence, it is simply not true that Street's argument contains atheism as a
suppressed premise.  
  
(On the flipside, I found it odd that Crow presented theism vs metphysical
antirealism as opposing pairs. Presumably theism is not intrinsically opposed
to metaphysical antirealism - one need only look to Berkeley, Kant, Dummett or
others. Plantinga himself had presented an argument that metaphysical
antirealists should be theists!)  
  
In any case, I suspect Street will likely reject A1 of Crow's reconstructed
argument. However, Crow tries to argue that this results in a sort of
implausible epistemic elitism, in that suspension of judgment regarding the
Probability Thesis by philosophical novices with respect to the EAAN will
resulted in an undefeated diminished defeater for all of that novice's
beliefs.  
  
However, this suggestion of an implausible epistemic elitism seems itself
implausible. Consider Street's recent argument that theism leads to normative
skepticism. Conjoin Bruce Russell's argument that skeptical theism leads to
global skepticism and you have the ingredients of an argument that theism
leads to global skepticism - presumably, one that will end up undermining R. I
take it that novice theists should suspend judgment of the success or failure
of such an argument - but, per Crow's other half of the pickle, it follows
then that such theists - of which I would take to be a wide, diverse variety -
should then be subject to a similar self-diminishing situation.  
  
It doesn't seem that Crow's argument from diminished defeaters is at all
unique to Plantinga's - it can generalize to any sort of argument that could
potentially undermine R. Take Peter Unger's defense of skepticism. Novices
should suspend judgment of the success or failure of his arguments - from
which it would follow then that they are in a state of self-diminishment.  
  
So, if Crow's reasoning is sound, then it seems novices, theist, atheist, or
what have you, are going to be subject to self-diminishing scenario the moment
they even think about the relevant arguments. So, why is Street's epistemic
'elitism' going to be any worse in this regard than elitism concerning
skeptical arguments in general?

The preceding argument doesn’t address exactly why Crow’s argument seems off-
base, so it may be more helpful to think about diminished defeat in general.  
  
To say more about Crow's use of diminished defeaters, one may have what one
takes to be excellent reasons for X, but on Crow's understanding of things, it
apparently seems that suspension of judgment with regards to arguments
purporting that ~X should automatically result in a diminished defeater. By
Crow's understanding, such individuals are then subject to a diminished
defeater for their belief.  
  
But, just how does Crow understand "diminished defeaters" to work here? In the
case of a rebutting defeater, presumably if one judges that one has a
rebutting defeater for X, then one should relinquish belief in X and adopt ~X.
In the case of a "diminished defeater," presumably that isn't the case. What
then are the doxastic consequences that should follow from possession of so-
called diminished defeaters?  
  
Surely, they cannot be as strong as suspension of judgment of the belief which
possesses the diminished defeater. Let's suppose that we believe that X and
suppose there exists some argument Y that argues that ~X. I don't see why our
suspension in judgment in Y should automatically lead us to suspend judgment
in X - don't we instead persist in our belief that X while acknowledging that
it isn't fully secure from attack? For instance, one's belief in theism may
not be fully secure if one hasn't followed the ins and outs of the problem of
evil or the Street - Russell argument I suggested above. But suppose as a
consequence of this that I _should_ suspend my judgment in the belief that
theism is true?  
  
On this scheme, the mere existence of arguments to the contrary of which I
presently suspend judgment should lead me to suspend judgment. However, there
exist a myriad of arguments against any particular belief one has, many of
which one should suspend judgment with respect to. The consequence would be to
commit novices and perhaps even experts to a near-Pyrrhonian agnosticism,
which is surely an implausible consequence, if we're comparing
implausibilities.  
  
On the other hand, perhaps Crow allows us to persist in our belief that X,
despite X being subject to a diminished defeater. The most a diminished
defeater might do in those circumstances is temper our confidence in X,
similar to how disagreement amongst experts in philosophy might temper our
philosophical convictions, but should in itself lead us to abandon them. But,
if the most in terms of doxastic consequences that diminished defeat has is a
tempering of our convictions, then what is supposed to be implausible about
the epistemic 'elitism' on the second horn of the pickle? Surely, it wouldn't
be that implausible to suggest that philosophical novices temper their
convictions on a given philosophical issue given suspension of judgment on
particular, often arcane arguments for and against any particular belief?  
  
Consequently, I believe that the second horn of Crow's dilemma holds little to
no bite against Street.

## Is God the Best Explanation of Things? A Dialogue is Now Out!

...is a collection of papers (including one new one) that reflect the mature
thought of someone who has been working in philosophy of religion for nearly
half a century. Here's the blurb:

> Suppose that God exists: what difference would that make to the world? The
> answer depends on the nature of God and the nature of the world. In this
> book, William E. Mann argues in one new and sixteen previously published
> essays for a modern interpretation of a traditional conception of God as a
> simple, necessarily existing, personal being. Divine simplicity entails that
> God has no physical composition or temporal stages; that there is in God no
> distinction between essence and existence; that there is no partitioning of
> God's mental life into beliefs, desires, and intentions. God is thus a
> spiritual, eternal being, dependent on nothing else, whose essence is to
> exist and whose mode of existence is identical with omniscience,
> omnipotence, and perfectly goodness.

> In metaphysical contrast, the world is a spatial matrix populated most
> conspicuously by finite physical objects whose careers proceed sequentially
> from past to present to future. Mann defends a view according to which the
> world was created out of nothing and is sustained in existence from moment
> to moment by God. The differences in metaphysical status between creator and
> creatures raise questions for which Mann suggests answers. How can God know
> contingent facts and necessary truths without depending on them? Why is it
> so easy to overlook God's presence? Why would self-sufficient God create
> anything? Wouldn't a perfect God create the best world possible? Can God be
> free? Can we be free if God's power is continuously necessary to sustain us
> in existence? If God does sustain us, is God an accomplice whenever we sin?

> Mann responds to the Euthyphro dilemma by arguing for a kind of divine
> command metaethical theory, whose normative content lays emphasis on love.
> Given the metaphysical differences between us, how can there be loving
> relationships between God and creatures? Mann responds by examining the
> notions of piety and hope.

###  Betenson's New Critique of Craig's Arguments Against Atheistic Meaning

> William Lane Craig argues that both God and immortality are required for
> life to have meaning; life is futile without either of the two. I argue that
> combining William Lane Craig’s arguments for the futility of life without
> God or immortality, together with a plausible amendment to his working
> definition of ‘futility’, entails the counterintuitive conclusion that life
> is futile if God does exist. Craig says that God must exist as a guarantor
> of ultimate justice, and that this ultimate ‘fairness’ is necessary for life
> to have meaning. I will argue that this ultimate ‘fairness’ entails that our
> lives are futile, since, given the existence of God, our actions are
> causally irrelevant to the achievement of the satisfaction of the ‘Good’.
> This discussion serves to pinpoint a major flaw in Craig’s reasoning: the
> claim that events of merely ‘relative’ significance do not have the
> potential to counter the futility of life.

###  Hanna's New Paper on Philosophical Success, Failure, and the Problem of
Evil

> Peter van Inwagen proposes a criterion of philosophical success. He takes it
> to support an extremely pessimistic view about philosophy. He thinks that
> all philosophical arguments for substantive conclusions fail, including the
> argument from evil. I’m more optimistic on both counts. I’ll identify
> problems with van Inwagen’s criterion and propose an alternative. I’ll then
> explore the differing implications of our criteria. On my view,
> philosophical arguments can succeed and the argument from evil isn’t
> obviously a failure.

###  John Russell Roberts' Nice New Paper on Why There is Something Rather
Than Nothing

> _This essay offers a defense of Axiarchism’s answer to the question, “Why
> does the world exist?” against prominent objections leveled against it by
> Derek Parfit. Parfit rejects the Axiarchist answer while abstracting from it
> his own Selector strategy. I argue that the abstraction fails, and that even
> if we were to regard Axiarchism as an instance of a Selector hypothesis, we
> should regard it as the only viable one. I also argue that Parfit’s
> abstraction leads him to mistake the nature and, thereby, the force of
> Axiarchism’s claim to being an ultimate explanation. Finally, I defend the
> Axiarchist’s claim that the good could not fail to rule._
