Pascal famously argued that practical reasoning should lead people to try to
form within themselves a commitment to religious practice and obedience, based
upon a belief in God. I propose to take a less ambitious argument, which I
call the Sensible Argument, and use it to present The Puzzle. I argue that
there is a huge puzzle here, about the radical dissonance between the beliefs
and practices of many of the purportedly religious. There are, I will argue,
good reasons to doubt, concerning many (clearly not all or indeed most)
purported religious believers, whether they are indeed believers, or at least
whether their beliefs are strong; and religion seems to greatly increase the
risks of deception, duplicity, and hypocrisy, as well as self-deception and
inauthenticity. By turning towards a religious form of life, one will
therefore be adding great morality-related risks. Arguably, if there is a God
who deeply cares about individual moral behaviour, he would punish religious
moral transgressors more than the secular ones. One is unlikely to be saved
from hell (or other severe divine punishment) by becoming religious. If one is
going to wager, it seems much more sensible to wager on the secular side.

The fact that orthodox theists, from at least Augustine and all the way to the
present, have seen logic as the expression of single, rational, divine Mind is
at least some evidence that theism expects and predicts logical monism. But
[the case](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10992-008-9082-6)
[against logical monism](https://www.st-
andrews.ac.uk/~ac117/papers/LogicalNihilism.pdf) \-- and for the disjunction
of logical pluralism and logical nihilism -- is more plausible than the case
for logical monism. But the truth of the disjunction of logical pluralism and
logical nihilism is prima facie more surprising on theism than on naturalism.
Therefore, the case for the disjunction of logical pluralism and logical
nihilism provides at least some evidence against theism.

Recent empirical work on [motivated
reasoning](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phc3.12828)
indicates that it is strongly resistant to detection, even despite our best
efforts (Ballantyne 2015; Pronin et al. 2002). Perhaps worse, other work shows
that attempts to preempt motivated reasoning reinforce its impact (Ehrlinger
et al. 2005; Schwitzgebel & Ellis 2017). This is surprising on theism, given
that it's surprising that God would design our cognitive faculties in a way
that's highly disposed to unreliability -- and likely without remedy --
especially in ways that can be morally pernicious. By contrast, it's not
surprising on naturalism, since nature is "indifferent" to our welfare on that
hypothesis, and since motivated reasoning is conducive to survival and
reproduction (Mercier & Sperber 2011). Therefore, the existence of motivated
reasoning is at least some evidence for naturalism vis-a-vis theism.

Here's a new paper making [a

metaphysical.html) [I've been on about
recently](https://exapologist.blogspot.com/2022/04/camerons-forthcoming-
book.html): recent work on metaphysical infinitism and coherentism undercuts
certain cosmological arguments, and the metaphysical foundationalism
presupposed by theism.

Upshot: Cogent modal ontological arguments (at least ones friendly to
classical theism) seem to have no suitable home in the metaphysics and
epistemology of modality.

It's not clear that there's a metaphysics and epistemology of modality that
can vindicate a cogent modal ontological argument for classical theism.
Theistic activism and theistic conceptualism with respect to possible worlds
are a bad fit with the modal ontological argument (circularity). But so is
Platonism about possible worlds (runs afoul of the aseity-sovereignty
doctrine). Perhaps a dispositionalist/powers-based account of modality is
compatible with the modal ontological argument, but prima facie,
dispositionalism entails moderate modal skepticism (cf.
[Jacobs](https://philpapers.org/rec/JACAPT-2),
[Vetter](https://philpapers.org/rec/VETPPA)), thereby undermining the
possibility premise in the modal ontological argument. What's left? Modal
fictionalism? That's already been shown to imply [devastating
problems](https://exapologist.blogspot.com/2016/09/new-paper-on-modal-
fictionalism-and.html) for the modal ontological argument.

My second worry is the one I want to briefly focus on in this post. The worry
is that it fails to get at what is potentially a deeper distinction, and one
that's potentially more illuminating than the distinction between physicalism
and supernaturalism. The distinction I have in mind is at the level of _basic
ontological categories_ and _categorical priority_ \-- in particular, the
level of the ontological priority of the categories of _substance_ and
_property_. According to a standard and historically prominent view,
substances are more fundamental than properties (or at least: substances are
no less fundamental than properties). Accordingly, let's call this sort of
view _a substance-first ontology_.

Which view is correct: the substance-first view or the property-first view?
This question has potentially huge implications for the disagreement between
theists and non-theists.[1] This is because, prima facie, _orthodox monotheism
entails the substance-first view._ And this in turn is because, prima facie,
_God_ is a substance, and is prior to all else that exists. Therefore, if
there are reasons to prefer the property-first view, then there are thereby
reasons to prefer non-theism to theism.

[1] There are other views that are equally powerful threats to theism, such as
a stuff-first view, according to which stuffs are more fundamental than
substances. Another is Jason Turner's facts-first ontology (as well as related
events-first ontologies). However, I leave these sort of threats to the side
for the present post.

I have at least two worries for this way of carving things up. I've gestured
to the first of these on
[previous](https://exapologist.blogspot.com/2022/04/camerons-forthcoming-
book.html) [occasions](https://exapologist.blogspot.com/2022/06/the-argument-
from-metaphysical.html) \-- viz., that the characterization of the distinction
presupposes metaphysical foundationalism, and yet metaphysical foundationalism
has recently been called into doubt (on both philosophical and scientific
grounds), and metaphysical coherentism and metaphysical infinitism have both
recently been vigorously defended.

By contrast, a number of philosophers (e.g.,
[Laurie](https://exapologist.blogspot.com/2022/08/the-argument-from-one-
category-ontology.html)
[Paul](https://exapologist.blogspot.com/2022/08/a-sketch-of-how-to-explain-
everything.html) and [Shamik
Dasgupta](https://shamik.net/papers/dasgupta%20individuals.pdf)) have recently
argued that properties are more fundamental than substances, and indeed that
substances may not even exist. Let's call this sort of view _a property-first
ontology_.

The evidence for fine-tuning confirms both demiurgism and panentheism over
theism, and in this way is good evidence against theism. This is because the
intuitive and empirical evidence against creation _ex nihilo_ creates a strong
drag on theismâ€™s prior probability not suffered by demiurgism and panentheism,
and so they lap the former in terms of posterior probability. _A fortiori_ ,
the posterior probability of the inclusive disjunction of demiurgism and
panentheism is considerably higher than that of theism given the evidence of
fine-tuning.

...is the paper title of Blake Hereth's [provocative new
paper](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/religious-

_Religious Studies_. Here's the abstract:
