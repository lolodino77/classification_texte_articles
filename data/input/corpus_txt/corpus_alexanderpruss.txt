And now for something not very philosophical. Today, in front of two witnesses
and two timekeepers and with the help of Levi Durham doing an amazing feat of
belaying me for an hour, I beat the [Guinness World
Record](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/438677-greatest-
vertical-distance-climbed-on-an-artificial-climbing-wall-in-1-hour-indi) in
greatest vertical distance climbed in one hour on an indoor climbing wall. The
previous record was 928.5m and I did 1013.7m (with about half a minute to
spare). On Baylor's climbing wall, this involved 67 climbs divided into sets
of 10 (the last was 7), with about a minute of rest between sets (the clock
kept on running during the rest).

In the morning I stress-baked pumpkin muffins for myself and the volunteers. I
had the muffins, water and loose chalk on a table for use during breaks.

Since Guinness requires video proof in addition to human witnesses, in the
interests of redundancy, I had three cameras pointed at the attempt. The best
footage (above) is from a Sony A7R2 with a zoom lens at 16mm, producing 1080P
at 59.94 fps. Video was processed with Adobe Premiere Rush. The processing
consisted of trimming the start and end, and adding a timing video track I
generated with a [Python OpenCV2
script](https://gist.github.com/arpruss/3a705c859d4ea4a482c4e47e96a08f79),
synchronized with single-frame precision at the 1:00:00 point with the footage
of Giant Stopwatch (barely visible under the table towards the end of the
video; early in the video, glare hides it). For the unofficial version I link
above, I accelerated the middle climbs 10X in Premiere Rush.

About half-way through, I ducked into the storage area inside the rock and
changed to a dry shirt.

A Kindle Fire running a pre-release version of my [Giant
Stopwatch](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=omegacentauri.mobi.simplestopwatch&hl=en_US&gl=US)
app provided unofficial timing for audience to see and for my pacing. I had to
modify the app to have a periodic beep to meet Guinness's requirements of an
audible stop signal.

On the ground there was a sheet of paper with the start and end times of each
break printed in large letters (calculated by [this
script](https://gist.github.com/arpruss/10e364904dfcc19b043a594232e0acde)), as
well as the mid-point time for each set of 10 to keep me better on pace.

I climbed in sets of 10. The planned pace was 8:18 per set and a 44-45 second
rest between sets (clock runs during rests,), averaging at 49.8 seconds per
climb including descent. I was always ahead of pace, and I occasionally took a
mini break at the mid-point time if I was too far ahead.

Most of my practice was with an auto-belay, and at a shorter distance per
climb (and hence greater number of climbs needed) since the auto-belay makes
it impossible to get to the top of the wall. The auto-belay is also spring
loaded so it effectively decreases body weight (by 7 lbs at the bottom
according to my measurement). Then a couple of weeks ago the auto-belay was
closed by management due to a maintenance issue, and I had a break in training
until the Wednesday before the official attempt when I trained with a manual
belay.

I wore moderately worn (one small hole) and comfortable 5.10 Anasazi shoes, a
Camp USA Energy harness, shorts and a T-shirt. (I have not received any
sponsorship.) My belayer used a tube-style device and wore belay gloves.

I trained for about three months, not very heavily. In training did two
unofficial full-length practice runs, and in each I beat the previous record:
in the first one I got 947.1 meters and in the second I got 1004.5, so I was
pretty confident I could beat the 928.5 meters on the official attempt (though
I was still pretty nervous). I also trained by doing a small number of
approximately 1/2 or 1/3 sized practices (maybe three or so), and more regular
shorter runs (1-10 climbs) at fast pace.

The route was a standard 5.7 grade for most of my training (including when I
unofficially beat the records), with Rock management kindly agreeing to keep
the route up for several months for me. For the final attempt, we added holds
to make the finish at the top of the wall, and changed three other holds to
easier ones. (Guinness has no route grade requirements.)

You should make a living out of that, Alex.  
Would give you a lot less stress.

The top of the wall is 15.13 meters vertically from the ground (as measured by
a geology grad student), at 3.5 degree slab.

I was actually really stressed yesterday. I had already beaten the record
unofficially in practice, but with lots of people coming to watch (local
climbers, grad students and colleagues), I didn't want to disappoint.
Contributing to the stress was that the conditions changed from my practice
runs (the auto-belay was down from maintenance and I had to use a manual
belay; this involved lengthening the route slightly, increasing the length of
each set and decreasing the total count, as well as an effective increase in
my weight since the auto-belay subtracts a few pounds due to its spring-
loading), and that I hadn't been able to train on the particular route for
several weeks prior to Wednesday due to the auto-belay being down for
maintenance while on Wednesday's approximately half-distance-at-half-time
practice I was more tired at the end than I should have been due to poor
pacing.

Second, “lethal” weapons can be used less than lethally. For instance, with
modern medicine, abdominal gunshot wounds are only 10% fatal, yet they are no
doubt very effective at stopping an attacker. While it may seem weird to
imagine a pacifist shooting someone in the stomach, when the chance of
survival is 90%, it does not seem unreasonable to say that the pacifist could
be aiming to stop the attacker non-lethally. After all, tasers sometimes kill,
too. They do so less than 0.25% of the time, but that’s a difference of degree
rather than of principle.

First, we have “officially” non-lethal weapons: tasers, gas, etc. Some of
these might violate current international law, but it seems that a pacifist
country could modify its commitment to some accords.

I’ve been wondering whether it is possible for a country to count as pacifist
and yet wage a defensive war. I think the answer is positive, as long as one
has a moderate pacifism that is opposed to lethal violence but not to all
violence. I think that a prohibition of all violence is untenable. It seems
obvious that if you see someone about to shoot an innocent person, and you can
give the shooter a shove to make them miss, you presumptively should.

Whether such a limited way of waging war could be successful probably depends
on the case. If one combined the non-lethal (or not intentionally lethal)
means with technological and numerical superiority, it wouldn’t be surprising
to me if one could win.

Third, we might subdivide moderate pacifists based on whether they prohibit
all violence that foreseeably leads to death or just violence that
intentionally leads to death. If it is only intentionally lethal violence that
is forbidden, then quite a bit of modern warfare can stand. If the enemy is
attacking with tanks or planes, one can intentionally destroy the tank or
plane as a weapon, while only foreseeing, without intending, the death of the
crew. (I don’t know how far one can take this line without sophistry. Can one
drop a bomb on an infantry unit intending to smash up their rifles without
intending to kill the soldiers?) Similarly, one can bomb enemy weapons
factories.

These may seem to be consequentialist arguments. I don't think so. I don't
have the same intuitions if we replace the general by the general's innocent
child in (2) and (4), even if killing the child were to stop the war (e.g., by
making the general afraid that their other children would be murdered).

So maybe our choice is between tasing a million, thereby non-intentionally
killing 250 soldiers, and intentionally killing one general. It seems to me
that (2) is morally preferable, even though our moderate pacifist has to allow
(1) and forbid (2).

Very well. Now consider this on a national level. Suppose there are a million
enemy soldiers ordered to commit genocide against ten million, and you have
two ways to stop them:

Imagine a moderate pacifist who rejects lethal self-defense, but allows non-
lethal self-defense when appropriate, say by use of tasers.

Note that a version of this argument goes through even if the moderate
pacifist backs up and says that tasers are too lethal. For suppose instead of
tasers we have drones that destroy the dominant hand of an enemy soldier while
guaranteeing survival (with science fictional medical technology). It’s
clearly right to release such a drone on a soldier who is about to kill ten
innocents. But now compare:

I think (4) is still morally preferable to causing the kind of disruption to
the lives of a million people that plan (3) would involve.

If you can tase one person to stop the murder of ten, then (1) should be
permissible if it’s the only option. But tasers occasionally kill people. We
don’t know how often. Apparently it’s [less than 1 in
400](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2021/04/23/police-
use-tasers-ends-hundreds-deaths-like-daunte-wright/7221153002/) uses. Suppose
it’s 1 in 4000. Then option (1) results in 250 enemy deaths.

Of course one should never murder anyone, but the question is: would killing
Putin be murder?

Now, imagine that one person is attacking you and nine other innocents, with
the intent of killing the ten of you, and you can stop them with a taser.
Surely you should, and surely the moderate pacifist will say that this is an
appropriate use case for the taser.

Alex  
  
Doesn't you post here entail that we should murder Putin?

One should never murder anyone. Killing, on the other hand, can sometimes be
justified.  
  
One question about killing the leader of an invading country is whether the
leader counts as a civilian, since the killing of civilians is forbidden by
the Geneva Convention. There is also some worry about the Geneva Convention's
killing by "perfidy", which is taken to rule out at least some assassinations.
So, as a matter of positive international law, it seems a difficult question.  
  
Were there no international law on the matter, I wouldn't see a significant
difference between killing a political leader and killing a general, if both
are giving orders to fight. Morally speaking, but not necessarily in
international law, both seem to me to be equally combatants.  
  
Besides the moral and legal questions, there is also a prudential question. In
my post I assumed that killing the general would stop the invasion. I got to
assume that because I was making up the case. Whether in actual fact killing a
leader would stop an invasion is less clear. Indeed such a thing might be seen
as such a serious attack on the country that the retaliation might be really
horrific.
