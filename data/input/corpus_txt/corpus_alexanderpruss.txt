What about the other direction? Can we reduce goods to reasons?

The simplest story would be that goods reduce to reasons to promote them.

But there seem to be goods that give no one a reason to promote them. Consider
the good fact that there exist (in the eternalist sense: existed, exist now,
will exist, or exist timelessly) agents. No agent can promote the fact that
there exist agents: that good fact is part of the agent’s thrownness, to put
it in Heideggerese.

Maybe, though, this isn’t quite right. If Alice is an agent, then Alice’s
existence is a good, but the fact that some agent or other exists isn’t a good
as such. I’m not sure. It seems like a world with agents is better for the
existence of agency, and not just better for the particular agents it has.
Adding _another_ agent to the world seems a lesser value contribution than
just ensuring that there is agency at all. But I could be wrong about that.

Another family of goods, though, are necessary goods. That God exists is good,
but it is necessarily true. That various mathematical theorems are beautiful
is necessarily true. Yet no one has reason to promote a necessary truth.

But perhaps we could have a subtler story on which goods reduce not just to
reasons to promote them, but to reasons to “stand for them” (taken as the
opposite of “standing against them”), where promotion is one way of “standing
for” a good, but there are others, such as celebration. It does not make sense
to promote the existence of God, the existence of agents, or the Pythagorean
theorem, but celebrating these goods makes sense.

However, while it might be the case that something is good just in case an
agent should “stand for it”, it does not seem right to think that it is good
_to the extent that_ an agent should “stand for it”. For the degree to which
an agent should stand for a good is determined not just by the magnitude of
the good, but the agent’s relationship to the good. I should celebrate my
children’s accomplishments more than strangers’.

Perhaps, though, we can modify the story in terms of goods-for- _x_ , and say
that _G_ is good-for- _x_ to the extent that _x_ should stand for _G_. But
that doesn’t seem right, either. I should stand for justice for all, and not
merely to the degree that justice-for-all is good-for-me. Moreover, there
goods that are good for non-agents, while a non-agent does not have a reason
to do anything.

I love reductions. But alas it looks to me like reasons and goods are not
reducible in either direction.

In 2018, the Belgians beat the Brazilians 2-1 in the 2018 World Cup soccer
quarterfinals. There are about 18 times as many Brazilians and Belgians in the
world. This raises a number of puzzles in value theory, if for simplicity we
ignore everyone but Belgians and Brazilians in the world.

An order of magnitude more people _wanted_ the Brazilians to win, and getting
what one wants is good. An order of magnitude more people would have felt
significant and appropriate _pleasure_ had the Brazilians won, and an
appropriate pleasure is good. And given both wishful thinking as well as
reasonable general presumptions about there being more talent available in a
larger population base, we can suppose that a lot more people _expected_ the
Brazilians to win, and it’s good if what one thinks is the case is in fact the
case.

You might think that the good of the many outweighs the good of the few, and
Belgians are few. But, clearly, the above facts gave very little moral reason
to the Belgian players to lose. One might respond that the above facts gave
lots of reason to the Belgians to lose, but these reasons were outweighed by
the great value of victory to the Belgian players, or perhaps the significant
intrinsic value of playing a sport as well as one can. Maybe, but if so then
just multiply both countries’ populations by a factor of ten or a hundred, in
which case the difference between the goods (desire satisfaction, pleasure and
truth of belief) is equally multiplied, but still makes little or no moral
difference to what the Belgian players should do.

Or consider this from the point of view of the Brazilian players. Imagine you
are one of them. Should the good of Brazil—around two hundred million people
caring about the game—be a crushing weight on your shoulders, imbuing
everything you do in practice and in the game with a great significance? No!
It’s still “just a game”, even if the value of the good is spread through two
hundred million people. It would be weird to think that it is a minor
pecadillo for a Belgian to slack off in practice but a grave sin for a
Brazilian to do so, because the Brazilian’s slacking hurts an order of
magnitude more people.

That said, I do think that the larger population of Brazil imbues the
Brazilians’ games and practices with _some_ not insignificant additional moral
weight than the Belgians’. It would be odd if the pleasure, desire
satisfaction and expectations of so many counted for _nothing_. But on the
other hand, it should make no significant difference to the Belgians whether
they are playing Greece or Brazil: the Belgians shouldn’t practice less
against the Greeks on the grounds that an order of magnitude fewer people will
be saddened when the Greeks lose than when Brazilians do.

However, these considerations seem to me to depend to some degree on which
decisions one is making. If Daniel is on the soccer team and deciding how hard
to work, it makes little difference whether he is on the Belgian or Brazilian
team. But suppose instead that Daniel is has two talents: he could become an
excellent nurse or a top soccer player. As a nurse, he would help relieve the
suffering of a number of patients. As a soccer player, in addition to the
intrinsic goods of the sports, he would contribute to his fellow citizens’
pleasure and desire satisfaction. In _this_ decision, it seems that the number
of fellow citizens _does_ matter. The number of people Daniel can help as a
nurse is not very dependent on the total population, but the number of people
that his soccer skills can delight varies linearly with the total population,
and if the latter number is large enough, it seems that it would be quite
reasonable for Daniel to opt to be a soccer player. So we could have a case
where if Daniel is Belgian he should become a nurse but if Brazilian then a
soccer player (unless Brazil has a significantly greater need for nurses than
Belgium, that is). But once on the team, it doesn’t seem to matter much.

The map from axiology to moral reasons is quite complex, contextual, and
heavily agent-centered. The hope of reducing moral reasons to axiology is very
slim indeed.
