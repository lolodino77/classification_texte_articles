###  Adventures in the Old Atheism, Part VII: The influence of Kant

Why do I propose that Kant’s influence did even more to bolster modern atheism
than Hume’s? Because Kant offered a _positive_ alternative to the traditional
metaphysics that upheld theism, whereas Hume’s critique is essentially
negative. To be sure, contemporary commentators are correct to hold that it is
too simple to read Hume as a mere skeptic, full stop. True, he does try to
undermine traditional metaphysical views about substance, causation, the self,
moral value, etc. But he also emphasizes that the hold such notions have over
common sense cannot be shaken by philosophical skepticism, since they are too
deeply rooted in human psychology. And for purposes of “common life,” they are
indispensable. Hume’s aim is merely to clip the wings of highfalutin
rationalist metaphysical speculation, not to undermine the convictions of the
ordinary person.

All the same, precisely for that reason, Hume’s account of _philosophy_ , if
not of common sense, is essentially destructive. Moreover, a consistent Humean
will have to take a much more modest view of natural science than contemporary
atheists are wont to do – in part because of Hume’s attack on attempts to
justify induction, and in part because the deliverances of modern physics are
hardly less abstruse and remote from common life than the rationalist
speculations he was so keen to shoot down. A Humean must also give up a
rationalistic ethics, given that, as he famously holds, there is nothing
contrary to _reason_ (but only to the sentiments of the average person) to
prefer that the entire world be destroyed than that one should suffer a
scratch to his finger. Humean arguments entail a pessimism about the powers of
human reason that doesn’t sit well with scientism or with dogmatic and
triumphalist versions of atheism (even if many atheists and adherents of
scientism naively suppose otherwise).

Kant, by contrast, tied his critique of traditional metaphysics to an
essentially positive and optimistic view of what reason could accomplish.
True, he did not think reason could penetrate into the natures of things as
they are in themselves. Since that’s what traditional metaphysics claimed to
do, and natural theology is grounded in such metaphysics, his position entails
a critique of traditional metaphysics and natural theology. However, in Kant’s
view this entailed no doubts about the rational foundations of morality or of
science (which concerns the world as it appears to us rather than as it is in
itself). A consistent Humean has to put natural theology, natural science, and
ethics in the same boat. A consistent Kantian can leave natural theology in
the boat by itself.

All the same, Kant’s critique of natural theology did not stem from the view
that it is an irrational enterprise.  Quite the contrary. The New Atheist
supposes that all theology reflects an insufficient respect for reason. Kant
argues, by contrast, that in fact natural theology reflects an _excessive
confidence_ in the power of reason. In particular, it reflects the conviction
that ultimate explanation is possible, that the world can be made intelligible
through and through. Nor did Kant suppose that natural theology looked for
such explanation in the crudely anthropomorphic “sky daddy” of New Atheist
caricature. Here is how he describes the basic impulse behind philosophical
theism in the _Critique of Pure Reason_ :

_Reason… is impelled… to seek a resting-place in the regress from the
conditioned, which is given, to the unconditioned… This is the course which
our human reason, by its very nature, leads all of us, even the least
reflective, to adopt_ …

_If we admit something as existing, no matter what this something may be, we
must also admit that there exists something which exists_ necessarily _. For
the contingent exists only under the condition of some other contingent
existence as its cause, and from this again we must infer yet another cause,
until we are brought to a cause which is not contingent, and which is
therefore unconditionally necessary_…

_Now… that which is in no respect defective, that which is in every way
sufficient as a condition, seems to be precisely the being to which absolute
necessity can fittingly be described. For while it contains the conditions of
all that is possible, it itself does not require and indeed does not allow of
any condition, and therefore satisfies… the concept of unconditioned
necessity_…

_The concept of an_ ens realissimum _is therefore, of all concepts of possible
things, that which best squares with the concept of an unconditionally
necessary being; and… we have no choice in the matter, but find ourselves
constrained to hold to it…_

_Such, then, is the natural procedure of human reason_.  _It… looks around for
the concept of that which is independent of any condition, and finds it in
that which is itself the sufficient condition of all else, that is, in that
which contains all reality. But that which is all-containing and without
limits is absolute unity, and involves the concept of a single being that is
likewise the supreme being_. (pp. 495-97, Norman Kemp Smith translation)

Reason, Kant says, cannot be satisfied as long as the explanations it posits
make reference only to what is conditioned, to contingent things. _Ultimate_
explanation must posit the existence of something which is absolutely _un_
conditioned or _necessary_. This something would be a single, unified “ _ens
realissimum_ ” or most real being, would be devoid of any defect, and would be
the source of all other reality – it would possess “the _highest_ causality…
which contains primordially in itself the sufficient ground of every possible
effect” (p. 499). Naturally, it is not the likes of Zeus or Odin that Kant has
in mind, but rather the Unmoved Mover of Aristotle and Aquinas, the One of
Plotinus, the Necessary Being of Leibniz, and so on.

The trouble with this sort of reasoning, Kant thinks, is not that its
conclusion is false – again, he was no atheist – but rather that, given his
epistemology, reason lacks the resources to transcend the empirical world and
prove the existence of a necessary or unconditioned being outside it. The
notion of causality, he argues, applies only _within_ the phenomenal world,
the world of things as they appear to us, whereas reasoning to a necessary
being would require applying it beyond that world, to the noumenal world or
things as they are in themselves. And we cannot, in his view, know the latter.

By no means does this make reasoning to such a divine first cause
superstitious or otherwise foolish. After all, Kant also thinks that the
notions of space and time apply only within the phenomenal world and not to
things as they are in themselves. You might think it _mistaken_ to suppose
that the notions of space and time apply to things as they are in themselves,
but few would regard it as superstitious, or irrational, or otherwise
contemptible to do so. By the same token, there is nothing superstitious,
irrational, or otherwise contemptible in the idea of a first uncaused cause,
even if one supposes, with Kant, that reason is incapable of validly drawing
the inference to it.

Again, in Kant’s view, it is not the abandonment of reason, but rather the
attempt to fulfill reason’s ultimate ambitions, that yields natural theology.
And reason will remain frustrated even in the face of Kantian attempts to show
that this ambition cannot be fulfilled. It is “quite beyond our utmost efforts
to _satisfy_ our understanding in this matter” but “equally unavailing are all
attempts to induce it to acquiesce in its incapacity” (p. 513).

“As follows from these considerations,” Kant says, “the ideal of the supreme
being is nothing but a _regulative principle_ of reason, which directs us to
look upon all connection in the world _as if_ it originated from an all-
sufficient necessary cause” (p. 517). Note that Kant is not saying that this
ideal is an unavoidable useful _fiction_ , but rather that it is unavoidable
and useful even if (in his view) _unprovable_.

Even so, he does not regard the affirmation of God’s existence as groundless.
On the contrary, he famously argues that a rationale for affirming it is to be
found in practical rather than pure reason, in ethics rather than in
metaphysics. Just as reason seeks an ultimate explanation, so too, Kant argues
in the _Critique of Practical Reason_ , it seeks the highest good. And the
highest good, he argues, would be the conjunction of moral virtue, which makes
us worthy of happiness, with happiness itself.

Now, we are obligated by the moral law to try to realize this highest good.
And since _ought_ implies _can_ , it must be possible to realize it. Yet it is
obviously not realized in this life, since virtuous people often suffer and
evil people often live lives of comfort and pleasure. Moreover, Kant thinks,
its realization _cannot_ be guaranteed in this life, since there is, he
thinks, no inherent necessary correlation between the demands of the moral law
and the causal order that governs the natural world. We can make sense of such
a correlation only if we postulate a supreme being who brings the two orders
into correlation (in the afterlife).

Kant does not take this to be a strict proof of God’s existence, but rather an
argument to the effect that it is reasonable to affirm God’s existence. And
once again, the idea is not that theism involves believing something contrary
to reason, but quite the opposite. Affirming God’s existence is, in Kant’s
view, precisely what is called for in order to make sense of what reason
dictates in the realm of action.

It is widely supposed that Hume and Kant put paid to the arguments of natural
theology. But their critiques largely presuppose their background views in
epistemology and metaphysics. If you don’t buy those views (and I don’t) you
needn’t accept their critiques. Yet Hume’s and Kant’s general epistemological
and metaphysical views are hardly uncontroversial, and many who suppose their
critiques of natural theology to be compelling would not accept them (if,
indeed, they even know much about them).

Moreover, as I have argued, if you do accept these background views, then to
be consistent you’d have to draw other conclusions that most New Atheist types
would not want to draw. Again, if you accept a Humean critique of natural
theology, then to be consistent you should also be skeptical about the claims
of natural science and ethics to tell us anything about objective reality. And
if you accept a Kantian critique of natural theology, then while you can
consistently take natural science and ethics to have a rational basis, you
cannot consistently treat theology with the contempt that Dawkins and Co.
typically do. Hence the lessons so many have drawn from Hume’s and Kant’s
critiques is not the one either of those critiques actually supports.

Contemporary atheism is founded on Hume's empirical atheism and Kant's
conceptual agnosticism. That's why so many of them on YouTube and Facebook
call themselves agnostic atheists: because atheism as it is recognized today
is a marriage of the two.

Are there any book-length analyses of Kant's philosophy that you could
recommend from a Thomist?  
  
The only philosophy book I've read (so far) that gives an analysis of Kant is
Peter Kreeft's book "Socrates Meets Kant" (which is written as a fictional
dialog between those 2).  
  
I know that you (Feser) have addressed some of Kant's criticisms of Natural
Theology in your books, but I was wondering if you could recommend any
Thomists that have done more in-depth work on this.

Try Etienne Gilson's The Unity of Philosophical Experience, which includes a
penetrating analysis of modern philosophy, including Kant, from a Thomist
perspective

Also Gilson's Thomist Realism and The Critique of Knowledge and also
Methodical Realism. The second one is good for beginners.

Also the header of your last section fooled me. "The afterlife of Hume and
Kant". Your previous section talked about how Kant believed moral values
needed the next life, so I was expecting a discussion of how Kant's view of
the afterlife was different from Hume's annihilationism.

That Hume could be so confident that he would cease to be is quite funny with
his view on casuality XD

I'm no trained philosopher, but Kant's phenomenal/noumenal distinction seems
really suspicious to me. It's hard for me to even understand why you would
want to make such a distinction except unless you were motivated by the desire
to deny the force of arguments for the existence of God.  
  
I don't get how the nouminal world can really be "things as they are" if they
are entirely causally inert with respect to how we perceive things. This seems
like a very "russel's teapot" kind of situation where if we can't draw any
conclusions about things as they are, why are we even bothering to try to talk
about "things as they are"?

 _if we can't draw any conclusions about things as they are, why are we even
bothering to try to talk about "things as they are"?_  
  
I concur: the distinction is extremely suspect. For one thing, is there any
"things as they ARE" **about** things "as they appear to us" (i.e. the
phenomena)? Or really, how could there NOT be any aspect to "things as they
appear to us" that "really are"? For instance, do they REALLY seem that way,
or is it "just an appearance?" How, indeed, could we speak **meaningfully**
about "things as they seem to us" without those things _having_
characteristics (even if only seeming so - they SEEM to have certain
characteristics, and that FACT is something _that is so_ even apart from
seeming). It is, further, utterly silly to simply posit the world of phenomena
being utterly divorced from "things as they really are", and then talk about
it with everyone else as if _your_ experience had ANY relationality with them
(or even their sheer existence). Your words would be (always) sheer gibberish
to everyone else, and (at best) only _seeming_ to you to have any sense at
all.  
  
It seems to have all the worst drawbacks of the "mind is merely electron
actions in neurons" approach, and then some.

 _It's hard for me to even understand why you would want to make such a
distinction except unless you were motivated by the desire to deny the force
of arguments for the existence of God._  
  
The motivation stems from Kant's attempt to respond to Humean skepticism. Kant
thinks metaphysical principles (e.g. every event must have a cause) can only
be justified in virtue of their expressing conditions of the possibility of
experience, viz. the conditions objects must satisfy in order to be objects of
experience _for us_. But this suggests the need to distinguish between two
says of considering objects, namely in relation to subjects with our forms of
cognition (things as they appear to us) and independently of such relations
(things as they are in themselves).  
  
Now, I'm not a Kantian, and I don't think his views are ultimately
satisfactory, but I hope this brief summary shows it isn't some misguided
attempt to undermine natural theology.

@Anon  
  
"It's hard for me to even understand why you would want to make such a
distinction except unless you were motivated by the desire to deny the force
of arguments for the existence of God."  
  
Well, Kant starts with the humean thesis that sense data can only generate
contigent knowledge. He quickly realized that empiricism is dumb, for we do
have necessary knowledge, so he was a sort of rationalist early. Necessary
knowledge comes from reason.  
  
But them Kant understood that sense data is pretty much how we have
information about reality, so if our necessary knowledge does not come from
the senses them it either:  
  
1\. Has no basis on reality and is mere play with definitions(which smart
empiricists do defend).  
  
2\. Come from something else.  
  
The prussian argued that at least mathematics is a sort of necessary knowledge
that is not created by language, so 2 won. His answer was that we can know
some truths about how we happen to organize sense data by analysing the
necessary conditions to our experience to it to be how it is. For instance,
every experience we have is in time, it has a sucession and all that, so we
can derive several truths about that(inded, mathematics would have his origin
on the forms of time and space).  
  
And so, by knowing this structure we could show that every possible experience
we could have need to obey a certain structure and so gather several truths
about how things appear to us. This method is worthless to know things we cant
empirically know, though.

Of course, this does not means that we do not know ANYTHING about how things
really are, for Kant argued against things really having the characteristics
our innate structure puts on they, like the forms of space and time or the
categories like casuality. Read someday Sebastian Gardner book on Kant to get
the details, it is a very good account of Kant views and arguments.  
  
Academics do dispute the view that the thing-itself is a separate thing from
phenomena, the two-worlds interpretation, but i do feel like it gets close to
Kant intend. Specially if one see things like his defense of free will.  
  
About a way of making this view sound coherent, Schopenhauer did a good job of
deriving some conclusions about the thing-itself. Of all the germans, i still
do not know which took Kant view to the more coherent direction, but he got to
a interesting point.

Garrigou_LaGrange, "God: His Nature and Existence" 2Vols. is still a classic.

Also Brian Davies, OP "Thinking About God."  
and Dr Feser's "Aguinas."

Would you say Kant was a univocist? It seems that by saying reason cannot get
to the ultimate foundation of reality because it cannot access things as they
are in themselves, he is suggesting that there is no appropriate analogical
predication of being.

Oh boy, the prussian would not exactly be a fan of being here XD  
  
"Yet Hume’s and Kant’s general epistemological and metaphysical views are
hardly uncontroversial, and many who suppose their critiques of natural
theology to be compelling would not accept them (if, indeed, they even know
much about them)."  
  
Perfect. If one uses their criticism while not really accepting their views
them you know that there is no serious thinker in front of you.  
  
And i do find Kant system very good to a atheist, probably the best dificult
to natural theology, but i admit that reading your post make me reconsider the
possibility of a kantian atheist, Dr. Feser.  
  
The kantian "moral argument" seemed kinda weak to me, for pratical and
theoretical reason could just be contradictory and that is all. But this would
seriously wreak the power of reason and the confidence on science and
morality, so yea, kantism loses its appeal(one might as well go to something
even more modest, like Hayek).

You know, i got a idea:  
  
"Moreover, Kant thinks, its realization cannot be guaranteed in this life,
since there is, he thinks, no inherent necessary correlation between the
demands of the moral law and the causal order that governs the natural world.
We can make sense of such a correlation only if we postulate a supreme being
who brings the two orders into correlation (in the afterlife)".  
  
Can't not one, in a wink to Schopenhauer, use this reasoning to get as well to
something more eastern like a sort of moksha? It would require a
pantheist/panentheist deity being the thing-itself and a completely detached
moral life(Kantian ethics meet the Gita!) would help one become one with God
and all that.  
  
Besides not being atheistic, a weakness of it when compared with theist
kantism is that it would not be capable of having objective morality, for
there is no real "I" that is the author of my acts, but it could make Kant
argument less probable.

I've grown weary of abstract discussion of racial issues from both the left
and right. It seems to me that if we were serious about healing the racial
divide we'd be focused on specific, bold, plans of action directed towards
that end. So for example...  
  
In the American context, how about totally free education (books, tuition,
room and board, everything) at every level for historically oppressed
minorities, paid for by the super-rich, and continued until such time as the
wealth gap between whites and minorities was erased. Specific, bold,
measurable plan of action with a defined vision of success.  
  
Whatever the merits of this particular idea may be, it serves as an example of
the kind of things we ought to talking about.  
  
In the Catholic context, the leader to follow would be Catholic Charities, and
not ideologists of any flavor.  

That could only serve to increase the wage gap as it will encourage a lot of
people who would otherwise go into lucrative trades to get useless degrees
(because hey it’s free) and just delay working by four years. So there is no
guarantee it would have the intended effect.  
  
But more importantly, that would be pure consequentialism. It would be the sin
of racism to favor particular groups of people on the basis of race alone. It
would also drive up the cost of tuition because now a significant portion of
the population would be guaranteed to pay for tuition by the power of the US
Government.  
  
Maybe something like a state-funded scholarship for Sons and Daughters of
slaves could be legitimate. But even that would probably need to be somewhat
selective.

What makes you think this plan would eliminate the wealth gap between white
and minorities? And why is eliminating that wealth gap inherently a good
thing?  
  
Groups achieve different outcomes. That’s not necessarily a sign of
discrimination. Often, it’s a sign of cultural differences between the two.
Should we also aim to eliminate the wealth gap between whites and Asians?
(Asians are usually on top).

Isn't that what affirmative action effectively already does to some extent,
which, incidentally, is on the chopping block? Except here, no rich people
need to shave any money off their bank accounts. And hasn't it failed? And
wasn't it just a lazy way of pretending to solve what is essentially a
cultural problem? (Recent African immigrants, by contrast, do very well,
academically and professionally, even after our previous American schools
teach them that, despite what their lying eyes tell them, they are, in fact,
oppressed, that there's no sense in denying it, and the only way out of the
invisible cage is through rage and self-pity.)  
  
But more to the point... By making things concrete, you make them tractable,
and when you make them tractable, you make it possible to arrive at a
goalpost. But who wants that? Once a problem is resolved, careers and
institutions built around the problem are threatened because you've taken away
their very raison d'etre. They no longer have the cudgel or leverage they once
had.  
  
The same is true of feminism. Many feminist demands have been met. But has
feminism gone away? If anything, it's become even more radicalized. People
often project their personal dissatisfactions and discomforts onto some
external, broad "common cause". Doing so allows them to feel in control, like
they've named the beast. Living a boring life? Must be because of racism. Not
getting what you want? Must be because of sexism or misogyny. And once the
demands of such people are met, they discover they're still where they were
and this is infuriating. A rational person would take this as an opportunity
for reflection, but a prideful person will simply double down. If things are
still shabby, it's necessarily because we haven't gone far enough! Thus begins
a race to the bottom...

"until such time as the wealth gap between whites and minorities was erased"  
  
That's the 'equity' in 'antiracism'. It's a non-starter.

 _I've grown weary of abstract discussion of racial_  
  
What defines "race". It has had different meanings at different times, and in
different contexts.  
  
_of racial issues_  
  
Which issues? No, **specifically** which issues? Those of injustice? What
about injustices commited by blacks at blacks? Oh, do you mean injusticed
committed by blacks on whites? Shoot, reverse that, I mean by whites on
blacks? What about all the other kinds of racial injustices?  
  
_if we were serious about healing the racial divide_  
  
What if only SOME of us are serious about it? Can we who are serious overcome
the intent of those who don't want it changed? What about democracy?  
  
_we'd be focused on specific, bold, plans_  
  
I have a specific, bold plan: every white man marries a black woman, and every
black man marries a white woman. In 2 generations, there will be no racial
divide at all.  
  
_how about totally free education_  
  
Mere "education" doesn't do it, if (a) the recipient isn't willing or able to
**receive** it. (Free) public high schools have enormous drop-out rates in
some areas, (mostly by minorities but not solely) - they theoretically have a
free education in front of them, but they decline it. If you re-make _college_
education to meet the standards of public schools, you'll get the same result.  
  
_Specific, bold, measurable plan of action with a defined vision of success._  
  
If you want to define success in such a narrow way, you guarantee failure in
respect of _other kinds_ of success. But aside from that: if your attempt were
to meet with ANTI-success (say, increased income gap), would you then **re-
pay** the people you took the money from to pay for that effort? (Because,
after all, it would have been demonstrated to be unjust.) And...whose money
would you use to do that?  
  
If you want to state a measurable outcome as "success", then you have to
equally identify what constitutes a "failure" of the attempt. And you have to
account for the _implications_ of failure, social and otherwise. Which means:
"free" might not, actually, be free.

Lets ignore the broad discussion for a bit.  
  
@First Anon  
  
"But more importantly, that would be pure consequentialism. It would be the
sin of racism to favor particular groups of people on the basis of race
alone."  
  
Okay, this does not work. Phil is not proposing this idea because he happens
to like minorities. He is proposing it because these folks are on a quite
crappy situation when compared to white folks. I understand that a group
facing inferior living conditions, oportunities etc by injust factors that we
can solve is a injustice that should be tackled in order to the common good of
the place to be better realized.  
  
Notice that i'am not discussing if the plan would work or what causes the
inequalities, not my turf, only the claim that helping out a particular race
as a matter of public police is necessarily racist.  

 _In the American context, how about totally free education (books, tuition,
room and board, everything) at every level for historically oppressed
minorities, paid for by the super-rich, and continued until such time as the
wealth gap between whites and minorities was erased._  
  
Amazing how so many plans to erase a racial divide (which must always be
illicit and evil, not at all natural) inevitably turns into a not-so-subtle
payday for people. There's a reason why "free" room and board, tuition, and
education is paired with the requirement that it be "paid for" by someone
else: because it's not free. And it's not going to be the super-rich paying
either.  
  
If the concern is to provide education as cheaply and freely as possible,
maybe we should consider price caps on tuition. The fact is, with the modern
internet, we are capable of providing a massive amount of education for dirt
cheap compared to what traditional, outdated institutions currently offer. In
fact, we already do so: see Coursera, or all kinds of other online options.  
  
But this solution, while clearly viable and even superior to the traditional
alternative, would not enrich the bloated, inefficient education system. And,
for all the cries of racism and inequality, circumventing that kind of payout
is not a price the loudest antiracists are willing to pay.  
  
That's one of the real problems: at some point we have to be willing to ask
whether the person crying "racism!" actually has a point, or if they're full
of it. They often are. There's a real conversation that needs to be had.

W.r.t. tuition and all this promising of free stuff, it's all a grift. At
Yale, for example, the number of employees working in administration is equal
to the number of students, all handsomely payed, I imagine. I recall hearing
recently that at some school (possibly Yale again), there are 76 "diversity
officers". Today's universities are money-making scams that offer a mediocre
education at an exorbitant price on top of the "ideological homogenization"
that is blatantly apparent when you talk to a recent college graduate.  
  
The only way to fix all these shenanigans is to cut universities off from the
government cheese. This will toss the bloated administration out onto the
street and cause a drop in tuition. Further market pressure will force
universities to cut tuition further because now you can't go to Uncle Sam for
financial aid.

It's a grift, absolutely. And I think it's an even deeper grift than that, and
not exclusive to the left.  
  
But what bothers me about this particular subject is that there has been an
absolutely, positively *insane* advancement in the ease of education in the
past couple of decades. In less than a single lifetime we went from books
almost exclusively being available on dead trees to having copies of massive
libraries able to fit in our pockets. And not just books, but videos,
interactive instructions, and more. We are swimming in a disgusting abundance
of free and accessible education which can be accessed for next to nothing, at
will, 24/7, anywhere on the planet. Education has never been easier and more
attainable than ever before for everyone in the world. Especially for English
speakers.  
  
Somehow, despite this being abundant and obvious, we still are pretending that
the only way to (say) learn French is to go six figures in debt and get a
French degree from an accredited university that has a massive staff. Same for
learning the Humanities, Physics or C++. The exceptions to this exist, but are
few.  
  
It is maddening.

Thanks to all for your discussion of a particular specific, bold, plan of
action. I find any such analysis to be superior to vague claims such as
"racism is bad, and isn't that sad" which seem to dominate so much of our
culture's discussion of race.  
  
It's entirely reasonable to challenge, and perhaps dismiss, any particular
plan of action. But the way to do that is to replace one plan with another,
not to merely content ourselves with rejectionism.  
  
What typically happens is that somebody will suggest some plan, everyone else
will immediately starting proclaiming it wrong, while offering no plan of
their own, and so nothing happens, and centuries of racial divide continues.  
  
For myself, I see no good reason why the top 1% of our society, who control at
least a third of the nation's wealth, and are those who have most benefited
from America's rigged system, should not lift up those who have been most
oppressed by it. Such an effort need not cost the average person a nickel, so
I see no good reason to sweep such an opportunity away with a wave of our
hands. Certainly we can add other plans in addition to this one, that would be
great.

Phil,  
  
Personally, I reject the conviction that commonly understood racism is some
overwhelming evil and the root cause of a seemingly ever-expanding list of
social ills to begin with. Pointing at differences in outcomes along racial
lines is not sufficient to establish that. It's extremely popular to regard it
as established beyond reasonable doubt, I grant. I'm willing to go against the
grain there.  
  
But what's interesting here is that, in spite of my view, I nevertheless *did*
offer an alternative -- after all, increased access to education is a worthy
goal itself. But you seem to have overlooked my suggestions. Perhaps it was
invisible precisely because it involved no massive wealth transfer to teachers
and activists. And if that's the reason it didn't even register, well. Doesn't
that say a lot?  
  
Incidentally, I have a very good reason, as a non-super-rich person, to
nevertheless oppose this plan that would supposedly target, exclusively, the
super-rich: if push comes to shove and it's decided that taking wealth for
some grand and noble purpose MUST be done, then I have other priorities for
that money.  
  
So yes, I'll sweep that opportunity away with a wave of my hands, and offer my
own opportunities in its place, if I must.

@Phil Tanny, I can appreciate the desire to avoid getting mired in perpetual
kvetching, but it is untrue that unless I can provide an alternative solution,
I have no right to dismiss or reject an idea.  
  
I also disagree with the problem statement and the premise that the solution
involves some kind of massive payout by the so-called 1%. First, a wealth
disparity between racial groups is not per se a problem to be solved. Second,
if it is a problem, it isn't necessarily the result of any kind of racism in
any tangible sense. It could be cultural, and I claim that the problem is
largely cultural (for example, Thomas Sowell, for example, opines that the
disintegration of the black family beginning in the 1960s, often assisted by
well-meaning social programs, has had a devastating effect on black Americans;
I would also mention ideologies of perpetual powerlessness and victimhood that
both demoralize and divert energy away from constructive activity toward
ineffectual grievance and blame). Third, even if it were racist, I don't see
what the rich have to do with it unless you can show that they employ racist
policies specifically to impoverish certain racial groups (the targeting of
the rich under the pretext that they benefit from a rigged system is the kind
of sloppy and unjust rationalization I would expect from a Marxist who foments
class conflict). Fourth, throwing money at problems is precisely what (per
Sowell) created much of the problems we're seeing today. NGOs, often run by
wealthy philanthropists, offer a relevant example of how funneling money and
free goods into causes can cause more damage than it solves (the destruction
of the Nigerian cotton and textile industry through mitumba, the destruction
of Haitian farming through free rice given long after a crisis has passed,
even something like the effect of TOMS on African shoe manufacturing and
repair). I'm not saying *charitable* work cannot help, but I would be very
suspicious of any "philanthropic" or even government-mandated solution given
their track record. More importantly, no amount of money can solve the basic
problem which, again, is cultural. Maybe Catholic missionaries could play a
role here. The Catholic Church is, after all, what turned even the pig-chasing
savages of Europe into something resembling a civilization. Only after the
Church has given structure to the mission to lift black America out of
spiritual and moral decay and, secondarily, poverty, does talk of money make
sense because only then can it be used and allocated prudently and with care.
But expect also a good deal of opposition from those who pretend to be
concerned for such minorities, especially when the Catholic Church is involved
and from those whose careers depend on maintaining the present status quo.

How confident are you that a) your reading represents the view of the book,
and b) that the papacy was uninterested as opposed to ill-informed or silent
(per your expectations) for other reasons?

I have absolutely no time nor interest to get into this in depth, but this I
have to point out:  
Ed's claim: the kind of slavery the black africans were subject to - chattel
slavery - was taught to be intrinsically evil  
Your claim: Popes actively supported the slavery of black africans  
The claim of the person you're quoting from: Popes ignored/ did nothing to
protect black africans

Hi Aizen and Oktavian,  
  
Aizen, you write:  
  
"Ed's claim: the kind of slavery the black africans were subject to - chattel
slavery - was taught to be intrinsically evil  
Your claim: Popes actively supported the slavery of black africans  
The claim of the person you're quoting from: Popes ignored/ did nothing to
protect black africans"  
  
Well, here's what Adiele's book, which I quoted from has to say on the subject
(see p. 469):  
  
"In the course of making this investigation, the basic question that guided
this work is: Did the popes of the Church actively involve themselves in the
enslavement of Black Africans during the Transatlantic slave trade? At the end
of this investigation, the findings from the historical sources available to
this study unfortunately tended to answer this basic question in the positive.
This slave trade was not only supported and approved by the Catholic  
Church but also received the blessings of the popes for a good number of
reasons."  
  
Commenting on Pope Nicholas V's bull, "Dum Diversas," the author writes (p.
313):  
  
"The remaining part of the main body of this Bull contained the very lines and
words which indicated the active role of the leadership of the Church in the
Black African enslavement."  
  
Oktavian: please don't accuse me of misrepresenting Adiele. I spent several
hours looking through his book online last night, before commenting on it. And
yes, I'm pretty confident of my interpretation of the author's views, as I
managed to skim through most of his book, focusing especially on the papacy.  
  
You might also want to read what the author says about the curse of Ham on pp.
166-191. It was endorsed by Pope Pius IX as late as 1873.  
  
Re chattel slavery: Aizen, if your only quarrel is with the kind of slavery
that claims to own a man's soul as well as his body, then I respectfully
submit that your claim is untenable in practice. The soul cannot be free
unless the body is. You cannot coherently claim to own a man's labor without
claiming to own the man himself. As Elizabeth Anscombe famously put it in her
inaugural lecture as Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge University in 1971,
titled, "Causality and Determination": "My actions are mostly physical
movements; if these physical movements are physically predetermined by
processes which I do not control, then my freedom is perfectly illusory." And
I might add: "if my physical movements are determined by the whims of a slave-
master whom I cannot control, then my freedom is perfectly illusory."

Having read this, the author fails to make the kind of fine distinctions that
Feser makes between the kinds of slavery the Church accepted as moral and the
kinds that didn't. It also argues that the Protestant tradition of the Curse
of Ham was a major influence on Catholic thought, which is kind of bonkers.  
  
All in all, for all of its "evidence", the author made a serious conceptual
error that rendered the entire argument a non-sequitur.

@Vincent Torley, I was being charitable to Adiele by giving him the benefit of
the doubt. I think that, given the current political climate, it is entirely
reasonable to be wary of "scholarship" on the subject of racism given how
easily academics churn out the most ridiculous tracts on the subject.

Hi Mister Geocon and Oktavian,  
  
Belief in the Curse of Ham has a long Catholic pedigree. Most of the following
quotations are taken from Adiele's book.  
  
Several Church Fathers (e.g. St. Basil of Caesarea, St. John Chrysostom, St.
Ambrose, St. Augustine of Hippo) all taught that the human institution of
slavery had its origin in Ham's sinfulness. They did not link this to Africa.
However, St. Jerome disturbingly refers to "Ethiopians" (Kushites) as "black
and cloaked in the filth of sin," adding: "At one time we were Ethiopians in
our vices and sins. How so? Because our sins had blackened us."  
  
Surprisingly, the first text to explicitly link the curse of Ham to Black
Africans was the Babylonian Talmud, completed around 600 AD.  
  
In the tenth century, Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria (877-940) was the
first Christian Church leader to identify Black Africans as being among those
afflicted by the Curse of Ham:  
  
“Cursed be Ham, and may he be servant of his brothers...He himself and his
descendants, who are the Egyptians, the Negroes, the Ethiopians, and it is
said the  
Barbari.”  
  
According to the famous Christian geographical work "Cursor Mundi" (1300
A.D.), Noah's son Shem and his descendants were freemen who dwelt in Asia.
Japhet and his descendants were nobles and knights who came to live in Europe,
while "Ham, the accursed" and his descendants were slaves who were sent to
Africa.  
  
In the 15th century, the famous Portuguese chronicler Gomes Eannes de Azurara
(1410-1474) appealed to the writings of a 12th century archbishop of Toledo,
Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada (1170-1247) to support his contention that Black
Africans were doomed to servitude because they were the accursed descendants
of Ham:  
  
"The servitude of non-Muslim Moors (West Africans) resulted from the curse,
which,  
after the Deluge, Noah laid upon his son Ham, cursing him in this way: 'that
his race  
should be subject to all the other races of the world. And from his race these
Blacks are descended,' as wrote the Archbishop Don Roderick of Toledo and
Josephus in his Book on the Antiquities of the Jews, and Walter, with other
authors who have spoken of the generations of Noah from the time of his going
out of the Ark."  
  
In the 15th century, Dominican Friar Johannes Annius of Viterbo (1432-1502)
wrote that the curse of Ham forced him into exile in Africa: “As a result of
his sin, Ham is exiled to Africa.”  
  
In the 18th century, French biblical scholar and Benedictine abbot Augustine
Calmet (1672-1757) wrote in a work titled “Dictionary of the Holy Bible”
(1722): “Noah assigned to Ham the nations of Africa. The occasion of the color
of his sons was that Noah being one day asleep discovered his nakedness, and
Ham passed that way without covering him; on which accounts his descendants
are born with black complexion, and the gift of the prophecy was taken from
them.”  
  
In the 19th century, John England, the first Catholic bishop of Charleston,
USA, wrote in a letter to US Secretary of State John Forsyth (1780-1841) that
the enslavement of Black Africans was entirely lawful, because of the sin
committed by their ancestor, Ham:  
  
“Since every Catholic must accept Adam's fall as an essential ingredient in
the human condition, he should likewise believe that it certainly was not then
against the divine law for Shem and Japheth to use the services of the Black
race, since their progenitor had been cursed by God for his sinful conduct.”  
  
Finally, Pope Pius IX issued a Prayer for the Conversion of Africa through the
Office of the Sacred Congregation of Rites on October 2, 1873, in which he
declared: "“Let us pray for the most wretched Ethiopians in Central Africa,
that Almighty God may at length remove the curse of Cham from their hearts,
and grant them the blessing to be found only in Jesus Christ, our God and
Lord." This prayer came with a 300-day indulgence.  
  
Is it "kind of bonkers" to say that the Curse of Ham was a major influence on
Catholic thought? I think not.

WCB  
  
Excellent post. Kudos. Do not forget Nicholas V's bulls Dum diversas and
Romanus Pontifex that commanded Portugeuse kings to impose perpetual slavery
on Africans as pagans and thus enemies of God.

Would you care to define “historically oppressed minorities”, or give a set of
criteria for choosing them?

That list would seem to include a good number of peoples. As a Pole, allow me
to submit my own people who, by the way, have never received a grosz of
compensation for what was effectively a 50 year Soviet occupation, for the
unfathomable destruction, savagery, and death caused by the Nazis and Soviets
during WWII, for the 18th century Partitions, for the massive destruction of
the Second Northern War, for the various massacres carried out by the Teutonic
Order, for the massacres carried out by the Mongols, for the slave trade (Ah,
yes. Didn't you know? The word "slave" comes from Slav. They were highly
prized.), etc, etc.  
  
Oh, and for all those Polish jokes.

How to define historically oppressed minorities? I wouldn't, as that would
seem to lead directly to a never ending 'who is the bigger victim'
competition. In the American context, I would aim practical remedies at the
two most significant victim groups, Black Americans and Native Americans.

 _and death caused by the Nazis and Soviets during WWII_  
  
Oh, the Polish participated in the Holocaust too. They were not just innocent
bystandards while the Germans did everything: Hitler didn't have that much
free time and extra hands and feet. Same thing with Croatians during the
Ustashe, which is why I'm not holding my breath for the canonization of Bl.
Aloysius Stepinac. This is also why I don't exactly admire Polish nationalist
saints like John Paul II, and it makes me wonder whether the Vatican hands out
halos too eagerly.  
  
Of course, there were many Croats and Poles who resisted the Holocaust, and
are included among the Righteous Among the Nations in the Yad va Shem
Holocaust Museum in Israel.

@Infinite Growth, there's that ignorant and vicious trope again. I'll bite,
though this is a digression as my point was to show that even much more
tangible claims toward restitution remain unaddressed if we wish to talk
restitution.  
  
Were there Poles who committed crimes during WWII, who went along with Nazi,
or Soviet, crimes? Obviously. I feel silly even having to state the obvious
because this is something that follows not from empirical fact, but from the
general proposition that the moral status of the actions of individuals during
wartime does not conform strictly to the divide of the front line. There were
righteous Germans and righteous Russians and wicked Poles. So what? Judas
betrayed Christ, but the Apostles on the whole or as a corporate body were not
agents of the Sanhedrin. We can say the same about Jews who betrayed both
their fellow Jews and committed crimes against gentile Poles, but we rarely
talk about those, so why the special pleading here?  
  
As a matter of empirical fact, we must remember things like:  
  
1\. The Polish state never collaborated with the Nazis. Compare that with
other European governments. This refusal to collaborate, and the formation of
Europe's largest resistance, happened at enormous cost. This, in addition to
Nazi crimes against the populace.  
2\. Even the number of only those Poles recognized by Yad Vashem outstrips the
combined number of people recognized from all other nations combined.
Proportion and scale matter.  
3\. The penalties for aiding Jews were uniquely and incomparably severe in
Poland (involving the execution of the person aiding, his family, maybe
neighbors, etc). And yet, point (2).  
4\. Poland was home to something like 80% of world Jewry at the time of the
war and the majority of the world's Jews for centuries. Any occurrence of
antipathy (and don't forget Jewish bigotry, which did exist) at the time of
the war was driven by economic, but also cultural, political, social, and
historical factors, not racial hatred. That is, there was no impulse to
exterminate any group and any crimes committed were isolated incidents of
criminal opportunism taken during the chaos of wartime, not systematic
programs of liquidation or some broad expression of national hatred. There
were also incidents where Poles were forced under threat of death to
participate in Nazi operations, incidents that some Jewish authors have
grotesquely misrepresented either maliciously or through incompetence (e.g.,
Jan Gross).  
  
So I think the claim you've made is unjust and irresponsible. Sadly, it also
plays into recent opportunistic politics.

N.b. I am the Anon that wrote the above post responding to @Infinite Growth (I
had selected "Anonymous" by accident from the drop down).  
  
To make clear what I meant by recent politics, take, for example, Act H.R.1226
and Senate Act S.447 through which certain organizations, with the aid of the
US government, are trying to extract massive sums of money from the Polish
state for so-called heirless property that once belonged to Jews. According to
both Polish law and the general legal principle followed virtually everywhere,
property without a legal heir reverts to the state after the death of its
owner. If a legal heir exists, he is free to pursue restitution like everyone
else through the Polish courts. The absurd position of certain groups is that
the Polish government should treat these cases in a extraordinary way and
offer broad restitution anyway, not to any heirs, because of course they don't
exist, but to organizations and people who are not legal heirs. And recall
that this was property held by Polish citizens as Polish Jews were Polish
citizens. By reinforcing the notion that Poles, as a corporate body, are
guilty of collaborating in the criminal program of the Nazis, it becomes
easier to make claims on the Polish state. Heirless property, combined with a
sprinkle of customary special pleading, misrepresentation, and the thought-
diffusing VIP pass that is the word "Holocaust", provides a convenient
opportunity for unscrupulous organizations to illegitimately extract billions
of dollars from the Polish state by exploiting the emotional force of a
historical tragedy. Perhaps such organizations should instead direct their
claims to Berlin as the German state is responsible for handling the
restitution of Jewish property lost through actions of the Nazi regime. As I
mentioned already, the Poles have not received a dime of restitution for the
absolute obliteration of their country, its cities, its cultural heritage, not
to mention the torture, exploitation, and deaths of millions of its citizens,
Jew and gentile alike.

"Oh, the Polish participated in the Holocaust too."  
  
One word: Kapo.

 _One word: Kapo_  
  
At the Belsen Trial, Joseph Kramer and 44 other kapos were found guilty of war
crimes, so no, that doesn't exonerate them. :)

I wasn't trying to exonerate them. I'm more than happy to talk about their
complicity, in fact. The Poles were victims of the Holocaust. If someone wants
to talk about the crimes of particular Poles, we can start talking about the
crimes of the Kapo. And maybe we'll bring the Soviets into the mix too.  
  
In fact, perhaps we should do that regardless.

According to conventional American history, the USA became great because it
was a self-made country built by the Protestant work ethic. According to Dr.
Martin Luther King the USA became great because we exploited black slaves and
poor immigrants. :)

When based on a lie, a sound reasoning can be used to reach any conclusion,
true or otherwise.  
  
Small example: is the statement "if 1=2 then 37=-1" true or false? It is
actually true and simple to demonstrate using some arithmetic rules:  
Step 1: 1=2 (deduct 1 from both sides)  
Step 2: 0=1 (multiply both sides by 38)  
Step 3: 0=38 (deduct 1 from both sides)  
Step 4: -1=37 q.e.d.  
  
In short, "if A then B" is always true if A is false. All you need to do is to
convince someone that A is actually true so that with sound reasoning you may
conclude any consequence B at your convenience.

BERTAND RUSSELL: From a falsehood any statement can be derived.  
  
HECKLER: Prove that if 2=1 then you are the Pope!  
  
BERTRAND RUSSELL: The pope and I are two, therefore the Pope and I are one.

In another 30 or 40 yrs we white people will no longer be the majority race.

Logical explosion. From contradictions, any thing can follow. Including
nonsense and untruths. This has been well known from the middle ages by
logicians  
  
Goggle logical explosion for more.  
  
WCB

The paradox of the material implication seems to belie this fact. "If the moon
is made of green cheese then I will grow 800ft", when analyzed with respect to
truth functionality, is true. But most people would say it's false, because
the consequent has no logical connection to the antecedent.

Yes, there does seem to be a problem in referring to the consequent as
"following from" the false antecedent. Certainly the consequent isn't being
_caused by_ the antecedent.  
  
One of the other problems is that the "proof" of the consequent always runs
through a statement or series of statements that _hold in normal conditions_ ,
but it is unclear that they ALSO hold in conditions that obtain with the false
antecedent. In the above example given by our esteemed Anonymous above, if we
assume 1=2, does it STILL remain true that "equals subtracted from equals make
equals", which he uses to get the second step? Maybe not. So then you have to
hypothesize not only "1=2" but also "and all the usual rules of arithmetic
remain valid". But that, of course, is the difficulty: if 1=2, it seems
unlikely that we can simply "let" all the other rules remain intact. So then
that calls the assertions of the intervening steps into doubt.

@Tony:  
  
"In the above example given by our esteemed Anonymous above, if we assume 1=2,
does it STILL remain true that "equals subtracted from equals make equals",
which he uses to get the second step? Maybe not."  
  
The sentence between quotes is a special instance of "substitution of equals"
principle; it can be stated as an implication "forall x, y : x = y => f x = f
y" where f is a function (1), which in turn is a reflection of the mantra
"first order logic is extensional".  
  
Technical note(s):  
(1) you can even universally quantify over f, which redounds to the
indiscernability of identicals; but then, depending on how exactly you are
setting things up, you are moving to second order logic which is generally not
a good idea because important results like the compactness theorem fail; but
this can be worked around in a number of ways.

_Natural law theory in the Aristotelian-Thomistic (A-T) tradition is grounded
in a metaphysics of essentialism and teleology, and in turn grounds a theory
of natural rights. This chapter offers a brief exposition of the metaphysical
ideas in question, explains how the A-T tradition takes a natural law moral
system to follow from them, and also explains how in turn the existence of
certain basic natural rights follows from natural law. It then explains how
the teleological foundations of natural law entail not only that natural
rights exist, but also that they are limited or qualified in certain crucial
ways. The right to free speech is used as a case study to illustrate these
points. Finally, the chapter explains the sense in which the natural rights
doctrine generated by A-T natural law theory amounts to a theory of human
rights, specifically_.

contributors to the volume.

Neat. This way of getting to human rights is one of the cooler parts of the
view, i had never heard something similar before knowing A-T take.  
  
But i do wonder myself if using the language is a good thing, for it seems to
lead to one thinking of more popular views of human rights, whose emphasis on
autonomy tend to just take us quite far from thomism or most classical ethical
views.

It's not new, actually (but well-argued in Thomism):  
  
Catechism of the Catholic Church 1929: "The person represents the ultimate end
of society, which is ordered to him"  
CCC 1930: "Respect for the human person entails respect for the rights that
flow from his dignity as a creature. These rights are prior to society and
must be recognized by it.". Edmunde Burke was very allergic to these
principles.  
  
The article should be a great contribution to the handbook. Some of the other
titles look very interesting too.

I have heard and seen many people raise this as a caution against using the
language of "rights" at all. While it makes sense to be wary precisely for the
reason Talmid offers, I am not sure we have a good escape route that avoids
speaking in terms of "rights" and indeed "natural rights". The problem is that
even more basic to "right **S** " is "the right" as in "the good" kind of
action, opposed to the wrong kind of action, and we can't really eliminate
_right_ in that context. We might come up with a parallel word or phrase to
use, I suppose, but even that wouldn't eradicate that "natural right" still
has a valid meaning equal to that new phrase. And since the connection to
natural law is critical, and since "natural law" isn't going anywhere as a
term, I think we are pretty much stuck. We just have to insist on the
distinctions.

@Miguel Cervantes  
  
True, the cathecism does use the language. I tend to associate it with St.
Pope John Paul II, but i supposed it started earlier.  
  
@Tony  
  
Yea, this is the problem. We do need to find a way out, but it feels like the
natural rights folks won that one.  
  
The best i can think of is starting to focus, say, on talking on the wrongness
of taking life or in the goodness of supporting human life instead of talking
of a right to life,, but it sounds weird.

The "language" certainly started long before. It's inseparable from the
Christian idea of human personality as something towards which society is
oriented. The article mentioned in this post is about this Christian concept
of human rights. It's very clear in St, Thomas but less so in Aristotle, for
whom natural law was not necessarily universal and timeless. The teleological
approach is also lacking in Aristotle's purely secularist view. Chesterton was
surely right when (referring to philosophies of the Far East and Asia) he said
that nothing had been thought up there which the Mediterranean had not already
thought of. Standing apart from all this, the Christian view - going back to
the Patriarchs of the OT, is unique.

Correct, my man. I was just referring to the way we say that someone has a
natural right to this or that. I dont remember seeing this on Aquinas, for
instance, even if the saint argued for what we would call natural rights.

St. Thomas didn't need to. In his day, Burkean-type ideologies did not yet
exist. They maintain that individual rights are established, not by nature,
but by civil society. Since the eighteenth century, because of the spread of
such ideas (and that of distorted liberal "natural law" ideologies), the
Church had to speak more explicitly of rights based on nature.

This is the right approach, however, from what I've read so far it's
overcomplicated by Aristotle and Aquinas. The Greek model for human rights is
not universal but tied to the idea of AUTOCHTHONY and would JUSTIFY chattel
slavery.  
Paul addressed AUTOCHTHONY directly in his Mars hill discourse in Acts 17
countering the dispute concerning birth from a particular area to one BLOOD,
in law a common human consanguinity which having the evidence of mixed races
or ethnicities is evidence of common humanity due therefore common equity
(dikaiosune, see Aristotle BOOK 5 NICHOMACHEAN ETHICS).  
He then established the common observation that in one theos all live and move
and have being which relates back to the first observation that they had many
gods each of which protected certain classes of rights when given obeisance.
The unknown one Theos being the god upon whom even the other gods demiurgos
we're dependent.  
Then he established the ideal judge who could advocate the natural rights of
those in the image of the invisible Theos who is not in the image or location
chosen by men but has established equity in the image of God in the god man in
whom are all actual subjective rights obvious by natural law made objective
because HE will judge in that equity, justice, righteousness, dikaiosune,
mishpat and God has given proof of this by raising him from the dead
signifying he is eternal and has the power over life and death for all in his
image.  
Paul draws this human rights argument directly from the old testament
description of messiah the Christ not Greek philosophy he has simply explained
it so that greeks could understand it. This is the same structure used in the
prologue to John's Gospel, beginning with IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE LOGOS, the
logos became flesh, that becoming flesh gave us equity and the authority to
claim the title of an inheritance of rights i.e THE SONS OF GOD, our duty
then, his law is to love and protect the legitimate rights of others as we
love and protect our own rights, knowing these rights came from God by grace
and the truth concerning the fact of the matter that is the Christ.  
I don't see how philosophy can improve on this although it may help to
understand it, but it doesn't improve upon but rather is corrected by the new
testament based on the two great commandments with respect to God's rights and
our rights in common as neighbors and the explanation in the prophets such as
ISAIAH who goes into great detail on the subject of equity of rights in the
human image of God YHVHJESUS.  
  

@Miguel  
  
That does make sense. It is true that on Europe at the saint time no one would
disagree with the idea of natural rights, not even the gnostics, i suppose.  
  
Boy, thinks have gotten worse!  
  
@Anon  
  
That is a neat thinking. Locke style arguments are a interesting theistic view
of natural law but the neighbors connection we have thanks to Our God is a
more christian basis of the view.  
  
It even reminds me of the stoics. Marcus Aurelius talked about something
similar. Of course, the hebrews started things way earlier.  
  
  
*i think that Epicurus was born a bit latter 

Do nice people go to Heaven?  
  
Let's imagine a nice Catholic. He prays, he keeps all of the ten commandments,
obeys all church directives, gives alms to the poor, and does regular
missionary activity providing Bibles and building schools in Africa. He dies
and goes to Heaven, where people admire just how nice he is. But he looks
around and sees actually good people, people with special abilities and
excellence, and he realizes how unworthy he is of Heaven, and he cannot abide
in their presence. So he exits Heaven and never returns.  
  
Now, being nice is certainly better than being evil... but it doesn't get you
much. How does one become good instead of nice?

Huh?  
  
I don't know where your conception of heaven comes from, but it's certainly
not the one the Church ascribes to. You don't go to heaven by being "good" in
any sense of the word. Nobody merits heaven because no matter how good we are,
it pales in comparison to God's goodness. You go to heaven by cooperating with
God's gift of grace in your life, with the principle way of doing that by
being, as you describe, "a nice Catholic."  
  
The principle joy of heaven is the beatific vision, which is to say the
happiness you get in heaven comes from the fact that you are in communion with
God. The scenario where you described a "nice Catholic" turning away from
heaven because they are not "good" enough just simply would not happen.

Courage. The Way by St. Jose Maria Escriva is a good daily meditation for men
looking to be tougher. They’re each one sentence long so it’s not a big time
commitment either. When someone is nice to a fault, it’s usually based in fear
and lack of confidence in what the Lord has given you. I’m going through this
same struggle right now and I’m glad to be able to share what I’ve learned.
God bless.

@Journey 516 Fr. Josémaria's _opus dei_ is very similar to the Jewish belief
of _tikkun haolam_  
  
"Judaism is not for good people, it is good for people." - Rabbi Abby Jacobson  
  
Even though I'm Catholic, my soul has greatly benefited from studying Judaism.

But Judaism isn't for "people". It's for the Jews, theoretically. At least I
haven't noticed any proselytism by this religion.

@Infinite _Growth  
  
Even the biggest saint did not merit Heaven, but that is okay, for Our Lord
offer is one were all you have to do is accept it. By accepting it you become
a temple of the Holy Spirit and so pretty much slowly start to act like a good
catholic, but it is not the good acts, it is Our Lord union with you.  
  
Someday i said how it seems like i never do anything good and how bad iam to
receive this offer, and the answer i got was "that is good, but do not focus
on that too much". What this means is that we must never forget that we do not
merit Heaven, but we also should not bother to much for it, for we can accept
the gift, it is your Judge that offers it.

@Talmid Almost nobody merits salvation... except for the Blessed Virgin Mary.  
  
 _But Judaism isn't for "people". It's for the Jews, theoretically. At least I

This is a common myth among Christians, that Judaism was some kind of clannish
horder of salvation until J-sus came and brought it to everyone. Judaism does
not, never has, and never will teach that only Jews can receive salvation.
Non-Jews can receive salvation, but they have a different set of commandments
to follow (Noachide code). And G-d asks a lot less from a non-Jew so that's
why they strongly discourage conversion.

 _But he looks around and sees actually good people, people with special
abilities and excellence, and he realizes how unworthy he is of Heaven,_  
  
In addition to the replies above, I want to focus on this notion. First,
"special abilities" **never was** any aspect of being "qualified" for heaven.
Take, for example, St. Peter. If you examine his behavior in the Gospels and
Acts, you find a guy - a mere fisherman - who constantly puts his foot in his
mouth, who berates God, and who runs away from a friend in great need.
Eventually, he did clean up his act, but - as with all the saints - he
attributed this to **favors he was granted out of God's overflowing gifts** ,
not out of his own merit.  
  
"and excelllence". Again the ONLY excellence that technically qualifies is the
**love of God** by which you act rightly in all your acts, and this is (again)
always due to God's beneficent favor, not our own merit. All we can claim is
to have _remained in cooperation_ with said grace, rather than repudiating it.
St. Francis said that greater good would be found in a man merely picking a
piece of straw out of the road, if done with perfect love of God, than in a
great many great sacrifices suffered with imperfect love.  
  
What you are confusing in "excellences" is the acts of HEROIC virtues by which
the Church _locates and confirms canonized_ saints, with the actual excellence
needed, perfect love. But the life of a nun in a contemplative cloister, who
spends her entire life _just FOLLOWING THE RULE_ with perfect charity, (and
without any call by God to endure situations demanding heroic virtue), has
just as much claim on being in heaven as some highly acclaimed saint who
performed many wonders and miracles with love of God, or a saint who bore
great visible sufferings for love of God. The Church never _expects_ to
canonize all those who go to heaven: she uses the test of heroic virtue as an
empirical source of _evidence for_ the required love of God, but she does not
deny the same love might persist in many who do not demonstrate it VISIBLY in
great events.  
  
And if you die in the state of grace but highly imperfect in your love of God,
your time in Purgatory will correct that, and you will get to heaven with
perfect love of God - just like the acclaimed and cannonized saints.

Can someone recommend a more beginner level essay on this topic? Infest this
might be too meaty and am a little wary of purchasing it

Perhaps Ed "Classical natural law theory, property rights and taxation", would
be a good reading.

Is there any other way we could have access to this essay? Because nobody is
going to pay 200 dollars for the book.

I wonder if asking for the book from your library (either as its own copy, or
through Inter Library Loan), would cause some libraries to _buy_ the book? And
if so, should we ALL go out and ask for the book from our library, to increase
demand?  
  
Or would that just prove to the publishers that they are charging a reasonable
price for the book?  
  
Without demanding an accounting of whether the publishers paid the individual
authors for their contributions (which I heavily doubt), it seems _quite
implausible_ that they are not planning on a hefty, hefty profit at that rate,
even even if you assume extremely limited sales being only to universities and
large libraries. I am not strongly inclined to participate in that kind of
racket.
