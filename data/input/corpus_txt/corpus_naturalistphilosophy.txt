I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

  *     * [ ![](https://s2.wp.com/i/logo/wpcom-gray-white.png) The Philosophy Corner ](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com)

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature: Examining the
Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books, pp.179-214.

Great post, and i have 5 questions on this  
1) What do you think about G2 is the all physical cause-effect relations are
local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?  
Gordon, Bruce L. (2010) “Inflationary Cosmology and the String Multiverse,” in
Robert J. Spitzer, S.J. New Proofs for the Existence of God: Contributions of
Contemporary Physics and Philosophy. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, pp. 75-103.

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.
_Symmetry_ , 2020; 12 (9): 1533 DOI:
[10.3390/sym12091533](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12091533)

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

1/2)some QM phenomena şike Quantum entaglement and smith’s simultaneous
causation thesis used to explain Jon-local correlations with local
correlations.  
5)there are 4 different arguments, first two are smith&grünbaum’s arguments
other two is leon’s arguments links:

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:

Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.

Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.

This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?

The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)

If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.

To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in

Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.

Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:

From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.

Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)

So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.

My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:

I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:

While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.

Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.

He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.

Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our
memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-
explained-its-how-we-check-our-memories/). _New Scientist_. 16 Aug 2016.
Web.).

“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)

Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.

Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge

Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.

This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.

Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.

If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.

Electric fields theory (EFT) of consciousness, indeed similar to panpsychism,
at least _prima facie_ , is where panpsychists should place their chips. Tam
Hunt elaborates:

Riding the Nitro at Six Flags in Jackson, NJ in the front row

Getting jumped on a school bus in the E. 161st Tunnel in the Bronx

Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.

If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.

In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.

It is standard procedure in philosophical practice to anticipate rebuttals. In

religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.

I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.

The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.

Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.

Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.

Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.

The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

> Suppose, among all of the events that happen in the universe, there are
> countless many that happen without cause or reason. If this were true, we

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

_______. (2011b) “Balloons on a String: A Critique of Multiverse Cosmology,”
in Bruce L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature:
Examining the Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books,
pp.558-601.

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

Great post, and i have 5 questions on this  
1) What do you think about G2 is the all physical cause-effect relations are
local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

_______. (2011a). “A Quantum-Theoretic Argument against Naturalism,” in Bruce
L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature: Examining the
Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books, pp.179-214.

GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)

1/2)some QM phenomena şike Quantum entaglement and smith’s simultaneous
causation thesis used to explain Jon-local correlations with local
correlations.  
5)there are 4 different arguments, first two are smith&grünbaum’s arguments
other two is leon’s arguments links:

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

    * Already have a WordPress.com account? [Log in now.](https://wordpress.com/log-in?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fnaturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com%2F2022%2F01%2F09%2Frescuing-logic-from-the-abuse-of-bayes-theorem-validity-soundness-and-probability%2F&signup_flow=account)

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.

So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.

“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)

Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.

> Experiential phenomena are _emergent_ phenomena. Consciousness properties,

> basic nature, is indeed a wholly non-conscious, non-experiential phenomenon.

Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.

Electric fields theory (EFT) of consciousness, indeed similar to panpsychism,
at least _prima facie_ , is where panpsychists should place their chips. Tam
Hunt elaborates:

This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?

Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.

From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.

Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge

Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.

Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.

Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.

Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our
memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-
explained-its-how-we-check-our-memories/). _New Scientist_. 16 Aug 2016.
Web.).

Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:

Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.

If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.

He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.

To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:

I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:

Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)

While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.

This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.

My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:

To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:

The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:

Getting jumped on a school bus in the E. 161st Tunnel in the Bronx

Petting farm animals at Kira’s World Exotics Mini Zoo in Hatillo, Puerto Rico

If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.

In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.

Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.

The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.

Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.

I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.

It is standard procedure in philosophical practice to anticipate rebuttals. In
my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.

Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.

Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

Great post, and i have 5 questions on this  
1) What do you think about G2 is the all physical cause-effect relations are
local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?  
Gordon, Bruce L. (2010) “Inflationary Cosmology and the String Multiverse,” in
Robert J. Spitzer, S.J. New Proofs for the Existence of God: Contributions of
Contemporary Physics and Philosophy. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, pp. 75-103.

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)

G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.
_Symmetry_ , 2020; 12 (9): 1533 DOI:
[10.3390/sym12091533](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12091533)

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

> countless many that happen without cause or reason. If this were true, we

> cognitive states. (425)

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature: Examining the
Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books, pp.179-214.

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)

If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.

Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our
memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-
explained-its-how-we-check-our-memories/). _New Scientist_. 16 Aug 2016.

“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)

Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.

I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:

Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.

Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.

This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?

Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.

Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.

Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.

So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.

To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:

> When a blind man is asked if he dreams the answer is immediate: ‘Yes!’ But
> if we ask him if he sees anything in the dream, the answer is always
> doubtful because he does not know what it is to see. Even if there were

The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)

Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge

While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.

This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.

My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:

He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.

If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.

From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.

Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.

To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:

Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:

Electric fields theory (EFT) of consciousness, indeed similar to panpsychism,
at least _prima facie_ , is where panpsychists should place their chips. Tam
Hunt elaborates:

The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.

If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.

Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.

It is standard procedure in philosophical practice to anticipate rebuttals. In
my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.

In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.

The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:

Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.

Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.

I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.

Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

> countless many that happen without cause or reason. If this were true, we

> that every contingent event has an explanation. (425)

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,

L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature: Examining the
Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books, pp.179-214.

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena
Modeled by Interactions between Many Classical Worlds. _Physical Review X_ ,
2014; 4 (4) DOI:
[10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013)).

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.

Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.

So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.

Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.

Electric fields theory (EFT) of consciousness, indeed similar to panpsychism,
at least _prima facie_ , is where panpsychists should place their chips. Tam
Hunt elaborates:

From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.

Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.

Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.

If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.

This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?

My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:

To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:

Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our
memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-
explained-its-how-we-check-our-memories/). _New Scientist_. 16 Aug 2016.
Web.).

The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)

While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.

This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.

Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:

Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.

I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:

    * Already have a WordPress.com account? [Log in now.](https://wordpress.com/log-in?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fnaturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com%2F2021%2F03%2F20%2Fa-reply-to-strawson-physicalism-does-not-entail-panpsychism%2F&signup_flow=account)

Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.

Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge

To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:

> they play in human-created machines, can power a wide array of processes
> essential to life. Perhaps even consciousness itself. A veritable army of

“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)

He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.

If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.

Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.

In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.

Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.

The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.

Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.

I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.

If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.

It is standard procedure in philosophical practice to anticipate rebuttals. In
my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.

Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.

The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

_______. (2011a). “A Quantum-Theoretic Argument against Naturalism,” in Bruce
L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature: Examining the
Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books, pp.179-214.

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

1/2)some QM phenomena şike Quantum entaglement and smith’s simultaneous
causation thesis used to explain Jon-local correlations with local
correlations.  
5)there are 4 different arguments, first two are smith&grünbaum’s arguments
other two is leon’s arguments links:

> Copenhagen orthodoxy, framed in a purely physical context, entails a denial

> that every contingent event has an explanation. (425)

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.
_Symmetry_ , 2020; 12 (9): 1533 DOI:
[10.3390/sym12091533](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12091533)

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena
Modeled by Interactions between Many Classical Worlds. _Physical Review X_ ,
2014; 4 (4) DOI:
[10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013)).

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)

> Suppose, among all of the events that happen in the universe, there are
> countless many that happen without cause or reason. If this were true, we
> would have no principled way of telling which events were caused and which
> were not, for events that _appeared_ to have a cause might, in fact, lack
> one. Our current perceptual states, for example, might have no explanation,
> in which case they would bear no reliable connection to the way the world

> cognitive states. (425)

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

_______. (2013a) “In Defense of Uniformitarianism,” Perspectives on Science
and the Christian Faith, vol. 65, no. 2, pp.79-86.  
4) What do you think about whole of “TWO DOZEN” book  
5) What do you think about Leon and Smith’s QM-based arguments for atheism

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

1/2)some QM phenomena şike Quantum entaglement and smith’s simultaneous
causation thesis used to explain Jon-local correlations with local
correlations.  
5)there are 4 different arguments, first two are smith&grünbaum’s arguments
other two is leon’s arguments links:

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena
Modeled by Interactions between Many Classical Worlds. _Physical Review X_ ,
2014; 4 (4) DOI:
[10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013)).

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

Great post, and i have 5 questions on this  
1) What do you think about G2 is the all physical cause-effect relations are
local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?  
Gordon, Bruce L. (2010) “Inflationary Cosmology and the String Multiverse,” in
Robert J. Spitzer, S.J. New Proofs for the Existence of God: Contributions of
Contemporary Physics and Philosophy. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, pp. 75-103.

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

    * Already have a WordPress.com account? [Log in now.](https://wordpress.com/log-in?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fnaturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com%2F2022%2F01%2F09%2Frescuing-logic-from-the-abuse-of-bayes-theorem-validity-soundness-and-probability%2F&signup_flow=account)

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.

My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:

From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.

Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge

Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.

If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.

“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)

To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:

This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.

He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.

Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.

> Nevertheless when parts of it combine in certain ways, experiential

> experiential phenomena. Nevertheless, when they combine in certain ways,
> experiential phenomena ‘emerge’. (12)

So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.

Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)

If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.

Electric fields theory (EFT) of consciousness, indeed similar to panpsychism,
at least _prima facie_ , is where panpsychists should place their chips. Tam

Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.

Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.

Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:

I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:

The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)

While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.

Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our
memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-
explained-its-how-we-check-our-memories/). _New Scientist_. 16 Aug 2016.
Web.).

Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.

This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?

Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.

In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.

The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:

    * Already have a WordPress.com account? [Log in now.](https://wordpress.com/log-in?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fnaturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com%2F2021%2F10%2F10%2Fwhy-reincarnation-is-incompatible-with-naturalism%2F&signup_flow=account)

Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.

Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.

Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.

It is standard procedure in philosophical practice to anticipate rebuttals. In
my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.

I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.

Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.

If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.

The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.
_Symmetry_ , 2020; 12 (9): 1533 DOI:
[10.3390/sym12091533](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12091533)

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

Great post, and i have 5 questions on this  
1) What do you think about G2 is the all physical cause-effect relations are
local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

4) What do you think about whole of “TWO DOZEN” book  
5) What do you think about Leon and Smith’s QM-based arguments for atheism

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,

1/2)some QM phenomena şike Quantum entaglement and smith’s simultaneous
causation thesis used to explain Jon-local correlations with local
correlations.  
5)there are 4 different arguments, first two are smith&grünbaum’s arguments
other two is leon’s arguments links:

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

> Now, in quantum physics we are confronted with a situation in which material
> causality falls irremediably short of explanatory demand, for there is no
> collection of physical variables jointly sufficient to the explanation of

> that every contingent event has an explanation. (425)

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

_______. (2011a). “A Quantum-Theoretic Argument against Naturalism,” in Bruce
L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature: Examining the
Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books, pp.179-214.

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena

2014; 4 (4) DOI:

in Bruce L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature:

pp.558-601.

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,

GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)

1/2)some QM phenomena şike Quantum entaglement and smith’s simultaneous
causation thesis used to explain Jon-local correlations with local
correlations.  
5)there are 4 different arguments, first two are smith&grünbaum’s arguments
other two is leon’s arguments links:

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

Great post, and i have 5 questions on this  
1) What do you think about G2 is the all physical cause-effect relations are
local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.

Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:

Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.

I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:

To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:

Electric fields theory (EFT) of consciousness, indeed similar to panpsychism,
at least _prima facie_ , is where panpsychists should place their chips. Tam
Hunt elaborates:

> Dreams?”](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/dream-factory/201712/do-
> blind-people-see-in-their-dreams). _Psychology Today_. 29 Dec 2017. Web.

Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.

Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.

This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms

So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.

While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.

Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.

Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)

He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.

Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge

Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.

This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?

From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.

To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:

My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:

If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.

Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.

“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)

If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.

The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)

Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our
memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-
explained-its-how-we-check-our-memories/). _New Scientist_. 16 Aug 2016.
Web.).

Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.

Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.

The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:

It is standard procedure in philosophical practice to anticipate rebuttals. In
my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.

In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.

The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.

If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.

Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.

Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.

I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena
Modeled by Interactions between Many Classical Worlds. _Physical Review X_ ,
2014; 4 (4) DOI:
[10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013)).

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

4) What do you think about whole of “TWO DOZEN” book  
5) What do you think about Leon and Smith’s QM-based arguments for atheism

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer

issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.

Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)

From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.

“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)

This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?

While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.

So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.

Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.

This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.

Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.

To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:

Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge

Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our

Electric fields theory (EFT) of consciousness, indeed similar to panpsychism,
at least _prima facie_ , is where panpsychists should place their chips. Tam
Hunt elaborates:

To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:

Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.

Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.

My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:

Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.

The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)

Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.

Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:

I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:

If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.

If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.

He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.

Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.

The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:

If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.

Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.

In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.

It is standard procedure in philosophical practice to anticipate rebuttals. In
my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.

The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.

I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.

Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.

Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

  *     * [ ![](https://s2.wp.com/i/logo/wpcom-gray-white.png) The Philosophy Corner ](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com)

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

1/2)some QM phenomena şike Quantum entaglement and smith’s simultaneous
causation thesis used to explain Jon-local correlations with local
correlations.  
5)there are 4 different arguments, first two are smith&grünbaum’s arguments
other two is leon’s arguments links:

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

Great post, and i have 5 questions on this  
1) What do you think about G2 is the all physical cause-effect relations are
local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?

Robert J. Spitzer, S.J. New Proofs for the Existence of God: Contributions of
Contemporary Physics and Philosophy. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, pp. 75-103.

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium

_______. (2011b) “Balloons on a String: A Critique of Multiverse Cosmology,”
in Bruce L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature:
Examining the Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books,
pp.558-601.

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena
Modeled by Interactions between Many Classical Worlds. _Physical Review X_ ,
2014; 4 (4) DOI:
[10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013)).

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

and the Christian Faith, vol. 65, no. 2, pp.79-86.  
4) What do you think about whole of “TWO DOZEN” book  
5) What do you think about Leon and Smith’s QM-based arguments for atheism

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

_______. (2011a). “A Quantum-Theoretic Argument against Naturalism,” in Bruce
L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature: Examining the
Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books, pp.179-214.

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.

Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.

Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.

Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.

From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.

“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)

Electric fields theory (EFT) of consciousness, indeed similar to panpsychism,
at least _prima facie_ , is where panpsychists should place their chips. Tam
Hunt elaborates:

Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.

So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.

If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.

The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)

Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.

While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.

He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.

Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)

Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge

Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:

To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:

This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?

Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our
memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-
explained-its-how-we-check-our-memories/). _New Scientist_. 16 Aug 2016.
Web.).

This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.

I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:

My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:

To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:

If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.

Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.

I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.

The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.

Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.

Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.

In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.

The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:

Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.

Bronx

Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.

If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.

It is standard procedure in philosophical practice to anticipate rebuttals. In
my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

_______. (2011a). “A Quantum-Theoretic Argument against Naturalism,” in Bruce
L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature: Examining the
Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books, pp.179-214.

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

1/2)some QM phenomena şike Quantum entaglement and smith’s simultaneous
causation thesis used to explain Jon-local correlations with local
correlations.  
5)there are 4 different arguments, first two are smith&grünbaum’s arguments
other two is leon’s arguments links:

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

    * Already have a WordPress.com account? [Log in now.](https://wordpress.com/log-in?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fnaturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com%2F2021%2F02%2F01%2Fa-refutation-of-bruce-gordons-argument-from-the-incompleteness-of-nature%2F&signup_flow=account)

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

    * Already have a WordPress.com account? [Log in now.](https://wordpress.com/log-in?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fnaturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com%2F2022%2F01%2F09%2Frescuing-logic-from-the-abuse-of-bayes-theorem-validity-soundness-and-probability%2F&signup_flow=account)

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.

Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.

Electric fields theory (EFT) of consciousness, indeed similar to panpsychism,
at least _prima facie_ , is where panpsychists should place their chips. Tam
Hunt elaborates:

The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)

From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.

Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.

Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.

To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:

“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)

Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.

This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?

Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.

Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our
memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-

Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.

Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge

My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:

Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:

If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.

So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.

I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:

To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:

Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)

Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.

This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.

If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.

He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.

Getting jumped on a school bus in the E. 161st Tunnel in the Bronx

Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.

Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.

The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.

The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:

If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.

It is standard procedure in philosophical practice to anticipate rebuttals. In
my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.

I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.

Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.

Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.

In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

pp.558-601.

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

1/2)some QM phenomena şike Quantum entaglement and smith’s simultaneous
causation thesis used to explain Jon-local correlations with local
correlations.  
5)there are 4 different arguments, first two are smith&grünbaum’s arguments
other two is leon’s arguments links:

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

_______. (2013a) “In Defense of Uniformitarianism,” Perspectives on Science
and the Christian Faith, vol. 65, no. 2, pp.79-86.  
4) What do you think about whole of “TWO DOZEN” book  
5) What do you think about Leon and Smith’s QM-based arguments for atheism

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

    * Already have a WordPress.com account? [Log in now.](https://wordpress.com/log-in?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fnaturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com%2F2021%2F02%2F01%2Fa-refutation-of-bruce-gordons-argument-from-the-incompleteness-of-nature%2F&signup_flow=account)

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena
Modeled by Interactions between Many Classical Worlds. _Physical Review X_ ,
2014; 4 (4) DOI:
[10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013)).

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

Great post, and i have 5 questions on this  
1) What do you think about G2 is the all physical cause-effect relations are
local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?  
Gordon, Bruce L. (2010) “Inflationary Cosmology and the String Multiverse,” in
Robert J. Spitzer, S.J. New Proofs for the Existence of God: Contributions of
Contemporary Physics and Philosophy. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, pp. 75-103.

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

  *     * [ ![](https://s2.wp.com/i/logo/wpcom-gray-white.png) The Philosophy Corner ](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com)

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

_______. (2011a). “A Quantum-Theoretic Argument against Naturalism,” in Bruce
L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature: Examining the
Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books, pp.179-214.

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena
Modeled by Interactions between Many Classical Worlds. _Physical Review X_ ,
2014; 4 (4) DOI:
[10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013)).

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.
_Symmetry_ , 2020; 12 (9): 1533 DOI:
[10.3390/sym12091533](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12091533)

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

_______. (2011b) “Balloons on a String: A Critique of Multiverse Cosmology,”
in Bruce L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature:
Examining the Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books,
pp.558-601.

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

Great post, and i have 5 questions on this  
1) What do you think about G2 is the all physical cause-effect relations are
local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?  
Gordon, Bruce L. (2010) “Inflationary Cosmology and the String Multiverse,” in
Robert J. Spitzer, S.J. New Proofs for the Existence of God: Contributions of
Contemporary Physics and Philosophy. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, pp. 75-103.

_______. (2013a) “In Defense of Uniformitarianism,” Perspectives on Science
and the Christian Faith, vol. 65, no. 2, pp.79-86.  
4) What do you think about whole of “TWO DOZEN” book  
5) What do you think about Leon and Smith’s QM-based arguments for atheism

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena
Modeled by Interactions between Many Classical Worlds. _Physical Review X_ ,
2014; 4 (4) DOI:
[10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013)).

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

1/2)some QM phenomena şike Quantum entaglement and smith’s simultaneous
causation thesis used to explain Jon-local correlations with local
correlations.  
5)there are 4 different arguments, first two are smith&grünbaum’s arguments
other two is leon’s arguments links:

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

Great post, and i have 5 questions on this  
1) What do you think about G2 is the all physical cause-effect relations are
local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?  
Gordon, Bruce L. (2010) “Inflationary Cosmology and the String Multiverse,” in
Robert J. Spitzer, S.J. New Proofs for the Existence of God: Contributions of
Contemporary Physics and Philosophy. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, pp. 75-103.

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

and the Christian Faith, vol. 65, no. 2, pp.79-86.  
4) What do you think about whole of “TWO DOZEN” book  
5) What do you think about Leon and Smith’s QM-based arguments for atheism

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:

While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.

To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:

This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.

From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.

My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:

If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.

Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge

The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)

Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:

Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.

Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.

Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)

So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.

If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.

This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?

Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.

Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.

Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.

“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)

Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our
memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-
explained-its-how-we-check-our-memories/). _New Scientist_. 16 Aug 2016.
Web.).

Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.

To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:

He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.

Electric fields theory (EFT) of consciousness, indeed similar to panpsychism,
at least _prima facie_ , is where panpsychists should place their chips. Tam
Hunt elaborates:

Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.

I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.

Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.

Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.

It is standard procedure in philosophical practice to anticipate rebuttals. In
my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.

Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.

The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.

Petting farm animals at Kira’s World Exotics Mini Zoo in Hatillo, Puerto Rico

Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.

Getting jumped on a school bus in the E. 161st Tunnel in the Bronx

In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.

If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.

The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:

  1. October 10, 2021 - 2:18 pm Pingback: [Why Reincarnation is Incompatible With Naturalism | The Philosophy Corner](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/10/10/why-reincarnation-is-incompatible-with-naturalism/)

Firstly, I want to begin from the finitude of brain states, an extension from
the limits of phenomenal experience. I do not disagree that there is
accompanying phenomenal experience for any interaction between an object and
our senses. I do disagree that what it is like for me to smell roses is
peculiar and markedly different from your experience of smelling a rose. I
happen to think our experiences are roughly equal. Whether you or I like the
smell of roses or not involves more than just the phenomenal experience. In
other words, there’s a lot of background noise that explains why you like the
smell more than I do. Perhaps I associate the smell of roses with wakes and
funerals rather than with candlelit dinners and weddings. The noise is not
what I want to focus on.

When one normally thinks of reincarnation, one has in mind a caricature, the
spirit of a Jane Doe coming to inhabit a frog, unbeknownst to anyone, but
arguably Jane Doe herself. This, however, is an oversimplification. While
reincarnation is often considered an idea lauded by Eastern mystics, modern
day science can be marshaled in to lend support to the idea of reincarnation,
though in ways completely unexpected. For instance, one would usually hear the
usual tripe: since matter and energy cannot be created nor destroyed, one’s
consciousness must live on after death. The argument I want to offer is more
intricate.

Buddhists have long struggled to reconcile the idea of reincarnation with
_anattā_ , but a resolution isn’t difficult to come by. Before offering a
solution, I defer to Wildman:

This, in fact, falls on the horns of a dilemma Buddhists have. Recall,
Buddhists hold to the concept of _anattā_ (no self). While I may have thrown
around the word ‘identity’, this need not imply that I believe identity to be
_real_ and _substantive_. In fact, I think it is entirely illusory and that if
we interact with enough people, we will find that we have more in common than
we would like to admit. Some of us have delusions of grandeur; we have god and
savior complexes, see ourselves as fixers, and believe that there is no
problem we cannot solve. Others choose to mind their business, to not take on
a deep personal investment in the struggles even loved ones go through, and
instead choose to let the people around us work through their own problems. In
one way or another, it is likely that my two brief sketches of identity
resonate with my readers. Either you are one who suffers from delusions of
grandeur and you base even your romantic relationships on this futile attempt
to save everyone. Or, you are someone who has no deep personal investment in
the problems even the people closest to you have; this isn’t to say you refuse
to help when asked, but you prefer to let people find their own way. If one of
the two people I have described describes aspects of you, then you are further
to committing to the premise that mental states are finite and that therefore,
identities are limited.

Perhaps not in the next generation of life, or even in the next ten
generations, but at some point, a sentient being will be born who believes,
perhaps mistakenly, that they are me. To believe this, you need only believe
that mental states, whether tied to a brain, or to intricate nervous systems,
are finite. If such states are finite and the combination of such states and
functions are finite, then there are only so many identities to go around.
Given a long enough time, someone will come along and believe that they are
exactly who Napoleon thought he was.

Instead, I would like to focus on mental states themselves and argue that
though there are potentially innumerable brain states, they are finite. Even
if we capture every brain state of every organism in the universe, and include
also the correlate states of organisms that are conscious though lacking a
brain, the total number of mental states do not stretch infinitely.
Furthermore, the combinations of brain states, right down to the size and
function of my brain or your brain, in particular, are finite. To put it
another way, let us say that there is a limitation in the communication
between one’s prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. This may result in autism or
schizophrenia (Watson, Thomas C et al. “Back to front: cerebellar connections
and interactions with the prefrontal cortex.” _Frontiers in systems
neuroscience_ vol. 8 4. 4 Feb. 2014, doi:10.3389/fnsys.2014.00004). With these
particular disorders, there are a number of hallmark behavioral traits. This
gives some credence to the idea that brain states are fundamentally finite and
do not, as it were, stretch on forever.

My resolution is that while there is no self, no concrete identity, what
persists are the illusions of a self or an identity brought about by the
limited combinations of mental states humans experience. This is why so many
of us come to have exactly the same ideas about ourselves, despite the fact
that we are different people with vastly different past experiences. This is
why mental and cognitive disorders feature an array of hallmark symptoms. To
illustrate this even better, think of the way genes encode phenotypic
features. Straight thumbs, for instance, are expressed with a capital S
whereas hitchhiker thumbs are recessive alleles expressed with a lowercase s.
This peculiarity, assuming you have it, does not belong to you. There are
other people who have hitchhiker thumb and they have it because gene
expression in their genomes have resulted in this phenotypic feature.
Likewise, our mental states, the manner in which brain regions communicate
with one another, and the way in which our particular neurons fire in our
brains create the same illusions of a static identity, packaged with a linear
life narrative that we can literally draw a straight line through from our
first memories in childhood through today.

Unfortunately, we are no longer so taken by behaviorists and know that human
beings are a lot more than simply a finite set of behaviors. We have our
preferences, things we are repulsed by, idiosyncrasies, and personalities to
speak of. Even then, I think that the combination of traits that make you
_you_ , no matter how multifarious, are finite. This implies that given a long
enough time, some sentient being, whether homo sapien or something very
similar to our own species, will come to believe in the same _you_ you believe
you are. This, to my mind, is how naturalism makes room for reincarnation.

There is no substantive self that persists, a soul as it were. There is,
however, a persistent illusion in all of us and I do not put it passed a being
eons from now to think that s/he is exactly who I think I am. Furthermore, I
do not discount the idea that s/he will _feel_ , phenomenologically speaking,
exactly as I do. There is this sense that _I am_. Whether or not identity is
real, the illusion is powerful enough to lead me to believe I am unique and
that there will never be another exactly like me. This is folly. So while
there is no substantive soul in me or in my cat, there are a number of mental
states, resulting from brain and nerve interactions, that make both of us
_feel_ like we are a unique individuals never to be replicated. I conclude
that it is far likelier that since there are not infinite mental states to go
around, there are not infinite illusions to go around either. What we refer to
as the soul or identity has its boundaries and limits. There will be another
_you_ , so in that sense, even after death, should the universe persist, _you_
will live again with no recollection of the _you_ you are right now.

This may seem particularly discomforting for some readers. For others, they
may think that this idea is not developed enough. I admit, the argument is
very bare bones and could use more flesh. That, however, does not mean the
argument is unsound. I happen to be convinced, first and foremost, that mental
states and what we call identities do not stretch to infinity and that
therefore, there are only so many _yous_ to go around. As such, _you_ will
live again or be reborn. This is how naturalism makes room for something as
mystical as reincarnation. The lesson is that naturalists should shun the
habit of dismissing an idea because it is religious or _prima facie_
supernatural. There might be a kernel of truth to the idea of reincarnation.
That remains to be seen, but my argument is certainly a good place to start.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

  *     * [ ![](https://s2.wp.com/i/logo/wpcom-gray-white.png) The Philosophy Corner ](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com)

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature: Examining the
Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books, pp.179-214.

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

Great post, and i have 5 questions on this  
1) What do you think about G2 is the all physical cause-effect relations are
local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?

Robert J. Spitzer, S.J. New Proofs for the Existence of God: Contributions of

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

_______. (2013a) “In Defense of Uniformitarianism,” Perspectives on Science
and the Christian Faith, vol. 65, no. 2, pp.79-86.  
4) What do you think about whole of “TWO DOZEN” book  
5) What do you think about Leon and Smith’s QM-based arguments for atheism

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena
Modeled by Interactions between Many Classical Worlds. _Physical Review X_ ,
2014; 4 (4) DOI:
[10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013)).

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

1/2)some QM phenomena şike Quantum entaglement and smith’s simultaneous
causation thesis used to explain Jon-local correlations with local
correlations.  
5)there are 4 different arguments, first two are smith&grünbaum’s arguments
other two is leon’s arguments links:

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.
_Symmetry_ , 2020; 12 (9): 1533 DOI:
[10.3390/sym12091533](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12091533)

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books, pp.179-214.

GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty

and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for

of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s

persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that

we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical

David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics

4) What do you think about whole of “TWO DOZEN” book  
5) What do you think about Leon and Smith’s QM-based arguments for atheism

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

Great post, and i have 5 questions on this  
1) What do you think about G2 is the all physical cause-effect relations are
local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?  
Gordon, Bruce L. (2010) “Inflationary Cosmology and the String Multiverse,” in
Robert J. Spitzer, S.J. New Proofs for the Existence of God: Contributions of
Contemporary Physics and Philosophy. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, pp. 75-103.

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.
_Symmetry_ , 2020; 12 (9): 1533 DOI:
[10.3390/sym12091533](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12091533)

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

  *     * [ ![](https://s2.wp.com/i/logo/wpcom-gray-white.png) The Philosophy Corner ](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com)

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena
Modeled by Interactions between Many Classical Worlds. _Physical Review X_ ,
2014; 4 (4) DOI:
[10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013)).

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

_______. (2011b) “Balloons on a String: A Critique of Multiverse Cosmology,”
in Bruce L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature:
Examining the Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books,
pp.558-601.

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.
_Symmetry_ , 2020; 12 (9): 1533 DOI:
[10.3390/sym12091533](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12091533)

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

1/2)some QM phenomena şike Quantum entaglement and smith’s simultaneous
causation thesis used to explain Jon-local correlations with local
correlations.  
5)there are 4 different arguments, first two are smith&grünbaum’s arguments
other two is leon’s arguments links:

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

Great post, and i have 5 questions on this  
1) What do you think about G2 is the all physical cause-effect relations are
local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?  
Gordon, Bruce L. (2010) “Inflationary Cosmology and the String Multiverse,” in
Robert J. Spitzer, S.J. New Proofs for the Existence of God: Contributions of
Contemporary Physics and Philosophy. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, pp. 75-103.

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

Electric fields theory (EFT) of consciousness, indeed similar to panpsychism,
at least _prima facie_ , is where panpsychists should place their chips. Tam
Hunt elaborates:

This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.

While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.

Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:

If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.

If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.

Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.

Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.

Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.

From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.

“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)

I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:

> Take a hundred of them [feelings], shuffle them and pack them as close
> together as you can (whatever that may mean); still each remains the same
> feeling it always was, shut in its own skin, windowless, ignorant of what
> the other feelings are and mean. There would be a hundred-and first-feeling

Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.

So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.

My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:

The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)

This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?

To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:

Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.

Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.

He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.

Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge

Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.

Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our
memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-
explained-its-how-we-check-our-memories/). _New Scientist_. 16 Aug 2016.
Web.).

To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:

Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)

If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.

Getting jumped on a school bus in the E. 161st Tunnel in the Bronx

In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.

Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.

It is standard procedure in philosophical practice to anticipate rebuttals. In
my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.

Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.

I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.

Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.

The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.

Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.

The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

1/2)some QM phenomena şike Quantum entaglement and smith’s simultaneous
causation thesis used to explain Jon-local correlations with local
correlations.  
5)there are 4 different arguments, first two are smith&grünbaum’s arguments

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena
Modeled by Interactions between Many Classical Worlds. _Physical Review X_ ,
2014; 4 (4) DOI:

GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

5) What do you think about Leon and Smith’s QM-based arguments for atheism

incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.
_Symmetry_ , 2020; 12 (9): 1533 DOI:
[10.3390/sym12091533](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12091533)

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

Great post, and i have 5 questions on this  
1) What do you think about G2 is the all physical cause-effect relations are
local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?  
Gordon, Bruce L. (2010) “Inflationary Cosmology and the String Multiverse,” in
Robert J. Spitzer, S.J. New Proofs for the Existence of God: Contributions of
Contemporary Physics and Philosophy. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, pp. 75-103.

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.

“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)

My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:

If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.

Electric fields theory (EFT) of consciousness, indeed similar to panpsychism,
at least _prima facie_ , is where panpsychists should place their chips. Tam
Hunt elaborates:

Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.

This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?

Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.

Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:

So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.

Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our
memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-
explained-its-how-we-check-our-memories/). _New Scientist_. 16 Aug 2016.
Web.).

The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)

Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.

From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.

This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.

Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.

To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:

While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.

Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.

To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:

Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)

Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge

Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.

He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.

I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:

> Experiential phenomena are _emergent_ phenomena. Consciousness properties,
> experience properties, are emergent properties of wholly and utterly non-
> conscious, non-experiential phenomena. Physical stuff _in itself_ , in its
> basic nature, is indeed a wholly non-conscious, non-experiential phenomenon.
> Nevertheless when parts of it combine in certain ways, experiential
> phenomena ‘emerge’. Ultimates in themselves are wholly non-conscious, non-
> experiential phenomena. Nevertheless, when they combine in certain ways,
> experiential phenomena ‘emerge’. (12)

If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.

The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.

Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.

Fasting for three days straight in a church in the Highbridge section of the
Bronx

If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.

Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.

I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.

Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.

In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.

It is standard procedure in philosophical practice to anticipate rebuttals. In
my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.

Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.

The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

> We might sum up the objection thus: wave-function realism requires a meta-

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

_______. (2013a) “In Defense of Uniformitarianism,” Perspectives on Science
and the Christian Faith, vol. 65, no. 2, pp.79-86.  
4) What do you think about whole of “TWO DOZEN” book  
5) What do you think about Leon and Smith’s QM-based arguments for atheism

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena
Modeled by Interactions between Many Classical Worlds. _Physical Review X_ ,
2014; 4 (4) DOI:
[10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013)).

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

_______. (2011a). “A Quantum-Theoretic Argument against Naturalism,” in Bruce
L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature: Examining the
Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books, pp.179-214.

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

_______. (2011b) “Balloons on a String: A Critique of Multiverse Cosmology,”
in Bruce L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature:
Examining the Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books,
pp.558-601.

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

Great post, and i have 5 questions on this  
1) What do you think about G2 is the all physical cause-effect relations are
local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?  
Gordon, Bruce L. (2010) “Inflationary Cosmology and the String Multiverse,” in
Robert J. Spitzer, S.J. New Proofs for the Existence of God: Contributions of
Contemporary Physics and Philosophy. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, pp. 75-103.

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.

Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge

Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.

He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.

Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:

Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.

Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)

Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.

To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:

Electric fields theory (EFT) of consciousness, indeed similar to panpsychism,
at least _prima facie_ , is where panpsychists should place their chips. Tam
Hunt elaborates:

The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)

Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.

So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.

“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)

Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.

While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.

From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.

If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.

If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.

Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery

I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:

My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:

Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.

To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:

This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.

This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?

The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:

Riding the Nitro at Six Flags in Jackson, NJ in the front row

In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.

Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.

If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.

The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.

Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.

Fasting for three days straight in a church in the Highbridge section of the
Bronx

I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.

Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.

It is standard procedure in philosophical practice to anticipate rebuttals. In
my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.

Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.

“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

  *     * [ ![](https://s2.wp.com/i/logo/wpcom-gray-white.png) The Philosophy Corner ](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com)

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of

Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

1/2)some QM phenomena şike Quantum entaglement and smith’s simultaneous
causation thesis used to explain Jon-local correlations with local
correlations.  
5)there are 4 different arguments, first two are smith&grünbaum’s arguments
other two is leon’s arguments links:

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena
Modeled by Interactions between Many Classical Worlds. _Physical Review X_ ,
2014; 4 (4) DOI:
[10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.4.041013)).

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.
_Symmetry_ , 2020; 12 (9): 1533 DOI:
[10.3390/sym12091533](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12091533)

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

5) What do you think about Leon and Smith’s QM-based arguments for atheism

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

Great post, and i have 5 questions on this  
1) What do you think about G2 is the all physical cause-effect relations are
local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?  
Gordon, Bruce L. (2010) “Inflationary Cosmology and the String Multiverse,” in
Robert J. Spitzer, S.J. New Proofs for the Existence of God: Contributions of
Contemporary Physics and Philosophy. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, pp. 75-103.

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?

Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:

He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.

“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)

Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)

Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.

From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.

> Experiential phenomena are _emergent_ phenomena. Consciousness properties,
> experience properties, are emergent properties of wholly and utterly non-
> conscious, non-experiential phenomena. Physical stuff _in itself_ , in its
> basic nature, is indeed a wholly non-conscious, non-experiential phenomenon.
> Nevertheless when parts of it combine in certain ways, experiential
> phenomena ‘emerge’. Ultimates in themselves are wholly non-conscious, non-
> experiential phenomena. Nevertheless, when they combine in certain ways,
> experiential phenomena ‘emerge’. (12)

Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.

The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)

If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.

Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our
memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-
explained-its-how-we-check-our-memories/). _New Scientist_. 16 Aug 2016.
Web.).

Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.

While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.

Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.

Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.

So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.

Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge

I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:

To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:

Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.

Electric fields theory (EFT) of consciousness, indeed similar to panpsychism,
at least _prima facie_ , is where panpsychists should place their chips. Tam
Hunt elaborates:

If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.

This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.

To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:

My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:

> When a blind man is asked if he dreams the answer is immediate: ‘Yes!’ But
> if we ask him if he sees anything in the dream, the answer is always
> doubtful because he does not know what it is to see. Even if there were
> images and colours in his brain during the dream, how could he recognize
> them? There is, therefore, no direct way, through the dream reports, to
> evaluate the presence of visual activation in the dream of congenitally
> blind subjects.
>
> Carr, Michelle. [“Do Blind People See in Their
> Dreams?”](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/dream-factory/201712/do-
> blind-people-see-in-their-dreams). _Psychology Today_. 29 Dec 2017. Web.

Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.

I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.

The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.

The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:

Riding the Nitro at Six Flags in Jackson, NJ in the front row

In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.

If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.

Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.

Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.

Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.

It is standard procedure in philosophical practice to anticipate rebuttals. In
my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.

Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

_______. (2013a) “In Defense of Uniformitarianism,” Perspectives on Science
and the Christian Faith, vol. 65, no. 2, pp.79-86.  
4) What do you think about whole of “TWO DOZEN” book  
5) What do you think about Leon and Smith’s QM-based arguments for atheism

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,
Michael J. W., Deckert, Dirk-André, and Wiseman, Howard M.. Quantum Phenomena
Modeled by Interactions between Many Classical Worlds. _Physical Review X_ ,

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

5) What is the title Leon and Smith’s paper? It sounds interesting, even
though the same applies in the other direction. At least, on atheism, hyper
academic arguments like that aren’t necessary to ground the proposition, god
does not exist.

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

_______. (2011b) “Balloons on a String: A Critique of Multiverse Cosmology,”
in Bruce L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature:
Examining the Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books,
pp.558-601.

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.
_Symmetry_ , 2020; 12 (9): 1533 DOI:
[10.3390/sym12091533](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12091533)

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

_______. (2011a). “A Quantum-Theoretic Argument against Naturalism,” in Bruce
L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature: Examining the
Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books, pp.179-214.

1/2)some QM phenomena şike Quantum entaglement and smith’s simultaneous
causation thesis used to explain Jon-local correlations with local
correlations.  
5)there are 4 different arguments, first two are smith&grünbaum’s arguments
other two is leon’s arguments links:

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

Great post, and i have 5 questions on this  
1) What do you think about G2 is the all physical cause-effect relations are
local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?  
Gordon, Bruce L. (2010) “Inflationary Cosmology and the String Multiverse,” in
Robert J. Spitzer, S.J. New Proofs for the Existence of God: Contributions of
Contemporary Physics and Philosophy. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, pp. 75-103.

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

Electric fields theory (EFT) of consciousness, indeed similar to panpsychism,
at least _prima facie_ , is where panpsychists should place their chips. Tam

Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.

My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were
born blind cannot see while dreaming:

This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.

Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.

This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?

While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.

The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)

He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.

I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:

From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.

Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge

So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.

Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.

If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.

If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.

Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.

Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:

> Experiential phenomena are _emergent_ phenomena. Consciousness properties,
> experience properties, are emergent properties of wholly and utterly non-
> conscious, non-experiential phenomena. Physical stuff _in itself_ , in its
> basic nature, is indeed a wholly non-conscious, non-experiential phenomenon.
> Nevertheless when parts of it combine in certain ways, experiential
> phenomena ‘emerge’. Ultimates in themselves are wholly non-conscious, non-
> experiential phenomena. Nevertheless, when they combine in certain ways,
> experiential phenomena ‘emerge’. (12)

Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.

Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.

Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why
Physicalism Entails
Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.

To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:

Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our
memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-
explained-its-how-we-check-our-memories/). _New Scientist_. 16 Aug 2016.
Web.).

To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:

The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.

Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.

In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.

If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.

Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.

The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:

Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.

It is standard procedure in philosophical practice to anticipate rebuttals. In
my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.

Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.

I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.

My resolution is that while there is no self, no concrete identity, what
persists are the illusions of a self or an identity brought about by the
limited combinations of mental states humans experience. This is why so many
of us come to have exactly the same ideas about ourselves, despite the fact
that we are different people with vastly different past experiences. This is
why mental and cognitive disorders feature an array of hallmark symptoms. To
illustrate this even better, think of the way genes encode phenotypic
features. Straight thumbs, for instance, are expressed with a capital S
whereas hitchhiker thumbs are recessive alleles expressed with a lowercase s.
This peculiarity, assuming you have it, does not belong to you. There are
other people who have hitchhiker thumb and they have it because gene
expression in their genomes have resulted in this phenotypic feature.
Likewise, our mental states, the manner in which brain regions communicate
with one another, and the way in which our particular neurons fire in our
brains create the same illusions of a static identity, packaged with a linear
life narrative that we can literally draw a straight line through from our
first memories in childhood through today.

When one normally thinks of reincarnation, one has in mind a caricature, the
spirit of a Jane Doe coming to inhabit a frog, unbeknownst to anyone, but
arguably Jane Doe herself. This, however, is an oversimplification. While
reincarnation is often considered an idea lauded by Eastern mystics, modern
day science can be marshaled in to lend support to the idea of reincarnation,
though in ways completely unexpected. For instance, one would usually hear the
usual tripe: since matter and energy cannot be created nor destroyed, one’s
consciousness must live on after death. The argument I want to offer is more
intricate.

Instead, I would like to focus on mental states themselves and argue that
though there are potentially innumerable brain states, they are finite. Even
if we capture every brain state of every organism in the universe, and include
also the correlate states of organisms that are conscious though lacking a
brain, the total number of mental states do not stretch infinitely.
Furthermore, the combinations of brain states, right down to the size and
function of my brain or your brain, in particular, are finite. To put it
another way, let us say that there is a limitation in the communication
between one’s prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. This may result in autism or
schizophrenia (Watson, Thomas C et al. “Back to front: cerebellar connections
and interactions with the prefrontal cortex.” _Frontiers in systems
neuroscience_ vol. 8 4. 4 Feb. 2014, doi:10.3389/fnsys.2014.00004). With these
particular disorders, there are a number of hallmark behavioral traits. This
gives some credence to the idea that brain states are fundamentally finite and
do not, as it were, stretch on forever.

Perhaps not in the next generation of life, or even in the next ten
generations, but at some point, a sentient being will be born who believes,
perhaps mistakenly, that they are me. To believe this, you need only believe
that mental states, whether tied to a brain, or to intricate nervous systems,
are finite. If such states are finite and the combination of such states and
functions are finite, then there are only so many identities to go around.
Given a long enough time, someone will come along and believe that they are
exactly who Napoleon thought he was.

Firstly, I want to begin from the finitude of brain states, an extension from
the limits of phenomenal experience. I do not disagree that there is
accompanying phenomenal experience for any interaction between an object and
our senses. I do disagree that what it is like for me to smell roses is
peculiar and markedly different from your experience of smelling a rose. I
happen to think our experiences are roughly equal. Whether you or I like the
smell of roses or not involves more than just the phenomenal experience. In
other words, there’s a lot of background noise that explains why you like the
smell more than I do. Perhaps I associate the smell of roses with wakes and
funerals rather than with candlelit dinners and weddings. The noise is not
what I want to focus on.

  1. October 10, 2021 - 2:18 pm Pingback: [Why Reincarnation is Incompatible With Naturalism | The Philosophy Corner](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/10/10/why-reincarnation-is-incompatible-with-naturalism/)

This, in fact, falls on the horns of a dilemma Buddhists have. Recall,
Buddhists hold to the concept of _anattā_ (no self). While I may have thrown
around the word ‘identity’, this need not imply that I believe identity to be
_real_ and _substantive_. In fact, I think it is entirely illusory and that if
we interact with enough people, we will find that we have more in common than
we would like to admit. Some of us have delusions of grandeur; we have god and
savior complexes, see ourselves as fixers, and believe that there is no
problem we cannot solve. Others choose to mind their business, to not take on
a deep personal investment in the struggles even loved ones go through, and
instead choose to let the people around us work through their own problems. In
one way or another, it is likely that my two brief sketches of identity
resonate with my readers. Either you are one who suffers from delusions of
grandeur and you base even your romantic relationships on this futile attempt
to save everyone. Or, you are someone who has no deep personal investment in
the problems even the people closest to you have; this isn’t to say you refuse
to help when asked, but you prefer to let people find their own way. If one of
the two people I have described describes aspects of you, then you are further
to committing to the premise that mental states are finite and that therefore,
identities are limited.

Buddhists have long struggled to reconcile the idea of reincarnation with
_anattā_ , but a resolution isn’t difficult to come by. Before offering a
solution, I defer to Wildman:

Unfortunately, we are no longer so taken by behaviorists and know that human
beings are a lot more than simply a finite set of behaviors. We have our
preferences, things we are repulsed by, idiosyncrasies, and personalities to
speak of. Even then, I think that the combination of traits that make you
_you_ , no matter how multifarious, are finite. This implies that given a long
enough time, some sentient being, whether homo sapien or something very
similar to our own species, will come to believe in the same _you_ you believe
you are. This, to my mind, is how naturalism makes room for reincarnation.

There is no substantive self that persists, a soul as it were. There is,
however, a persistent illusion in all of us and I do not put it passed a being
eons from now to think that s/he is exactly who I think I am. Furthermore, I
do not discount the idea that s/he will _feel_ , phenomenologically speaking,
exactly as I do. There is this sense that _I am_. Whether or not identity is
real, the illusion is powerful enough to lead me to believe I am unique and
that there will never be another exactly like me. This is folly. So while
there is no substantive soul in me or in my cat, there are a number of mental
states, resulting from brain and nerve interactions, that make both of us
_feel_ like we are a unique individuals never to be replicated. I conclude
that it is far likelier that since there are not infinite mental states to go
around, there are not infinite illusions to go around either. What we refer to
as the soul or identity has its boundaries and limits. There will be another
_you_ , so in that sense, even after death, should the universe persist, _you_
will live again with no recollection of the _you_ you are right now.

This may seem particularly discomforting for some readers. For others, they
may think that this idea is not developed enough. I admit, the argument is
very bare bones and could use more flesh. That, however, does not mean the
argument is unsound. I happen to be convinced, first and foremost, that mental
states and what we call identities do not stretch to infinity and that
therefore, there are only so many _yous_ to go around. As such, _you_ will
live again or be reborn. This is how naturalism makes room for something as
mystical as reincarnation. The lesson is that naturalists should shun the
habit of dismissing an idea because it is religious or _prima facie_
supernatural. There might be a kernel of truth to the idea of reincarnation.
That remains to be seen, but my argument is certainly a good place to start.

Either the theist will continue to assert that the Second Way is sound,
epistemic warrant and justification be damned, or they will abandon their
dubious propositional idealism and run a soundness test. Checking whether the
Second Way or the Negated Second Way is sound would inevitably bring them into
contact with empirical evidence supporting one argument or the other. As I
have shown with the KCA, it appears that considerations of time, from a
philosophical and quantum mechanical perspective, greatly lower the
probability of the KCA being sound. This follows neatly into Aquinas’ Second
Way and as such, one has far less epistemic justification for believing the
KCA or Aquinas’ Second Way are sound. The greater justification is found in
the negated versions of these arguments.

The implication here is that _time began to exist_ , but _the universe did not
begin to exist_. A recent paper implies that this is most likely the case
([Quantum Experiment Shows How Time ‘Emerges’ from
Entanglement](https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/quantum-experiment-
shows-how-time-emerges-from-entanglement-d5d3dc850933). _The Physics arXiv
Blog_. 23 Oct 2013. Web.). The very hot, very dense singularity before the
emergence of time at T=0 would have been subject to quantum mechanics rather
than the macroscopic forces that came later, e.g., General Relativity. As
such, the conditions were such that entanglement could have resulted in the
emergence of time in our universe, but not the emergence of the universe. All
of the matter and energy were already present before the clock started to
tick. Conversely, if the universe is akin to a growing runner, then the
toddler is at the starting line before the gun goes off. The sound of the gun
starts the clock. The runner starts running sometime _after_ she hears the
sound. As she runs, she goes through all the stages of childhood, puberty,
adolescence, adulthood, and finally dies. Crucially, the act of her running
and her growth do not begin until after the gun goes off. Likewise, no changes
take place at T=0; all changes take place _after_ T=0. While there is this
notion of entanglement, resulting in a change occurring before the clock even
started ticking, quantum mechanics demonstrates that quantum changes do not
require time and in fact, may result in the emergence of time. Therefore, it
is plausible that though time began to exist at the Big Bang, the universe did
_not_ begin to exist ** _—_** thus, making the MT Negated KCA sound. The KCA
is therefore, false.

Of relevance is how one would proceed if one is unsure of the argument.
Thankfully, we no longer live in a world in where one would have to go out of
their way to measure the heights of the three buildings. A simple Google
search will suffice. The Freedom Tower is ~546m. The Empire State Building is
~443. The Chrysler is ~318m. Granted, this is knowledge by way of _testimony_.
I do not intend to connote religious testimony. What I intend to say is that
one’s knowledge is grounded on knowledge directly acquired by someone else. In
other words, at least one other person actually measured the heights of these
buildings and these are the measurements they got.

Every deductive argument can be negated. I consider this an uncontroversial
statement. The problem is, there are people who proceed as though deductive
arguments speak to an _a priori truth_. The Freedom Tower is taller than the
Empire State Building; the Empire State Building is taller than the Chrysler
Building; therefore, the Freedom Tower is taller than the Chrysler Building.
This is an example of an _a priori truth_ because given that one understands
the concepts of taller and shorter, the conclusion follows uncontroversially
from the premises. This is one way in which the soundness of an argument can
be assessed.

This is a valid modus ponens. I have changed the argument form of Craig’s
Moral Argument and I now have what I think to be a better negation of his
argument. From P2, atheists can find satisfaction. This is the epistemic
proposition atheists are committed to. The conclusion also alleviates any
concerns moral realists might have had with the MT Negated Moral Argument. For
my own purposes, I think this argument works better. That, however, is beside
the point. The point is that this forces theists to either justify the
premises of Craig’s Moral Argument, i.e. prove that the argument is sound, or
assert, on the basis of mere faith, that Craig’s argument is true. In either
case, one will have succeeded in either forcing the theist to abandon their
propositional idealism, in getting them to test the argument against the world
as ontologically construed or in getting them to confess that they are
indulging in circular reasoning and confirmation bias, i.e. getting them to
confess that they are irrational and illogical. Both of these count as
victories. We can explore whether other arguments for God fall on this sword.

Ultimately, one either succeeds at making the theist play the game according
to the right rules or getting them to admit their beliefs are not properly
epistemic at all; instead, they believe by way of blind faith and all of their
redundant arguments are exercises in circular reasoning and any pretense of
engaging the evidence is an exercise in confirmation bias. Arguments for God
are a perfect example of directionally motivated reasoning (see Galef, Julia.
_The Scout Mindset: Why Some People See Things Clearly and Others Don’t_. New
York: Portfolio, 2021. 63-66. Print). I much prefer accuracy motivated
reasoning. We are all guilty of motivated reasoning, but _directionally_
motivated reasoning is indicative of irrationality and usually speaks to the
fact that one holds beliefs that do not square with the facts. Deductive
arguments are only useful insofar as premises can be supported by evidence,
which therefore makes it easier to show that an argument is sound. This is why
we can reason that if Socrates is a man, more specifically, the ancient Greek
philosopher that we all know, then Socrates was indeed mortal and that is why
he died in 399 BCE. Likewise, this is why we cannot reason that objective
morality can only be the case if the Judeo-Christian god exists, that if the
universe began to exist, God is the cause, and that if the series of efficient
causes cannot regress infinitely and must terminate somewhere, they can only
terminate at a necessary first cause, which some call God. These arguments can
be negated and the negations will show that they are either absurd or that the
reasoning in the arguments is deficient and rests on the laurels of
directionally motivated reasoning due to a bias for one’s religious faith
rather than on the bedrock of carefully reasoned, meticulously demonstrated,
accuracy motivated reasoning which does not ignore or omit pertinent facts.

For a more complicated treatment, Malpass and Morriston argue that “one cannot
traverse an actual infinite in finite steps” (Malpass, Alex & Morriston, Wes
(2020). Endless and Infinite. _Philosophical Quarterly_ 70 (281):830-849.). In
other words, from a mathematical point of view, T=0 is the x-axis. All of the
events after T=0 are an asymptote along the x-axis. The events go further and
further back, ever closer to T=0 but never actually touch it. For a visual
representation, see below:

Likewise, the choice has to be made when confronting Craig’s Moral Argument.
Craig’s Moral Argument is a modus tollens. For the uninitiated, it simply
states: [((p –> q) ^ ~q) –> ~p] (Potter, A. (2020). The rhetorical structure
of Modus Tollens: An exploration in logic-mining. _Proceedings of the Society
for Computation in Linguistics, 3_ , 170-179.). Another way of putting it is
that one is _denying the consequent_. That is precisely what Craig does.
“Objective moral values do not exist” is the consequent q. Craig is saying ~q
or “Objective moral values do exist.” Therefore, one route one can take is
keeping the argument form and negating P1, which in turn negates P2.

This argument is considerably longer than the KCA, but there are still areas
where the argument can be negated. I think P1 is uncontroversial and so, I do
not mind starting from there:

The key is to come up with a negation that is either sound or, at the very
least, free of any controversy. Straight away, I do not like P2. Moral
realists would also deny this negation because, to their minds, P2 is not
true. The controversy with P2 is not so much whether it is true or false, but
that it falls on the horns of the objectivism-relativism and moral
realism/anti-realism debates in ethics. The argument may accomplish something
with respect to countering Craig’s Moral Argument, but we are in no better
place because of it. This is when we should explore changing the argument’s
form in order to get a better negation.

To whet the appetite, let us consider a well-known deductive argument and let
us ignore, for the moment, whether it is sound:

Whether the universe is finite or eternal has been debated for millennia and
in a sense, despite changing context, the debate rages on. If the universe is
part of an eternal multiverse, it is just one universe in a vast sea of
universes within a multiverse that has no temporal beginning. Despite this,
the MT Negated KCA demonstrates how absurd the KCA is. The singularity was
already there ‘before’ the Big Bang. The Big Bang started the cosmic clock,
but the universe itself did not begin to exist. This is more plausible.
Consider that everything that begins to exist does so when the flow of time is
already in motion, i.e. when the arrow of time pointed in a given direction
due to entropic increase reducible to the decreasing temperature throughout
the universe. Nothing that has ever come into existence has done so
simultaneously with time itself because any causal relationship speaks to a
change and change requires the passage of time, but at T=0, no time has
passed, and therefore, no change could have taken place. This leads to an
asymmetry. We thus cannot speak of anything beginning to exist at T=0. The MT
Negated KCA puts cosmology in the right context. The universe did not come
into existence at T=0. T=0 simply represents the first measure of time; matter
and energy did not emerge at that point.

With all arguments, a decision must be made. First, an assessment of the
argument form is in order. Is it a modus ponens (MP) or a modus tollens (MT)?
Perhaps it is neither and is instead, a categorical or disjunctive syllogism.
In any case, one has to decide which premise(s) is going to be negated or
whether by virtue of the argument form, one will have to change the argument
form to state the opposite. You can see this with the original example. I
could have very well negated P2 and stated “Socrates is not a man.” Socrates
is an immortal jellyfish that I tagged in the Mediterranean. Or he is an
eternal being that I met while tripping out on DMT. For purposes of the
argument, however, since he is not a man, at the very least, the question of
whether or not he is mortal is open. We would have to ask what Socrates is.
Now, if Socrates is my pet hamster, then yes, Socrates is mortal despite not
being a man. It follows that the choice of negation has to be in a place that
proves most effective. Some thought has to go into it.

Let us explore whether Craig’s Moral Argument falls victim to the negation
strategy. Craig’s Moral Argument is as follows:

Of course, matters are not so straightforward. Christian apologists offer no
arguments that are uncontroversially true like the original argument above.
Therefore, the negation strategy will prove extremely effective to disabuse
them of propositional idealism and to make them _empiricall_ y assess whether
their arguments are sound. What follows are examples of arguments for God that
have been discussed ad nauseam. Clearly, theists are not interested in
conceding. They are not interested in admitting that even one of their
arguments does not work. Sure, what you find are theists committed to Thomism,
for instance, and as such, they will reject Craig’s Kalam Cosmological
Argument (KCA) because it does not fit into their Aristotelian paradigm and
not because it is unsound. They prefer Aquinas’ approach to cosmological
arguments. What is more common is the kind of theist that ignores the
incongruity between one argument for another; since they are arguments for
God, it counts as evidence for his existence and it really does not matter
that Craig’s KCA is not Aristotelian. I happen to think that it is, despite
Craig’s denial, but I digress.

Technically, Craig’s KCA is a _categorical syllogism_. Such syllogisms present
a universal ( **∀** ) or existential quantifier (∃); the latter is introduced
by saying _all_. Consider, “all philosophers are thinkers; all philosophers
are logicians; therefore, all thinkers are logicians.” Conversely, one could
say “no mallards are insects; some birds are mallards; therefore, some birds
are not insects.” What Craig is stating is that _all_ things that begin to
exist have a cause, so if the universe is a thing that began to exist, then it
has a cause. Alternatively, his argument is an implicit modus ponens: “if the
universe began to exist, then it has a cause; the universe began to exist;
therefore, the universe has a cause.” In any case, the negation works because
if the universe did not begin to exist, then the universe is not part of the
group of all things that have a cause.

Most of our knowledge claims rest on testimony. Not everyone has performed an
experimental proof to show that the acceleration of gravity is 9.8m/s^2.
Either one learned it from a professor or read it in a physics textbook or
learned it when watching a science program. Or, they believe the word of
someone they trust, be it a friend or a grade school teacher. This does not
change that fact that if one cared to, one could exchange knowledge by way of
testimony for directly acquired knowledge by performing an experimental proof.
This is something I have done, so I do not believe on basis of mere testimony
that Newton’s law holds. I can say that it holds because I tested it for
myself.

The arguments for God, no matter how old or new, simple or complex, do not
work because not only do they rely on directionally motivated and patently
biased reasoning, but because when testing for soundness, being sure not to
exclude any pertinent evidence, the arguments turn out to be unsound. In the
main, they all contain controversial premises that do not work unless one
_already_ believes in God. So there is a sense in which these arguments exist
to give believers a false sense of security or more pointedly, a false sense
of certainty. Unlike my opponents, I am perfectly content with being wrong,
with changing my mind, but the fact remains, theism is simply not the sort of
belief that I give much credence to. Along with the [Vagueness
Strategy](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2019/06/17/arguments-
from-vagueness-against-the-so-called-god-of-monotheism/), the Negation
Strategy is something that should be in every atheist’s toolbox.

Finally, so that the Thomists do not feel left out, we can explore whether the
negation strategy can be applied to Aquinas’ Five Ways. For our purposes, the
Second Way is closely related to the KCA and would be defeated by the same
considerations. Of course, we would have to negate the Second Way so that it
is vulnerable to the considerations that cast doubt on the KCA. The Second Way
can be stated as follows:

This is extremely controversial for reasons we are all familiar with. That is
because everyone accepts that the original argument is sound. When speaking of
‘men’, setting aside the historical tendency to dissolve the distinction
between men and women, what is meant is “all human persons from everywhere and
at all times.” Socrates, as we know, was an ancient Greek philosopher who
reportedly died in 399 BCE. Like all people before him, and presumably all
people after him, he proved to be mortal. No human person has proven to be
immortal and therefore, the original argument holds.

If someone were completely disinterested in checking whether this argument,
which is merely a finite set of propositions, coheres with the world or
reality, I would employ my **negation strategy** : the negation of an argument
someone assumes to be sound without epistemic warrant or justification. The
strategy forces them into exploring whether their argument or its negation is
sound. Inevitably, the individual will have to abandon their bizarre
commitment to a sort of propositional idealism (namely that propositions can
_only_ be logically assessed and do not contain any real world entities
contextually or are not claims about the world). In other words, they will
abandon the notion that “All men are mortal” is a mere proposition lacking
context that is not intended to make a claim about states of affairs
objectively accessible to everyone, including the person who disagrees with
them. With that in mind, I would offer the following:

Again, negation can take place in two places: P1 or P2. Negating P1, however,
does not make sense. Negating P2, like in the case of his Moral Argument,
changes the argument form; this is arguable and more subtle. So we get the
following:

> We perceive a series of efficient causes of things in the world.

This matches Plantinga’s Ignorance Defense one-to-one. There is therefore, no
need to belabor the point. My concern is twofold: the failure of skeptical
theism should be clear and since this appeal to human ignorance is an
obstinate roadblock borne of a reluctance to accept an atheistic conclusion,
it is crucial to develop arguments that make use of its faulty intuition and
arguments that leave no room for a skeptical theistic response. In other
words, if the intuition can be turned on its head, in a perfect example of how
to employ the double standard and outsider tests (see Galef, Julia. _The Scout
Mindset: Why Some People See Things Clearly and Others Don’t_. New York:
Portfolio, 2021. 63-66. Print), perhaps the theist is not in a position to see
the vast shortcomings of skeptical theism. This is what I want to do because I
am at a loss when it comes to understanding why anyone would think such a
response works when confronting The Evidential Problem of Evil and
Schellenberg’s Divine Hiddenness Argument. For our purposes, I will set aside
stating explicitly The Evidential Problem of Evil, as I think it is
unnecessary review for the initiated. Schellenberg’s Divine Hiddenness
Argument, on the other hand, is not as familiar, even to the thoroughly
initiated. Thankfully, Veronika Weidner has explicitly stated the argument
accurately:

> that are apparently pointless. Indeed there are many cases of such evils

RC2 An infinite god or even a vastly powerful deity would have an infinite or
incalculable phenomenal distance from humans.

c) The whole accounting that is done really puts a lack of value on human life
that turns out to be nihilistic and even fatalistic. The Black Plague wiped
out millions. Are we really to believe any good repaid that debt? Are we
supposed to buy that the life of a child, whose loss emotionally crippled her
mother, is worth so little that we can just make do with the fact that some
future kid was saved from danger in her place? That does nothing at all to
alleviate the suffering the child and her mother experienced, so that is
another issue, one of currency: what is the value of this coin God is paying
his debts with and how exactly does it exchange with the coin in the sometimes
distant past?

In the end, I think the lines of argumentation I have pursued here are by no
means exhaustive, in that a lot more can be said about evil, suffering,
hiddenness, God’s lack of supererogative agency, and an indifference stemming
from the incalculable, if not, infinite phenomenal distance he has from us. I
defer to Rieux: “No Father. I’ve a very different idea of love. And until my
dying day I shall refuse to love a scheme of things in which children are put
to torture” (Camus, Ibid., 218).

Weidner’s next stop is to grapple with the conclusion of My Argument From
Assailability: “if we find in any being, a characteristic that is assailable,
then we have no reason to call it a god.” How is a non-perfect theistic being
different from an alien, one might ask. Crucially, if per the hiddenness and
evil arguments, God does not seem open to being in a relationship with all
human beings and does not intervene when great atrocities happen, then we have
located an assailable characteristic. How does an omnipotent or, at least, an
incredibly powerful being succumb to bystander effect? Even if God is not all-
powerful and could not snap the Nazis out of existence, if he is at least
powerful enough to assume a disguise and poison Hitler and his top advisers,
why not step in and prevent the Holocaust?

We are then asked “to stick with a belief in what we see to be some kind of
_possibility_ , namely that God is, after all, appearances to the contrary
notwithstanding, perfectly good” (Ibid.). This as an obstinate appeal to the
very faith that needs to be substantiated. Furthermore, this appears to imply
the superiority of faith over reason. Like Galileo, who no doubt said this
with a different sentiment, I “do not feel obliged to believe that same God
who endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect had intended for us to forgo
their use” (Galilei, Galileo, [“Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina of
Tuscany, 1615”](https://digitalcommons.bard.edu/sr-instruct/97/) (2013).
_Instructional Resources_. 97.).

This novel argument, not to be confused with Mander’s “Does God know what it
is like to be me?” (see Mander, W.J. (2002), Does God Know What It is Like to
be Me?. The Heythrop Journal, 43: 430-443.
<https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-2265.00203>) completely evades skeptical theism.
It is an argument from analogy in where an observation about human behavior is
mapped onto God. The argument has been alluded to before, but as far as I
know, has not been formally stated or given a name.

Contingency arguments only accomplish one thing: they point to the existence
of metaphysical necessities, quite possibly something like brute facts, that
can be explained by something more concrete like physical necessity. In [my
overview of Rasmussen’s recent contingency
argument](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/03/06/rebuking-
rasmussens-geometric-argument/), I go over what this looks like and it is more
plausible than crossing the infinite chasm between a necessary cause and a
necessary being on blind faith alone. In any case, since we cannot know what
necessity is _really_ like and since we cannot visit the realm of necessity,
it is best we accept our ignorance on this matter. The intuition of skeptical
theism undermines what many theists consider one of the stronger lines of
argumentation in favor of theism.

I have a sneaking suspicion that theists feel the gnaw of these defeaters.
Atheists certainly do. This then becomes an exercise of being overly
charitable to a kind of argument that can never prove successful. If skeptical
theism fails, it is a thread that should be cut and discarded. There are a
couple of minor problems that are important as well:

B) On exclusivism, many of today’s atheists are eternally lost because evil
and hiddenness were just too persuasive and the goods never came due within
our lifetimes. On universalism, this is all arbitrary. This can be conjoined
to Street’s recent response to skeptical theism: we are free to indulge moral
aporia because no matter what we believe or not, we will ultimately be saved
(see Street, S. (2014). If everything happens for a reason, then we don’t know
what reasons are: Why the price of theism is normative skepticism. In M.
Bergmann & P. Kain (Eds.), _Challenges to moral and religious belief:
Disagreement and evolution_ (pp. 172–192). Oxford: Oxford University Press.).
So talk of evil and hiddenness and unknown goods to account for them ends up
being null.

RC1 Human beings have phenomenal distance from earthworms and therefore, are
indifferent to them, e.g. we walk through a parking lot on a rainy day and
probably trample dozens of them underfoot with no second thought.

A) Even if we grant that unforeseen goods balance the scales, as it were, i.e.
justifies the 1,800 cancer-related deaths of children per year in the United
States, there is no way for finite human minds to causally connect these
deaths with the goods whenever they arrive; the most we can do is callously
reason that their deaths are akin to necessary sacrifices that enable us to
eventually find a cure—which is related to minor problem (a) below and more
importantly, is not something we should ever give God credit for; developing
cures is a slow, painstaking process that does not involve anything like
putative revelation or God whispering the secrets to a much needed vaccine in
a doctor’s ear. There is also the issue that the goods may arrive well after
our lifetimes, which segues into the next problem.

b) It begs the question because it really is no different from someone saying
“just wait and see!” Many people on all sides died waiting and seeing and per
Schellenberg, honestly sought divinity their entire lives and came up empty.
If God had a better track record of making do on past atrocities, then we
would be able to inductively reason, as many of us do with science, in this
manner. The thing is, it looks like the bills for the Holocaust and slavery
are overdue and all of us, living ~80 and ~450 years respectively, after these
atrocities happened, cannot even begin to causally connect potential goods
that God has deployed with the intention of paying this debt. Perhaps it is
too much to expect God to pay that debt because those were human crimes; but I
can also think of disasters, diseases, pandemics, mass extinctions, and other
natural evils that are overdue and again, I am not sure what goods are
intended to repay the extinctions of all of our hominid cousins, for example.

The intuition of skeptical theism, as I made clear at the outset, can be used
to cast doubt on contingency arguments across the board. Aside from the fact
that there is a chasm between a necessary cause, e.g., something like the Big
Bang, and a necessary being, we can assert that we should be skeptical of our
ability to discern what a necessary being is. How do we know that it is _one_
necessary being as opposed to many? If a Triune god solves the one-many
problem, then why not the Divine Septad of Zoroastrianism? Since we cannot
know what the realm of necessity is like, we should refrain from making these
kinds of arguments.

This, in a nutshell, is the Ignorance Defense. Humans are, in other words,
ignorant of God’s will and our wisdom pales in comparison to his. Nielsen’s
contention, however, has the makings of a perfect defeater. All that is needed
is to see his objection from the point of view of one of God’s attributes.
Nielsen states that “it looks more like, if he exists and is all powerful and
all knowing, that then he more likely to be evil” and adds that “we see that
all the same he _might possibly be_ , as Jewish, Christian, and Islamic
religions say he is, perfectly good. But we cannot see _that_ he is. The
Mosaic God looks, to understate it, petty, unjust, and cruel to us” (Ibid.).
This defeater is perfected if we see this from the point of view of God’s
omniscience. God would know that we would be incapable of seeing that he is
good in light of natural evil. This evil is, in fact, gratuitous. God would
have seen, by way of his omniscience, that the quantity of natural evil in the
world would be enough to drive so many to doubt. This apart from contradictory
revelations, the limited range and capacity of Christianity, i.e., its
incapacity to appeal to people of other cultures, e.g., Jews, Muslims, Hindus,
and indigenous people across every populated continent, and the negative
evidence against the existence of the Judeo-Christian god.

This argument avoids the nauseating intuition of skeptical theism as it cannot
appeal to any ignorance we have. One thing we are not ignorant of, as evil and
hiddenness make clear, is that either God does not exist or if any gods exist,
they are astoundingly indifferent to us. Camus, in _The Plague_ , observes
through the character of Tarrou that if God is not going to provide succor in
times of great atrocity, it is up to us to take the helm and do something
about our plights. Conjoined to his scathing criticisms of the religious
propensity to prefer the abstract over the concrete is Camus’ clearsighted
focus on God’s absence or indifference, for even as Jacques Othon dies in
agony and Father Paneloux shouts out “My God, spare this child!,” the child
dies writhing in pain and wailing across the halls of the auxiliary hospital
(Camus, Albert. _The Plague_. New York: Vintage International Books. 217.
Web.). This argument is yet another powerful blow against personal being
theism because a friend is there in times of need and a father who loves his
children, all the more so. No appeal to our ignorance, as my defeaters make
clear, can be marshaled in to salvage the notion of the existence of a
personal being who loves us and has our well-being and prosperity in mind. The
absence or more tentatively, the indifference of God should disabuse one of
the belief in a personal being who loves us infinitely.

a) It is utilitarian in its analysis. The evil and hiddenness we experience
are lesser in magnitude when compared to the goods that await us, be it in
heaven or by way of some earthly recompense. The greater good overtones are
palpable. I cannot see how a being who is appealed to as the objective and
perfect moral standard can subscribe to utilitarianism given its shortcomings.

Skeptical Theism is overtly present in Plantinga’s Ignorance Defense. It must
be noted here that he does not call it that. The monicker makes sense because
it relies on human ignorance in order to work. In other words, the defense
states that since human wisdom is incomparable to God’s, we cannot know why he
allows evil. Moreover, since it is reasonable that he has some reason,
unbeknownst to us, for allowing evil, we cannot reasonably blame God for the
evil in the world. Of Plantinga’s explications, Kai Nielsen says the
following:

Prior to discussing Schellenberg’s argument in some detail, it is crucial to
understand why skeptical theism fails:

That, however, falls on the horns of my Argument From Assailability and so,
Theism is defeated in all its iterations. This is to say nothing about the
fact that even a finite deity would be far more capable of supererogatory acts
than we are. In any case, the intuition of my supererogative argument can be
turned on its head. We can deduce something about God’s power given this lack.
God must be much weaker than a hypothetical infinite being due to the fact
that he remains a bystander, utterly apathetic to even the worst atrocities
known to man ** _—_** even ones we played no part in causing. This is an
assailable characteristic. We therefore, have no obligation whatsoever to
worship a being that is apparently weaker than ourselves. As Tracie Harris
famously said: “If I could stop a person from raping a child I would. That is
the difference between me and your God” (Bennett-Smith, Meredith. [“‘Atheist
Experience’ TV Host Shocked By Caller’s Statement About Child Rape
(Video)”](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/atheist-experience-child-
rape_n_2434198). _Huffington Post_. 9 Jan 2013. Web). Ultimately, if God
appears to be this much weaker than human beings, who can potentially lose
their lives when intervening on the behalf of another person, it is far more
probable that God does not exist.

RC*: The condition of the argument is as follows: there is a difference
between the phenomenal experience of human beings and that of earthworms (if
it is even appropriate to think that worms have phenomenal experience). Even
if earthworms lack phenomenal consciousness, according to some philosophers,
we certainly have phenomenal consciousness and as such, there is a distance
between our experience and theirs.

The reason Aquinas and others maximized God to have infinite capacities in all
respects is because theists already saw the crippling limitations of a god
with finite abilities. The question would immediately follow: what motivation
is there to worship a being that is not perfect? Infinity entails
supererogative capacity. God would be able to give an infinite amount of love,
kinship, succor, power, knowledge, and presence and still retain an infinite
amount of each. So why does he seem to blithely refuse to commit to this?
Perfect and infinite personal being theism is defeated by the combination of
Schellenberg’s Divine Hiddenness Argument, The Evidential Problem of Evil, and
my argument from God’s apparent lack of supererogatory agency. What is left is
non-perfect being theism.

Now to turn my attention to an argument that subsumes the observations of The
Evidential Problem of Evil and The Divine Hiddenness Argument. This argument
is novel, forceful, and to my mind, defeats the idea of not just perfect
being, omni-god theism, but theism overall. Weidner already observes the
following: “After all, the hiddenness argument, if successful, helps us see
the deficiencies of personal perfect being theism” (Weidner, ibid.). My next
argument should help one see the deficiencies of theism in general.

Therefore, there must exist the necessary being that is the cause of all
contingent being (credit: [Queens Community
College](https://www.qcc.cuny.edu/socialsciences/ppecorino/intro_text/Chapter%203%20Religion/Cosmological.htm))

Naturalism is another argument available to an atheist operating under
inductive atheology. This is, in fact, the prevalent approach among modern day
atheists. Atheists may disagree on the details and therefore, espouse
different sorts of naturalism. However, the more prominent forms are
metaphysical and methodological. Methodological naturalism has two primary
forms: constructive and deflationary. Deflationary is based on–not
exclusively–the Natural Ontological Attitude (NOA). Arthur Fine describes it
as follows:

_A priori_ arguments fall in the purview of deductive atheology. Such atheists
would argue that the traditional view of God is incoherent. Such a God is not
possible on this view. The characteristics God purportedly has are
contradictory either in and of themselves or when one attempts to reconcile
them. Take for example J.L Mackie’s explication of the Omnipotence Paradox:
“can an omnipotent being make things which he cannot subsequently control? Or,
what is practically equivalent to this, can an omnipotent being make rules
which then bind himself?” (Mackie, J. L. 1955. Evil and omnipotence. _Mind_ 64
(254): 200-212. Available on
[web](https://href.li/?http://www.ditext.com/mackie/evil.html).). This is a
more generalized version of the Omnipotence Paradox, which usually asks: can
God create a stone he cannot lift? Therefore, the paradox can be viewed as an
argument attempting to show that omnipotence is incoherent in and of itself.
The argument attempts to accomplish this by dividing omnipotence into two
components, which I call _functional_ and _physical_. Functional omnipotence
is the capacity to _will_ anything whilst physical omnipotence is the capacity
to _do_ anything. Therefore, the argument attempts to show that it is possible
that God could will something he cannot do, in Mackie’s case, will something
that he cannot control or in the general case, will the existence of a stone
so heavy that he cannot complete the particular task of lifting it.

An atheist operating under inductive atheology has several possible
approaches. Whether or not one can prove a negative is too tangential a topic
to cover here, but assuming it’s possible, one could offer Michael Martin’s
argument:

Analytic atheism also attempts to answer the question: what is atheism? To
accomplish this, however, the normative component has to be consulted. The
analytic component will provide theories of atheism or more simply, accounts
of what atheism should be, therefore providing possible answers to the
question of normative atheism. The analytic component is therefore,
responsible for determining which account best captures what atheism is or
alternatively, what an atheist is.

The Fourth Wave may be the most powerful wave yet, but a glaring issue limits
its power: there are people who not only misunderstand feminism, but also
either stand against feminism or misrepresent feminism. The former and the
latter are more related than one realizes. Those who misrepresent feminism are
very often responsible for those who stand against it. Some Christians and
Muslims believe that women are inferior to men and will therefore oppose
feminism by default, but there are anti-feminists who do not have religious
reasons for opposing feminism. Their reasons are based on the
misunderstandings of self-proclaimed feminists.

Perhaps the final route such an atheist can take is to argue that the failure
of theistic arguments entails atheism. In other words, since arguments for God
fail, it is reasonable to hold that god does not exist. Such an atheist, for
example, will argue that since the Kalam Cosmological Argument fails to prove
that God created the universe, we should believe that such an agent did not
create the universe. Alternatively, she will argue that since the Ontological
Argument fails to show the existence of a necessary being, this being is
instead impossible. Whether or not these arguments hold are of no interest at
the time. This is, however, how such an atheist will proceed.

What kind of change is the label of feminism about? Feminism concerns securing
equality for women. Women should have the same opportunities men have. Women
should have the same rights men have. Women should be respected in their
careers the way men are; they should be paid equally. There should be no sex-
based differences in academia, the workplace, at home, or anywhere else. When
this is spelled out, it is an uncontroversial perspective. There should be no
reason for anyone to oppose the affirmation that women should be equal to men.

What an atheist is, is perhaps best defined by the approach s/he chooses. The
approach chosen or a combination of these approaches might help us to arrive
at a better definition of atheism. There’s fallibilism, deductive atheology,
and inductive atheology. The latter two are encompassed by evidentialism. This
position is arguably most familiar to modern atheists:

Metaphysical naturalism is a robust worldview that often requires lengthy
elucidation. This has been done by, for example, Richard Carrier who states:

Another route such an atheist takes is the attempt to show that any given
attributes of God are irreconcilable.

Atheism is not merely an epistemic stance concerning belief in god, but a
robust philosophical position that contains an analytic component. Analytic
atheism is concerned with what is meant by theism and what is meant by God.
Atheists, however, will not always agree with the answers provided by theists.
A theist may respond to the first question and say that God is existence. An
atheist might object by saying that such a definition is inconsistent with
what theists commonly profess and that what they usually profess is much more
elementary. God, for example, is man-like. He is pleased or displeased; given
the latter, he is prone to anger. Furthermore, he purportedly has properties
that cannot be attributed to mere existence: he is omniscient, omnipotent,
eternal, timeless. The atheist could also respond by stating that defining God
as existence is much too vague. The aim of a definition is description; this
definition, however, fails to describe what is meant by God.

Likewise, there should be no opposition at all when I say that Black people
and minorities, more generally, should be equal to Whites. There is nothing
wrong with saying that if a Black man commits a crime or fails to comply with
police, he should not be gunned down. White men have committed crimes on a
much larger scale and were escorted away in handcuffs. White men do not have
to worry about police officers kneeling on their necks or shooting 41 rounds
at them. Timothy McVeigh murdered 168 people, including 19 children, in an act
of domestic terrorism, and he walked away with his life (Gumbel, Andrew.
[“Oklahoma City bombing: 20 years later, key questions remain
unanswered”](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/13/oklahoma-city-
bombing-20-years-later-key-questions-remain-unanswered). _Guardian_. 13 Apr
2015. Web.). That is because he was given the right to a fair trail. In this
country, a Black man selling loose cigarettes on a corner can be the victim of
extrajudicial execution. There is nothing controversial about saying that even
the life of an accused Black criminal matters. Innocent until proven guilty
applies to Black people or at least, it _should_ apply to Black people.

Ultimately, labels in and of themselves are futile. We should do away with
labels and instead flesh out what we stand for. This leaves little room for
error and leaves our enemies fully exposed. This is not to say that people
cannot disagree with atheism and naturalism, for instance. They are more than
welcome to. What this does mean is that they cannot make the vacuous claim
that I suppress God in my unrighteousness or that I hate God or that I choose
to not believe because I prefer to indulge sinful concupiscence. These are
comfortable things Christians say to avoid the fact that people have good
reasons for not believing in God. My robust descriptions of atheism and
naturalism leave no room for speculation of the sort. It gives them no space
at all to go with a definition that allows them to slander people like myself.
Labels do not accomplish this. Fuller descriptions of what is meant by a label
go much further. Let us abandon our labels and instead, describe in greater
detail what we stand for.

Fugitives are the people anti-feminists get these ideas from, young girls who
are themselves anti-feminists or who identify a feminists and confess to
things that are not at all in keeping with the movement: that feminists hate
men; that feminists want to exclude them; that feminists seek female dominance
and perhaps a matriarchy; that feminists are looking to devalue masculine
attributes; that feminists ignore the effects the patriarchy has on men and
that they, in fact, ignore men’s issues across the board. These ideas are not
true to feminism, but there’s still the question as to why people think they
are. Mackay has a succinct summary of feminism and not surprisingly, she
alludes to common misconceptions:

> all they are) which involve belief in spiritual realities. Even Buddhism,

Proponents of Capitalism are enamored with the idea of Capitalism. They,
however, ignore the reality of it. Inequality the world over is perpetuated by
Western ideas and interference. In the year that COVID-19 has wreaked havoc in
the United States, workers have lost over $3.7 trillion to date while the
wealth of top billionaires has increased by $3.9 trillion. This can be seen as
one of the largest redistributions of wealth in history (see
[here](https://www.businessinsider.com/workers-lost-37-trillion-in-earnings-
during-the-pandemic-2021-1) and
[here](https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-made-39-trillion-during-
the-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccines-2021-1)). A lot more can be said about
Capitalism, perhaps in a separate post for another day. The point I am making
now is that the labels of Black Lives Matter, feminist, anti-Capitalist, and
the like do not necessarily pertain to Far Left politics. Once these labels
are made explicit, in that one makes clear what they mean in practice, it
should strike anyone as absurd to be diametrically opposed to these positions.

Where such authorities are silent, metaphysical naturalism is capable of
providing possible answers. Take, for instance, consciousness. Metaphysical
naturalism can offer cogent explanations within the _physicalist_ framework.
For instance, with respect to consciousness, some naturalists have offered
some version of supervenience. On fallibilism, an atheist can argue that a
theist has come to a given conclusion because he hasn’t considered all the
relevant evidence (McCormick, Ibid.). In fact, part of this attitude plays a
role in discussions between theists and atheists. Theists, generally speaking,
make it quite obvious that they are not aware of all of the relevant evidence.
William Lane Craig, for example, employs a perfunctory or selective grasp of
cosmology in order to support his KCA. It is reasonable to conclude that if he
were aware of all of the evidence or if he did not omit counter-evidence, his
conclusion would be different. Unfortunately, this might be too generous.
Craig has been made aware of the evidence and regardless of the fact, he still
chooses to endorse the KCA. So in some cases, it is not just that a theist’s
knowledge is fallible, but it is that they disregard the fact and do not care
to correct it. Even worse, apologists are in the habit of omitting evidence to
the contrary.

NOA is an alternative to scientific realism and anti-realism. “Both realism
and anti-realism add an unwanted philosophical gloss to science” (Ibid.).
Therefore, the position neither agrees with scientific realism nor anti-
realism. At first glance, NOA may sound exactly like scientific realism, but
there are key differences that should be considered (e.g. the correspondence
theory of truth doesn’t factor into Fine’s NOA). Constructive naturalism
differs from NOA because it “involves commitment to a definite method for
resolving ontological matters” (Ibid.).Such a naturalist may make use of, for
example, Quine’s Naturalized Epistemology.

That leaves open the question as to why people on the right see these
positions as fundamentally opposed to their brand of politics. Again, if your
political party imposes these discriminatory and even racist views on you, it
is good sign that you should renounce it. There are ways to be fiscally
conservative, a proponent of small government, and so on without subscribing
to views that promote racial, gender, and wealth inequality. I fail to see how
what I have had outlined is unclear or nonsensical. The isms, once unpacked,
should not be as controversial. This is why I prefer stating my positions
clearly, so that there is no room for misconstruing, misrepresenting, straw
manning, and so on. There is, in my book, a difference between an opponent and
an enemy. The enmity I reserve for my enemies has everything to do with the
fact that they think their ignorance is better than my knowledge, their apathy
superior to my empathy, their desire to oppress groups they dislike equal to
my desire for equality. Opponents, by contrast, can have their minds changed.
The omission of relevant facts is not the same as ignorance. My enemies intend
to ignore that which disagrees with or defeats their views and more
importantly, they intend to cause harm to people like myself, so they do so by
weaponizing their right to vote to further marginalized groups they want to
harm. Then they pretend to be innocent because they are not drawing a firearm.
They might as well. Voting for a candidate that does not care about the
plights of minorities, women, non-Christians, etc. is a deliberate attempt to
harm these groups. You are not innocent.

Isms abound and nuance is sorely needed. I think my readers ought to follow my
lead and shed their isms. In place of these various isms, they should offer
clear definitions of what they mean by these isms. I think definitions are
more robust and are more capable of giving, especially detractors, an idea of
what a label means in practice. I will now outline a few of my various isms
and unpack them, so that people can start to see the absurdity of opposing
some of them. In place of these labels, I will offer explanations for why I
identity with these views.

What makes this argument inductive is P3 and P4. P3 and P4 hold hitherto and
thus, there is the tacit assumption that they will hold going forward. In
other words, that the future will resemble the past.

Lastly, the definition “lack of belief in gods” is inadequate because it
alludes to everyday beliefs. It is correct to say I _lack_ or do not have the
belief that Jesus died for my sins and resurrected three days later, and then
ascended to the right hand of the Father where he now intercedes on my behalf.
Religious beliefs of this sort are not properly epistemic beliefs, which are
“the attitude[s] we have, roughly, whenever we take something to be the case
or regard it as true” (Schwitzgebel, Eric.
[“Belief”](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/). _Stanford Encyclopedia
of Philosophy_. 2019. Web.). Atheists, therefore, have the epistemic belief
that the available evidence makes it much more probable than not that there
are no gods or spiritual entities whatsoever. Naturalism, whether some of us
like it or not, is a framework that has imposed itself on us. Even in cases
where we assume supernatural or paranormal explanations, thorough
investigation renders a much more mundane explanation. For some people, it is
difficult to accept that the world is not fantastical. Severed limbs do not
regenerate in the name of Jesus, people do not rise from the dead when a spell
is invoked, and our ancestors do not protect us from physical harm. Thorough
investigations only yield naturalistic, reproducible explanations. So when
someone proclaims a belief that does not speak to knowledge or truth, but
rather, faith, I can definitely say I do not share or that I lack that belief.
Now when speaking of properly epistemic beliefs, I have the attitude that
atheism is the case; atheism is true in that the various claims of religion do
not hold up to scrutiny and that moreover, gods are entirely absent in the
scope of all of our explanations. In other words, star formation, planet
formation, the arrangement of the earliest, simplest metabolisms, the
evolution of species, and ultimately, every model of the universe’s origin do
not require a god in order to make sense.

When atheism is spelled out in this much detail, detractors are given no room
to disingenuously offer a definition they prefer, one that allows them to
malign atheists and misrepresent what they stand for. The label of atheism is
futile. The definition or perhaps better said, the practice clearly spells out
what it is that I stand for. The same applies to naturalism. The label no
longer applies. Instead, I prefer to make explicit what I mean by it. Kai
Nielsen explains the intimate connection between atheism and naturalism best:

In the past, I have used this term and I have done so to differentiate myself
from _Democrats_. I am not a Centrist, a sycophant who condones incompetence
and corruption on both sides while pretending that they are both exemplary.
Neither political party in the United States is morally admirable. While it is
the case that Democrats are marginally better, there is still a lot that they
get wrong, hence my anti-Democratic, anti-Capitalist stances. I do not support
the American idea of Democracy because, like Mbembe, I recognize that it has a
nocturnal body: colonialism and every human rights violation that has followed
from it from slavery to the Jim Crow era to mass incarceration of Blacks after
a fabricated crack-cocaine epidemic. The United States is a hegemony, a
pseudo-Empire precisely because it destabilizes entire regions by rightfully
overthrowing despots and making the critical mistake of leaving a power vacuum
in their place. Terrorist factions are just a small part of this country
reaping what it sowed, but I digress.

The same applies to Asian Americans, who have recently become the target of
hate crimes across the country. Implicit here is that I am opposed to anyone
who endorses stereotypes about ethnic groups. So when the former President
joked about the “Kung Flu” and blamed China repeatedly for the COVID-19
outbreak, that was one of the many reasons I opposed him, his administration,
and his supporters. It is absurd to me that right-wingers in America are
roundly opposed to racial equality. They are also opposed to women securing
equality. There is a sense in which my political opponents are wholly aware of
what these labels mean and yet, they routinely choose to ignore the
definitions, no matter how clearly they are explained. It is not any lack of
clarity or sense on my part, but rather an obstinate decision to oppose
progress of this sort at every turn. Political affiliation should not keep
anyone from accepting my definitions or identifying with them. If your
political party prohibits you from even seeing the need for racial equality,
abandon the party or admit to having abandoned your moral integrity. There are
no two ways about it.

Same claim you made yesterday. Congrats, you’re not prohibited from
commenting. You did it to yourself. Your idiocy knows no bounds.

For one, we have newspapers, news outlets, cameras to record events, written
transcripts, and so on. Historians tasked with writing about our times have
different methods and source materials. So there’s no way we can hold the
Gospels to today’s standards, and that’s not what these scholars have done.

If consensus is what ultimately matters, then here are plenty of facts
compliments of Wikipedia.

As with Tacitus, even if the author doesn’t identify himself within the text,
there are other ways we can know who wrote the text. One way is to place one’s
name in the genitive, as Tacitus did. This isn’t to say that the name in the
genitive correctly attributes a work to said author in every case. This can
still be doubted. The Gospels, on the other hand, fail in this regards.
Ferguson states:

And so he suffered martyrdom; and they buried him on the spot, and the pillar
erected to his memory still remains, close by the temple. This man was a true
witness to both Jews and Greeks that Jesus is the Christ. And immediately
Vespasian besieged them.

Part of the reason Carrier doesn’t cite it in his own paper is because
Carrier’s conclusion is markedly different from Goldberg’s. Carrier’s
conclusion addresses James the brother of Jesus. The James passage isn’t
“almost universally” acknowledged as authentic as some have claimed, and that
has never been the case; more importantly, because of Carrier’s paper that
will never be the case. So what is Carrier’s conclusion?

After your first obscene sentence, I knew better than to read further.  
Here’s my rebuttal to this sloppy, amateuish Ferguson / Carrier love fest,
Forty-seven errors, before my back got sore. No obscenities welcome:

We have more historical evidence in the way of ancient manuscripts to support
the Jesus lived died and rose from the grave then we have to support the fact
that Caesar lived.

Carrier goes on to speak of Phelgon of Tralles. His analysis is interesting
and to my mind, thorough and conclusive. Anyone who’s interested can read his
full analysis which is cited below.

To repeat that last line: “nor any archaeological evidence to make them think
otherwise.”

That the authors don’t tell us who they are is a glaring issue because the
authors of historical accounts identify themselves, e.g., Jospephus,
Suetonius. It’s an issue, but it can be overcome. Tacitus, for instance, did
_not_ identify himself. Thus, this need not be the deciding factor in
concluding that the Gospels are historically unreliable. The question remains,
however, how exactly does one identify the author of a historical text. Though
we’re not discussing external attestation and internal consistency just yet,
these points relate to how we find out who the author of such a text is. It is
widely recognized that there’s not one generally accepted method for doing
this, but there are reliable ways. Matthew Ferguson outlines one way in which
we identify the author of an ancient historical text:

When concerning the genre of the Gospels, it is not straightforwardly obvious
to Christians that they are not historical accounts. Christians with more
literalist bents can’t see it any other way. This goes back to starting with a
comforting conclusion. The conclusion is that Jesus was god and that
therefore, the acts attributed to him in the Gospels actually happened.
Otherwise, it would be difficult to conclude that he was god incarnate. Take
away all of these fantastical acts and all you have is an itinerant first
century preacher. This is precisely who the historical Jesus was according to
the majority of scholars. They have, in other words, favored a minimal
historicist conclusion. They have, for all intents and purposes, stripped
Jesus of the divinity he demonstrated in the stories told by the Gospels. In
any case, the Gospels aren’t historical accounts. Matthew Ferguson outlines
the criteria historical texts meet:

Lastly, you didn’t ask questions. You beat your chest and made assertions. You
claimed that the other guy “refuted” a 20+ page argument with a mere assertion
that basically said: the fact that an x can’t be shown to exist in relation to
y doesn’t mean that x doesn’t exist; in other words, that god can’t be shown
to exist in relation to the Earth doesn’t mean god doesn’t exist. Yet on
Judaism and Christianity, god created the Earth. Modern science tells us that
planets have no creator; they form naturally over an extended period of time.
The history of our planet doesn’t resemble anything mentioned in the Bible. By
extension, god doesn’t exist in relationship to the universe; he didn’t create
it. A whiff of modern cosmology can tell you that.

3.So you agree with Darwin’s concern regarding morality?  
His concern for mankind was rooted in his observation that ,as Tennyson put
it,”nature is red in tooth and claw.”  
Right and wrong are then relative, not absolute.  
But, as an evolutionist, you will insist mankind can develope moral

The reason Dawkins admits that is, once again, going over your head. Evolution
is a biological process. The emergence of DNA is a chemical process. Want to
learn about it, research tRNA, though I’m quite sure you won’t understand that
either.

In order to understand the conclusion made, it is useful to quote the passage
in question. Then you’ll see why some scholars have concluded that Tacitus is
relaying hearsay.

Con’t-  
…can develope morals thru intellect.  
How then can you answer the existence of evil?  
Some people clearly choose to do evil because it pleases them to do evil.  
As you said earlier, Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world. But
acctually, Islam is the fastest growing FORCED religion in the world.  
Islam is therefore evil, yet the fastest growing religion/political ideology
in the world.  
Islam is immoral.  
That blows a great big hole in the evolutionary process of origin of morality.

Right. You read the opening sentence and threw a tantrum; big difference. I
opened with that because that’s the claim I was looking to substantiate and
given the scholarship in the post, I think I accomplished that. And you’re not
biased? Why else are you here commenting on an atheist’s page? In any case,
this isn’t about a bias. This is about a fair analysis. I know what your
apologists say; they’re not convincing. I know about Q (quella), the proposed
Aramaic gospel that Mark translated into Greek. Yet there’s no copy of Q and
it’s likely an authentic copy will never be found. Attempted reconstructions
are based on your favorite word, conjecture. People disagree with your
worldview; out of the two of us, you’re the only one that’s bothered by that.
I’ve not gone to your page and commented against anything, and believe me, I
could. I simply don’t feel the need to. My post isn’t about de-converting
Christians; it’s about opposing two common claims, claims that people make way
too often, and this without any attempts at substantiating them. I believe I
succeed at doing substantiating the counter claim. If you don’t think that,
show me why. Stop giving me these short, useless comments.

Um, where are you getting this figure from? The overwhelming majority of
biblical scholars and Jewish rabbis today openly concede the Pentateuch is
geopolitical myth, an origin dream devised by Judean priests (from Judah) to
capitalise on the weakened Kingdom of Israel after it’s sacking in 722 BCE. It
is not until about halfway through the Book of Kings when it actually becomes
a reliable historical source concerning the early Hebrews. Rabbi’s admit this,
KQ. Rabbi’s are quite open about this.

Just so you know, the **_only_** area where there is still a live debate
regarding biblical archaeology is whether or not Judah had an urban society in
the 9th Century BCE, which relates to the narrative concerning the United
Kingdom. That’s it. That’s all there is. The Patriarchs, Egypt, Moses, Exodus
and Conquest are **dead subjects** in the field of **serious** archaeology.
They were dismissed as myth decades ago, and nothing has changed in that time
to alter this consensus. As Israel’s oldest daily Newspaper, Hareetz,
announced recently:

“He has no form or comeliness;  
And when we see Him,  
There is no beauty that we should desire Him.

Also, Tacitus would have known that Pilate was a prefect and not a procurator.
At best, the passage describes an event that involved early Christians and it
also establishes that a man known as Christus was crucified by Pilate. It
doesn’t establish that he resurrected. It doesn’t establish that he performed
miracles. It doesn’t establish that he walked on water. It doesn’t establish
that he ascended to the right hand of the father. It is not corroboration for
the _Gospel_ Jesus.

As stated earlier, unless you’re a conservative New Testament scholar, this is
straightforwardly accepted. Of course, this isn’t widely accepted by
Christians, but that’s because this information isn’t as accessible as
misinformation. Apologetic works like Strobel’s “The Case For Christ” are much
more available. Furthermore, this sort of information isn’t openly discussed
in church or even in seminaries. Some seminaries will brainwash Christians
into thinking all of this is irrelevant. Unfortunately, it isn’t–most
especially when they’re trying to argue that the Gospels relay historical
events. The Gospels do not speak of a historical account.

17 France, R.T. [“The Gospels As Historical Sources For Jesus,The Founder Of
Christianity”](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.leaderu.com%2Ftruth%2F1truth21.html&t=ZDYwYjU4NTFlNWE1YjUxNzk3NDFlYjI1MmY0MTdkODZhMTljNTU1YixqVzJWUmJzSA%3D%3D).
_Leader University_. ND. Web.

Pliny’s letter to Trajan provided details concerning the trials Pliny
conducted. Though the letter mentions Christ, the letter gives more insight on
the practices of early Christians and the attitudes Roman officials had toward
them. Like the previous sources, it doesn’t give us any information on a
historical Jesus nor the divinity of Jesus as described in the Gospels.

15 Now some persons belonging to the seven [Jewish] sects existing among the
people, which have been before described by me in the Commentaries, asked
James: “What is the door of Jesus? And he replied that he was the Savior. In
consequence of this answer, some believed that Jesus is the Christ. But the
sects before mentioned did not believe, either in a resurrection or in the
coming of one to requite every man according to his works; but those who did
believe, believed because of James. So, when many even of the ruling class
believed, there was a commotion among the Jews, and scribes, and Pharisees,
who said, “A little more, and we shall have all the people looking for Jesus
as the Christ.”

There are many patently false claims in this article. It is not true that “the
authors of historical accounts” always identify themselves — for instance, the
authors of the Analects, a very similar work to the gospels, do not. But
Bauckham argues that there are sufficient clues about the identities of two or
three evangelists.

In order to prove Christianity true, two central claims are necessary: the
Gospel Jesus is a historical person and the Gospels are historically reliable.
These are two related claims and both are verifiable or falsifiable. What
follows demonstrates exactly why both claims are false.

As stated earlier, I said I would return to the story of Jesus walking on
water. Despite what some modern Christians think, it can be argued that this
was never meant to be taken literally. Likewise, this story may have been
written as allegory.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy the essay. Once you read it, you’ll think twice
before ever trusting him again.

That’s another reason I blocked you: you are utterly incapable of
understanding my arguments and so you depended on a pretentious undergrad who
thought he did. His assertion is not enough to refute my argument. In fact,
all he’s concluding is the opposite of what he misunderstood as my conclusion.
My actual conclusion is this: x does not exist in relation to y iff it is
necessary that x exist in relation to y. If god did not create the Earth or
the universe, he doesn’t exist in relation to either, and by extension,
doesn’t exist; however, on Christianity, it is *necessary* that he does. Or is
he not a necessary being on your view?

“Neither the evangelists nor their first readers engaged in historical
analysis. Their aim was to confirm Christian faith (Lk 1.4; Jn 20.31).
Scholars generally agree that the Gospels were written forty to sixty years
after the death of Jesus. They thus do not present eyewitness or contemporary
accounts of Jesus’ life and teachings.”

I once brought my friend’s mom to church. She was touched and went up for
prayer. My ex pastor “prophesied” and said that god would deliver her from
drug addiction. Unfortunately, she never touched a drug in her life! She was
never an addict. She was *not* on a destructive path. She was so upset; she
never came back. Charismatic Pentecostal churches are more like cults; there
were plenty of Christians voicing their disagreement with that post.

The CMB is the residual radiation from the recombination epoch. Another red

Darwin was wrong about a lot of things. Darwin wasn’t infallible. Evolution
has developed as a theory since his day. Darwin also wasn’t an ethicist. I
would not look to him for advice about morality. But while we’re at it, people
have argued that morality can be explained in terms of evolution. See Frans de
Waal. Another red herring. This, once again, has nothing to do with my post.

Of these references, two, three, seven (?) and eight relate to the figure in
the Bible. However, the other references do not relate to him in the
slightest; (1) doesn’t because it specifically says he had five disciples and
not the 12 mentioned in the Gospels, and (8) doesn’t relate to him because it
says that Mary slept with a soldier named Pantera–thus making Jesus his
bastard son rather than someone born of a virgin. Number seven speaks of a
Jesus who was stoned and then hanged. The Gospels do not corroborate the
stoning account in Sanhedrin 43. It is obvious that Christians are biased when
appealing to this source. Scholars are divided concerning the relationship
these references have to a historical Jesus. Moreover, they consider the
passages to be a response to Christian proselytism.

a God, He loves you and, unlike nothingness, He makes people VERY happy. Join
the fun! You have NOTHING to loose but your pain and self-doubt. Trust me,
whether or not you want to believe it (or, more likely, whether you’ve been
told otherwise) you ARE worthy of being created by an Almighty God who
literally loves you. Just open your HEART to His love and you’ll be happy too!
It’s that simple. God bless and good luck.

This is the arguably the primary reason they’re historically unreliable: they
don’t even qualify as historical accounts in the first place. If we cannot
establish that these are historical accounts, then we can’t even begin to talk
about whether they’re historically reliable. It stands to reason that they
have to be proven historical texts before we begin to have a conversation
about whether the text honors what actually took place and whether it
adequately explains and interprets these events. A Christian can claim, for
example, that Jesus walking on water is the “truth claim.” Yet this doesn’t
read as a historical account, much less a reliable one. We have an isolated
event that is told in a story-like manner in where the writer narrates his
account from an omniscient point of view. There is no investigation, no
explanation of why this happened, and no plausible interpretation for this
rare feat.

I’m sure Christians think the consensus says otherwise, since many of them
seem to have done nothing but indulge their confirmation bias and read what
conservative Christian scholars have had to say about this matter. Like the
evangelists and first readers, these scholars want to confirm the Christian
faith. They never intended to conduct honest research. For starters, had they
actually intended to conduct honest research, in starting from the assumption
that the Gospels are historically reliable, they would have quickly come to
find out that the Gospels are not historically reliable at all.

What they have done is compare the Gospels to written histories that are
contemporary and by contemporary, I mean written histories during the time of
the Gospels, before their time, and shortly after. Philo and Josephus are much
more rigorous.

No it doesn’t. To chase this red herring would be a mistake on my part. You’re
too misinformed to correct. I was making a point about scholarly consensus and
not necessarily about the Big Bang.

The very first time I was the use of BCE was 25 years ago in a museum in
Israel. This is were it began and the motivation for its use is self-evident.
Anti-Christian fervor.

The problem is the Christian’s starting point. Their claim is fixed and is
therefore the “truth claim.” They then try to find only that evidence which
seems to agree with their presumed conclusion. This is confirmation bias. This
is what I mean when I call someone intellectually dishonest. They do not
research first and then conclude. They draw a comforting conclusion and then
seek evidence; some don’t even care about evidence or change the meaning of
evidence so that it is easier for them to disqualify unfavorable facts. At any
rate, the authorship of the Gospels is a settled matter: the Gospels are
anonymous works and aside from the pretended expertise of layman and the books
of dishonest apologists like Lee Strobel, there’s no way around that.

Even conservative scholars like Craig Blomberg accept this conclusion, so if
you’re the type of Christian to bypass that and say the Gospels were written
by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, you might as well continue in your
delusions. The related delusion is that these accounts were written by
eyewitnesses. It is also a matter of consensus that the Gospels were not
written by eyewitnesses. Bart Ehrman puts it succinctly:

The fact remains that there’s no external attestation. Pliny, for instance,
confirms that Tacitus wrote _Historae_. No one confirms that Mark, for
instance, wrote the Gospel of Mark. A lot more can be said on this topic and
since I do not consider myself an authority on this topic, I’d advise
Christians to read Ferguson’s “Why Scholars Doubt the Traditional Authors of
the Gospels” and also Keith Reich’s [series on Gospel
Authorship](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fkeithreich.blogspot.com%2F2015%2F09%2Fgospel-

He has a Ph.D. in Religion/Focus New Testament from Baylor University.

Short on facts and yet, some 50% of the writing is from outside sources. I
guess you didn’t read the post at all. You read the title and threw a tantrum.

One thing at a time.  
Okay?  
The Big Bang acctually supports the Biblical claim that God created
everything.  
You know about fine tuning, right?

That last point speaks to the exact genre of the Gospels. As they stand, they
are mythological hagiographies. As a point of comparison, Ferguson goes on to
speak of Alexander the Great, since myths about him became ubiquitous shortly
after his death.

We have numerous images of Julius Cesar, including stamped coins. Do we have a
single image (or even physical description) of Jesus?

The following is Roman historian Suetonius’ reference: “Claudius Judaeos
impulsore Chresto assidue tumultuantes Roma expulit (Life of Claudius, 110
CE).” The translation is: “Claudius drove the Jews out of Rome, who at the
suggestion of Chrestus were constantly rioting.” The reference doesn’t say
Christus. It clearly says Chrestus. However, Jesus could not have been alive
at this time because Claudius reigned from the years 41-54. Christians believe
that Christ was crucified in the year 33 C.E. Thus, if he existed, he was not
alive at this time and therefore, the passage isn’t referring to the Gospel
Jesus or the individual he was based on. Like the previous three, it does
nothing to establish his divinity.

And why would I think other histories are myth if they can be corroborated?
The Jewish origin tale has been known to be myth for nearly three generations
now. This is not new information. Did you know that in 1998, the American
Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR), the primary American professional body
for archaeologists working in the Middle East, changed the name of its
magazine from Biblical Archaeologist to Near Eastern Archaeology simply
because the bible had been determined to be (beyond all doubt) an entirely
unreliable historical source to direct research into the early Jews, pre-
Babylonian captivity.

There were no independent sources that predate the gospels that speak of Jesus
because they had to wait for Him to be born and rise form the dead first!

To your first question, we can’t. However, the scholars I cited are not
holding them to today’s standards. In fact, today’s standards are different,
far and wide. Let’s consider why.

Good Lord! How hopeless and depressing your baseless, non-Chistian beliefs
are! Changing the name of a society means nothing more than it was overrun by
non-believers, just as has been the case during the last 50 years, with most
“academic” organizations. They are now nothing more than shams. Their
“consensus” only proves that they have an anti-Christian agenda, and nothing
more.

In any case, scholarly consensus is not like demographics. These demographics
you speak of are about non-belief; when scholars come to a consensus, they’re
agreeing on what constitutes knowledge rather than belief or lack thereof. The
consensus is that evolution is a well-supported theory in science; the same is
said of the Big Bang. The consensus is that the historical evidence for the
Gospel Jesus is severely lacking; in fact, it’s just not available at all.
Also, if your comment was intelligent, you would have been able to anticipate
my response, namely that Islam is the world’s fastest growing religion. So if
you really want to disingenuously conflate demographics with scholarly
consensus, you have to admit that what your belief isn’t true either. You’ve
mistaken consensus for an argument from popularity. They’re not the same
thing.

Conjecture. Short on facts means you will be long on conjecture in an attempt
to prove a point.

I find it laughable that you think I should respond to this condescension. You
obviously didn’t read what I wrote because you’re still assuming the writers
of the Gospels were eyewitnesses. And you’re assuming skeptics and atheists
are disgruntled humans, and that I’m further down the food chain. So you’re
insulting me right off the bat. Now go have a great day because there’s no god
to love you. He doesn’t exist.

Scholars generally consider this passage to be both authentic and historically
reliable. However, there are some issues with this source, namely that the
passage may have been hearsay. R.T. France states that Tacitus repeated what
he heard from Christians. More specifically, he stated:

To find out why this is the case, we need to discuss authorship, genre,
external attestation, and internal consistency. If we want to find out whether
we have a historically reliable piece of ancient writing, authorship is
important. The Gospels are a curious case already because unlike the writings
of ancient historians, the Gospels are, strictly speaking, anonymous.2 In the
same vein, the genre of the Gospels has to be called into question because
they’re not written as history. Furthermore, it doesn’t seem they were written
as biographies. Even if we allow the assumptions that they were ancient
biographies and are historically reliable, we’d still require external
attestation–especially for the more fantastical bits found in the Gospels,
e.g., Jesus walking on water. Also, if we allow for these assumptions, we’d
want to see if the Gospels are internally consistent, i.e., do the Gospels
cohere with one another. Once we discuss these points, we’ll arrive at the
honest conclusion that the Gospels are historically unreliable.

I can definitely go there. Might have to wait till the weekend though.

To demonstrate why the Gospels aren’t internally consistent, I need only
present a series of examples. No Christian to date has solved this conundrum
and that’s because they simply can’t. Bock’s harmonizing tactics don’t work
because in many of these cases, it makes for one heck of a confused narrative.

Did Jesus carry the cross the entire way or did Simon of Cyrene carry it for
him; _Mark 15:21_ or _Luke 23:26_ and _John 19:17_? Did one robber mock him or
did both; _Matthew 27:44_ or _Luke 23:39-40_? Did the curtain rip before or
after; _Mark 15:37-38_ or _Luke 23:45-46_? Who went to the tomb–did Mary
Magdalene go alone or did she have company and if so, how much company; _Mark
16:1-3_ (Mary Magdalene goes with Mary and Salome) or _Matthew 28:1_ (Mary
Magdalene goes with just Mary) or _John 20:1_ (she goes alone)? Was there one
man or one angel in the tomb ( _Mark 16:5_ or _Matthew 28:2-3_ ) or were there
two men or two angels ( _Luke 24:4_ or _John 20:11-12_ )? Was the stone rolled
away or not; _Mark 16:3-4_ or _Matthew 28:2_? Where’s this earthquake in the
other Gospels by the way? Were the disciples to stay in Jerusalem or were they
to go to Galilee ( _Mark 16:7_ and _Matthew 28:7_ or the silence of Luke and
John on whether or not to go to Galilee)? Did the women tell the disciples or
did they stay silent? As Ehrman says, it depends which Gospel you read.

And, when many were fully convinced by these words, and offered praise for the
testimony of James, and said, “Hosanna to the son of David,” then 30.
Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History 2.23.3–18 (SC 31:86–90; trans. NPNF2 1:207–8,
modified; my emphasis). again the Pharisees and scribes said to one another,
“We have not done well in procuring this testimony to Jesus. But let us go up
and throw him down, that they may be afraid, and not believe him.” And they
cried aloud, and said, “Oh! Oh! The just man himself is in error.” Thus they
fulfilled the Scripture written in Isaiah: “Let us away with the just man,
because he is troublesome to us: therefore shall they eat the fruit of their
doings.” So they went up and threw down the just man, and said to one another,
“Let us stone James the Just.” And they began to stone him, for he was not
killed by the fall; but he turned, and kneeled down, and said, “I beseech
Thee, Lord God our Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.”

If you are who I think you are, I blocked you because you’re snarky and there
can’t be a productive conversation between us. If you were kind enough to
provide me with an email address, I’ll send you a screenshot, which says
“Comment Blocked: Your comment could not be posted. We restrict certain
content and actions to protect our community. Tell us if you think we made a
mistake.” To protect our community? In other words, to protect oversensitive
believers from valid criticism. Rest assured, I cannot comment on that HONY
post anymore. Plenty of other people tagged me in responses and I was
powerless to respond to them; Christians have a long history of silencing
their opponents. I’m just glad they can no longer put me to death. Silence me
on a meaningless Instagram post, but you can’t silence me here nor will you
silence me when I write books countering your beliefs.

“Confirming Christian faith” is also squishy. “The witnesses’ aim was to
confirm that he saw the accused murder the deceased” may be entirely true,
without in any way impugning his or her testimony. People often try to
convince others because they themselves have been convinced: that is not
inherently irrational or unholy.

He also concludes that the passage was likely speaking of Jesus ben Damneus
and his brother James. Ananus ordered that James be stoned to death; Ananus
was soon replaced by Jesus ben Damneus–perhaps a punishment for killing an
innocent man. Josephus discusses this in the same narrative a few lines after
purportedly mentioning “James the Just” who was “the brother of Jesus who was
called the Christ.“ Therefore, it is highly probable that he originally spoke
of Jesus ben Damneus and his brother James. This is a well-supported
conclusion–especially when considering that the death by stoning of “James the
Just” is not corroborated anywhere else. Hegesippus wrote a myth concerning
the stoning of James; however, this myth is markedly different. In this myth,
James the Just is thrown from the roof of a temple and then stoned; however,
that doesn’t result in his death. He dies when he is struck in the head with a
staff.15 Also, there is no mention of Ananus, and that is perhaps the key
difference.

The aforesaid scribes and Pharisees accordingly set James on the summit of the
Temple, and cried aloud to him, and said, “O just one, whom we are all bound
to obey, forasmuch as the people are in error, and follow Jesus the crucified,
do tell us what is the door of Jesus, the crucified.” And he answered with a
loud voice, “Why ask me concerning Jesus the Son of Man? He Himself sits in
heaven, at the right hand of the great power, and shall come on the clouds of
heaven.”

I brought it and made easy work of your “challenges.” Congratulations, you are
now prohibited from commenting on my blog. 🙂

In any case, anyone willing to be honest would see that the story of Jesus
walking on water isn’t historical. It’s not based in fact nor is there any
evidence to support that claim. To the contrary, there is incontrovertible
evidence to support what I’ve offered here–even a charitable interpretation
available to Christians. That the story of Jesus walking on water was meant to
be considered an allegory in no way implies that they should renounce their
beliefs altogether; it in no way implies that Christianity is false. In fact,
there are plenty of Christians who favor this interpretation and have no issue
with its ahistorical content. Or perhaps, to their mind, it isn’t even an
attempt at historical retelling; it’s, in other words, non-historical since
the story wasn’t meant to be read that way.

Right away, if we call to mind the content of the Gospels, we will quickly
notice that the Gospels meet none of these criteria. They don’t accurately
represent the past events in question. In fact, the Gospels embellish and
mythologize and thus, make it quite difficult to find the historical tidbits
contained within them. They also do not investigate these events or offer
plausible interpretations of what happened. More specifically, they don’t
explain how or why a given event happened. Ferguson continues:

Josephus does mention the imprisonment and death of John the Baptist, but he
disagrees with the Gospels on some details, e.g., why he was killed; where he
was imprisoned. Ultimately, the historicity of John’s baptisms doesn’t imply
that he baptized Jesus. Historical people and places are commonly incorporated
into myths, e.g., Darius I in the book of Daniel; Pharaoh (which one?) in
Exodus. Therefore, it is our right to ignore Josephus’ mention of John the
Baptist given these reasons.

As stated earlier, we cannot have external attestation of Jesus walking on
water. According to the myth, it happened during a storm, so there’s no
conceivable way an ancient historian would have been out in the storm seeing
this all unfold. One might argue, however, that there is historical
attestation for the existence of Jesus. In this section, I simply want to
throw the external attestations into disarray. I, in other words, want
Christians to question Josephus, Tacitus, Suetonius, and so on. I want them to
realize that these external attestations aren’t as reliable as they’ve been
led to believe.

Aside from this, since the original manuscripts aren’t available, we don’t
know whether these titles were original to the text. Bart Ehrman explains that
the titles can’t be traced back to the original manuscripts and that it is
highly likely that the titles were added afterward by scribes.7

No wonder your comments are so short because you actually have no points to
make. You just want to make believe you’re doing the work of the lord by
defending your faith. Try harder.

Now, that the Gospels don’t discuss their sources is valid because, unlike the
Iliad, Christians are claiming that the Gospels record history; they say the
same of Acts. A lot of their contents are fantastical, so the corroborative
sources would have to attest to that. Yet they don’t. Philo, a contemporary of
Jesus, says nothing about him. Josephus says next to nothing. There were
historians, polemicists, poets, satirists and so on who were his
contemporaries and their silence is curious given what the Gospels say. We can
get into the fact that these Gospels are the proto-Orthodox favorites that
endured; there were many more gospels in the first century, a lot of which
stemmed from gnosticism. If the Gospel Jesus was historical, Christianity
would have been absolutely clearcut. Yet Paul talks about his opponents,
especially in Corinthians and Colossians; that speaks to how many different
versions we already had just a mere 20 years after his death. These are all
points that have their own scholarly underpinnings.

This would no doubt be of interest had it been written about closer to the
event. Unfortunately, the consensus is that Thallus wrote in the second
century. Richard Carrier states:

Which Caesar? You don’t specify and you expect me to think of you as informed?

  8. February 27, 2016 - 1:49 am Pingback: [The Gospels Are Reliable and the Gospel Jesus is a Historical Person |](http://www.stephenjbedard.com/the-gospels-are-reliable-and-the-gospel-jesus-is-a-historical-person/)

You know a writer in trouble when he starts off with Matthew Ferguson:

Isn’t that what you’re doing by making stupid comments on blogs you don’t
like? If you don’t like the content, you can simply leave. Honestly, if you
don’t have anything intelligent to contribute in these comments, I’ll simply
stop approving them.

Ultimately, my purpose was to demonstrate the historical unreliability of the
Gospels and by extension, the non-historicity of the _Gospel_ Jesus. That’s
the Jesus modern Christians need to exist in order for them to assert that
their beliefs are true. These two claims are absolutely essential to
Christianity and no amount of pseudo-philosophical language can change that.
Some Christians may be, for instance, of the Van Tillian flavor and argue that
I need to either firmly establish my entire epistemology or debase their
epistemology in order to make my claims. They’re essentially moving the
goalposts and making Christianity as abstract as possible, so that it is
easier to sidestep the questions I’ve just answered.

Not a tantrum. An equal response to your assertion.  
Right off the beginning, you assert :  
“Are the Gospels historically reliable? The answer is a resounding no and this
much is admitted by the consensus:”

Stupid question. There is the total number of protein molecules per cell and
the number of different proteins in a cell. Your question makes no sense.
You’re just trying hard to make me believe you’re intelligent. Still a red
herring because it has absolutely nothing to do with my post.

By the way, I read your post, word for word. It contains a number of egregious
errors. Your “errors” are nothing but wishful thinking. I guess I’ll get
around to responding to the tripe this weekend.

Wow. You whined already. After your first obscene set of “errors,” I knew
better than to respond. I won’t be approving any further comments from you.
You’re so desperate for content on your blog that you need to “refute” what
other bloggers produce. Pathetic.

They came, therefore, in a body to James, and said, “We entreat you, restrain
the people: for they are gone astray in their opinions about Jesus, as if he
were the Christ. We entreat you to persuade all who have come here for the day
of the Passover, concerning Jesus. For we all listen to you; since we, as well
as all the people, bear you testimony that you are just, and show partiality
to none. Therefore, persuade the people not to entertain erroneous opinions
concerning Jesus: for all the people, and we also, listen to you. Take your
stand, then, upon the summit of the Temple, that from that elevated spot you
may be clearly seen, and your words may be plainly audible to all the people.
For, in order to attend the Passover, all the tribes have congregated here,
and some of the Gentiles also.”

Sure, I went a step further: I stated that Christianity isn’t true. When you
consider that there’s no historical evidence for the Jesus in the Gospels and
more importantly, his resurrection and ascension, the conclusion is
inescapable. From the Apostle’s Creed to the Nicene Creed, the common
denominators are the historicity of the Gospel Jesus (not just any Jesus), his
resurrection, and his ascension to the right hand of the father. These are
simply beliefs and not historical facts, which is a glaring problem for your
religion whether you admit it or not.

No. You only have a setting of writings written 30-90 years after the alleged
events. Everything else written is based upon that. King Herod died 10 years
before the census. Both events are documented. The gospels are written
“according to” this means whoever wrote it down is disowning authorship. Do
other independent sources that predate the “gospels” speak of jesus or his
teachings?

“Studies on the demographics of atheism have concluded that self-identified
atheistscomprise anywhere from 2% to 13% of the world’s population, whereas
people without a religion (atheism isn’t a religion) comprise anywhere from
10% to 22% of the world’s population.[1][2][3][4] Several polls have been
conducted by Gallup International: in their 2012 poll of 57 countries, 13% of
respondents were “convinced atheists” and in their 2015 poll of 65 countries
11% were “convinced atheists”.[4][5] In Scandinavia, the Netherlandsand East
Asia, and particularly in China, atheists and the nonreligious are the
majority.[5] Of the global atheist and nonreligious population, 76% reside in
Asia and the Pacific, while the remainder reside in Europe (12%), North
America (5%), Latin America and the Caribbean (4%), sub-Saharan Africa (2%)
and the Middle East and North Africa (less than 1%).[3] In Africa and South
America, atheists are typically in the single digits.[5] According to Pew
Research Center’s 2012 global study of 230 countries and territories, 16% of
the world’s population is not affiliated with a religion, while 84% are
affiliated.[6] Furthermore, the global study noted that many of the

Are the Gospels historically reliable? The answer is a resounding no and this
much is admitted by the consensus:

K.Q., you didn’t challenge anything about my post. You made one assertion
after another, and all of them were thoroughly dealt with. Upon dealing with
them, you proceeded to throw a tantrum. This isn’t a debate, since a debate
implies two or more participants that a) are willing to listen to one another
b) are knowledgeable about the topic at hand. You’ve failed in both respects.
The post isn’t my area of expertise, but the experts are cited in the post;
you’ve dealt with absolutely none of what they said. The only untenable
opinions here are yours.

Yes. It’s a proven fraud. This is a red herring and has nothing to do with my
post. The only people who think the Shroud is authentic are Catholics.
Protestants, Lutherans, and Orthodox Christians don’t give a donkey’s behind
about the shroud. Facts hurt, I know.

Persecution complex? I don’t think so. So when pressed, you shut down the
debate? That just proves my point. Indefensible opinion is your area of

And, while they were thus stoning him to death, one of the priests of the sons
of Rechab, the son of the Rechabites, to whom testimony is born by Jeremiah
the prophet, began to cry aloud, saying, “Stop! What are you doing!? The just
man is praying for us.” But one among them, one of the fullers, took the staff
with which he was accustomed to wring out the garments he dyed, and hurled it
at the head of the just man.

We all know you have a hard on for Matthew Ferguson. I’ve spoken to you before
and don’t enjoy it. In your delusions, you might think it’s because you’re so
intelligent and informed; you’re not. Loftus and Ferguson have dealt with you
rather handily. I’ll leave it to my readers to go check out your blog and
theirs to see what I’m talking about. I’m not going to be another atheist you
add to your list to stalk and smear. This will be the only comment I approve.
The rest of your comments will be trashed without consideration. Go whine
about it on your blog the way you always do. 🙂

Besides, Ben Stein has Dawkins admitting he thinks DNA information had to
originate from a source outside the evolutionary process.  
There is no model in nature for adding information, let alone 3.2 billion bits
of genetic information we find in each strand of human DNA.

Also, keep in mind, I am not saying there wasn’t a historical Jesus, i.e., a
person on whom the Gospel figure was based on. What I am saying is that the
historical Jesus was not the Gospel Jesus, which is the same as saying that
Jesus–as depicted in the Gospels–is not a historical person. This isn’t a
strange argument because other than really conservative scholars and
apologists, no one can honestly make that claim after considering the sources
available. It is, however, a central claim in Christianity. To my mind, for
Christianity to be true, it is necessary that the Gospel Jesus be historical
and if you really want to get technical, it is necessary for the Jesus
featured in the Gospel of John to be historical. That technicality leads to
problems, not least of which being that the Gospel of John was written some
60-70 years after his death.

There isn’t much debate about it’s authenticity. Christian apologists will
have us believe that, but there have been a few nails in this coffin for quite
some time. Richard Carrier put the last nail in the coffin with his paper,
_Origen, Eusebius, and the Accidental Interpolation in Josephus_. Before we go
there, allow me to quote Carrier who speaks of another important paper that
Christians will likely never read:

Given what’s outlined above, the authorship and genre of the Gospels are
dubious. In other words, we don’t know who the authors actually were.
Furthermore, despite Christian pretenses, they aren’t historical texts or
biographies. They are embellished hagiographies that are littered with myths.
There’s also no external attestation or corroboration of any of the more
fantastical elements in the Gospels; also, corroboration of the more grounded
elements are questionable. To top it all off, the Gospels do not cohere with
one another in a few key places. So aside from the fact that Jesus did not
walk on water, Jesus didn’t do anything the Gospels say he did. The Christian
must either a) provide warrant for their opinion; b) provide justification for
their opinion; or c) demonstrate that their opinion aligns most closely to the
facts or is a reiteration of some truth. In this case, their opinion is
untenable.

which is a feature of more historical and scholarly biographies. Instead, like
the popular biographies of Homer, Aesop, and Alexander the Great, they are
less critical, more hagiographical, and include more legends and myth-
making.10

In addition, there is a great deal of evidence (Bauckham, Marshall) that the
gospels DO present eyewitness accounts.

The last sentence is another non sequitur. Jesus’ disciples were young,
certainly, and could easily have lived until the date at which the gospels
were written. I KNOW people in similiar situations who witness to events they
saw 70 years ago in their youths (World War II vets, etc) — plus Mark may have
been written rather earlier.

No wonder your post had to be so long. Because it’s short on facts, it must be
long on conjecture.  
Typical.

For starters, Christians who think that the miraculous acts found in the
Gospels are historical are confronted by an unfavorable fact: none of the
extra-biblical sources confirm _any_ of Jesus’ miracles. My purposes here
aren’t so much to show that they fail to mention any of his miraculous acts,
but that they might also fail to mention him altogether.

In any case, here’s a great article for you to consider. Apologists are lying
to you.

The pretentious fool could have commented under my Argument From Cosmology; he
didn’t. Perhaps he saw the breadth of my posts and realized that he’s in over
his head. In any case, that’s not a rebuttal; that’s mere disagreement with a
misreading of my conclusion. “I doubt you’re more advanced than me,” the
arrogant fool said. That’s why I blocked him too; I don’t deal with
pretentious undergrads who think they know it all. He doesn’t reach my toes in
philosophy and I just showed you that.

The Gospels operated, at least originally, more as “open texts,” since much of
their content was adapted and reworked into later versions. For example, the
Gospel of Matthew borrows from as much as 80% of the verses in Mark, and Luke
likewise borrows from 65% of the material in Mark. This is not typical of
historical and scholarly biographies, which had greater authorial control,
such as those of Plutarch, who does not merely copy his material from earlier
works.

This is a false dichotomy. “Historical analysis” is not the same as
“historically true writing about the past,” which the evangelists DID aim at.
They were not academic historians, but that does not mean they were freely
making stuff up, either. Ferguson makes a big deal about tendatious
differences between the genre of history and the genre of gospel out of
intellectual confusion.

I posted an essay a while back documenting a couple dozen obvious — repeat,
obvious! — falsehoods in his book about the new atheism, and Marshall
responded to some of those allegations by simply conjuring up even more
falsehoods, some of which were even more blatant than his original falsehood.
It’s like Marshall was *trying* to look dishonest.

I have refuted quite a few claims by Ferguson and Carrier at
christthetao.blogspot.com, and will add more in my new book. It isn’t hard.
Nor, for that matter, is rebutting Ehrman, who is often remarkably sloppy when
he has a point to make. The normal response, to which I have become rather
accustomed from some quarters (I don’t mean from Ehrman), is a stream of
personal insults. But the facts are stubborn things.

Consensus? That’s your justification for calling 5000 years of recorded
history a lie? The better question is, “Were you there?” If not, you have less
historical documentation from which to make your assumptions about Christ’s
life than the average local minister. You have absolutely nothing to prove you
are correct other than the writings of modern day cynics, unbelievers,
skeptics and other assorted disgruntled humans. This is hardly the kind of
“proof” that any reasonable person could use and still come to your
conclusions. And certainly their writings are nothing of value to anyone who
is seriously seeking the truth because most begin with personal assumptions
based on their own “feelings” versus the eyewitness accounts of the 12 men who
lived with Jesus, 11 of whom were viciously martyred, rather than deny their
faith in Christ as the Son of God. You are in no position to have any opinion
on these matters as you are even farther down the food chain than those you so
blithely quote. God is good. That’s all you need to know. Now go and have a
wonderful day because God loves you too.

[The Gospels are anonymous in the

just like the popular biographies of Homer, Aesop, and Alexander.

This is more or less the smoking gun. If we have either of these, but
preferably both, we have no reason to doubt the authorship of the text. To go
with an example you’re no doubt familiar with, no one can reasonably doubt the
authorship of the authentic Pauline Epistles: 1 and 2 Corinthians , Galatians,
Philemon, Philippians, Romans, and 1 Thessalonians. This can’t be reasonably
doubted because Paul identifies himself within the text. Yet the ones that are
doubted– Ephesians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians, Hebrews, 1 and 2 Timothy, and
Titus–are doubted for one of the reasons cited above. The non-authentic
Pauline Epistles are written in a palpably different style that doesn’t match
the style of the authentic ones. That there are only seven authentic Pauline
Epistles is a matter of scholarly consensus as well. Ephesians was and still
is disputed, but it is likelier that Ephesians is not authentic.

Aside from that, there is absolutely zero outside attestation of this event.
There can’t be any because this anonymous writer is telling a story that
conveniently took place in a storm. Therefore, no one could have seen it
happen and thus, there cannot be any extra-biblical attestation. There’s a
much more plausible explanation for this story and I’ll be sure to return to
this later, but as far as the historical reliability of this story, it is safe
to conclude it was dead on arrival. The notion that Jesus actually walked on
water is beyond laughable in any circle outside of one comprised of deluded
believers. Furthermore, there’s no research they will find to adequately
defend their view. They are, in other words, left with no warrant or
justification for holding said view. They are therefore left with no claim to
the truth or factuality of their claim, not just for the miracle in question,
but also for the other miracles mentioned in the Gospels.

Your question is loaded. I can, like others have, write an essay about why
evil exists. I can talk about small amygdalae in vicious criminals, child
abuse, economic pressures, etc. It goes far beyond people “choosing” to do
evil. So by extension, if I felt you were capable of actually listening to me,
I would debase the Libertarian free will you’re depending on to make your
case. And Christianity isn’t a forced religion? Do Christians not prey on the
vulnerable? Are you not mandated to spread the Gospel? Worst infraction of
all, do you not brainwash children–i.e., teach them *what* to think rather
than *how* to think? As for your last sentence, that’s a straw man. You’re
assuming I agree with that line of thinking. I don’t.

Stop the preaching. Been there, done that. Christianity is false. Your preachy
nonsense doesn’t work on me. I don’t think with my heart; no one does. I’m
happy and confident and perhaps to a degree greater than you are. Don’t assume
things about me because I don’t believe as you do. It’s condescending. Keep
that up and I’ll be sure to delete every comment you submit. You may not see
it as such, but assuming that much is disrespectful.

Of course, there are many other sources according to apologetic sites, but
like the above, which are the most commonly cited, they are all problematic.
More importantly, none of them establish Jesus’ divinity; none of them attest
to his miracles and fantastical acts.

That’s ridiculous! Under that guise, you could declare that ALL written
history was a geographical myth or a figment of someone’s imagination. Sorry,
that doesn’t fly! FYI. The Sumerians of Mesopotamia, which included Jews, were
first to emerge in recorded history in 3500 BC (BTW, only non-Christians use
BCE. It’s use is just another pathetic, transparent, and disingenuous ploy, by
unbelievers, to diminish Christ’s importance as the central figure to all of
human history), was 5000 years ago. I guess you didn’t know that.

And even if Rabbis weren’t, archaeology does not corroborate the kingdoms of
David and Solomon. It doesn’t help us locate historical Patriarchs. It also
doesn’t corroborate the battle at Jericho, as accounted in the Bible. As
stated, only after Kings do we get anything of historical value.

Atheist here. I wonder, can we claim something is not historical because
author does not write historically by today’s standards? The Iliad is written
completely in verse and does not criticise history. These two developments are
concreted in Western historiography by of Ranke and Hegel. So is the critic
such as, ‘The Gospels do not discuss their sources or methodology’ valid?

I guess you didn’t know that your “history” is church myth. Only non-
Christians use BCE? So I guess the professors that identify as Christians are
actually non-Christians in secret. Do yourself the favor of coming here to
learn rather than impose unsubstantiated belief. This isn’t your church. There
are a few informed people respectfully expressing historical and archaeology
facts. Saying “nuh uh, you’re trying to diminish Christ’s importance” is
simply closed-minded. If that’s how you are and you wish to remain that way,
stop commenting.

“Neither the evangelists nor their first readers engaged in historical
analysis.”  
I think my analysis matched your the arrogance of such an outrageous
assertion.  
You obviously are extremely biased.  
Later

This isn’t an intelligent comment. Wikipedia is not a good source as it is
often out of date and it is written and edited by, general speaking, everyday
people.

You’re still not convinced because you’re an obstinate believer. It’s not that
the arguments aren’t good; it’s not that you can refute the scholarship cited;
it’s not that you can make a better case for the historical reliability of the
Gospels and the existence of the Gospel Jesus; it’s that you’ll reject
anything that counters your beliefs. I must be wrong because you’ve already
found the “truth.” You can’t find what you haven’t sought.

In fact, this sort of figurative talk for so called trials and tribulations is
alive and well in the modern day. Christians still talk about deserts and
storms when speaking of their problems or tests of faith. In fact, the story
of Jesus walking on water is often used in one sermon after another in
relation to the struggles one is currently facing. The disciples represent the
Christian. They are, in other words, alone and helpless. Though they have each
other’s company, none of them can stop what comes next. The congregation can’t
exactly help the Christian out of their current jam. But along comes Christ as
a phantom on the stormy sea; he has come to rescue them and get them out of
the jam. I can’t for the life of me see how anyone would come to read this
story literally and consider it a piece of historical retelling.

Though there is a clear issue in identifying biographies in the Greco-Roman
period, as with the criteria of historical texts, the Gospels also fail to
match the criteria of historical biography in that period. The reasoning here
is quite involved and once again, I’d advise Christians to read Ferguson’s
“Are the Gospels Biographies?: The Spectrum of Ancient Βίοι,” which is cited
below. For our purposes though, it is useful to note Ferguson’s observations
concerning the type of biographies the Gospels attempt to be–namely ones that
focus on Jesus’ moral character and personality:

To reinforce my point, I am going to quote Mackie and Le Poidevin’s
refutations of contingency arguments like Rasmussen’s. It should then become
clear that we have to bury these kinds of arguments for good. Let them who are
attached to these arguments mourn their loss, but I will attend no such wake.
What remains of the body is an ancient skeleton, long dead. It is high time to
give it a rest. Le Poidevin put one nail in the coffin of contingency
arguments. Anyone offering new contingency arguments has simply failed to do
their homework. It is typical of Christian Theists to indulge confirmation
bias and avoid what their opponents have to say. The problem with that is that
the case against contingency arguments has been made. Obstinacy does not
change the fact. Le Poidevin clearly shows why necessary facts do not explain
contingent ones:

> The principle of sufficient reason, then, is more far-reaching than the
> principle that every occurrence has a preceding sufficient cause: the
> latter, but not the former, would be satisfied by a series of things or
> events running back infinitely in time, each determined by earlier ones, but
> with no further explanation of the series as a whole. Such a series would
> give us only what Leibniz called ‘physical’ or ‘hypothetical’ necessity,
> whereas the demand for a sufficient reason for the whole body of contingent
> things and events and laws calls for something with ‘absolute’ or

In any case, the real issue is that chair and iPhone shapes are not the sort
of shapes that occur naturally in the universe. Those shapes, namely spheres,
ellipses, triangles, and so on, also emerge from physical necessity. It is
simply the case that a suspender on a bridge forms the hypothenuse of a right
triangle. Like a chair, bridge suspenders take this shape because of physical
necessity. The same applies to the ubiquity of spherical and elliptical shapes
in the universe. To further disabuse anyone of Platonic ideas, globular shapes
are also quite ubiquitous in the universe and are more prominent the closer we
get to the Big Bang. There are shapes inherent in our universe that cannot be
neatly called _geometrical_ and even still, these shapes are physically and
therefore, metaphysically necessitated. If JR2 is unsound, then the argument
falls apart. On another front, this addresses Rasmussen’s assertion that God
explains why there is less chaos in our universe. Setting aside that the
qualification of this statement is entirely relative, the relative order we
see in the universe is entirely probabilistic, especially given that entropy
guarantees a trend toward disorder as the universe grows older and colder.

Of course, Leon is correct in his assessment. Why not Ahura Mazda, his
hypostatic union to Spenta Mainyu, and his extension via the Amesha Spentas?
If, for instance, the one-many problem requires the notion of a One that is
also many, what exactly rules out Ahura Mazda? One starts to see how the
prevailing version of Theism in philosophy of religion is just a sad force of
habit. This is why it is necessary to move on from these arguments.
Contingency arguments are notoriously outmoded because Mackie, Le Poidevin,
and others have already provided general defeaters that can apply to any
particular contingency argument. Also, how many contingency arguments do we
need exactly? In other words, how many different ways can one continue to
assert that all contingent things require at least one necessary explanation?
Wildman guides us here:

Like Leon, I take issue with JR2. Leon does not really elaborate on why JR2 is
questionable saying only that “the most basic entities with geometry (if such
there be) have their geometrics of factual or metaphysical necessity” and that
therefore, “it’s not true that every geometric state is dependent” (Ibid.,
67). He is correct, of course, but elaboration could have helped here because
this is a potential defeater. Factual and metaphysical necessity are inhered
in physical necessity. The universe is such that the fact that every triangle
containing a 90-degree angle is a right triangle is reducible to physical
constraints within our universe. This fact of geometry is unlike Rasmussen’s
examples, namely chair and iPhone shapes. He states: “The instantiation of [a
chair’s shape] depends upon prior conditions. Chair shapes never instantiate
_on their own_ , without any prior conditions. Instead, chair-instantiations
depend on something” (Ibid., 41). This overt Platonism is questionable in and
of itself, but Leon’s statement is forceful in this case: the shape of the
chair is not dependent because it has its shape of factual or metaphysical
necessity that stem from physical necessity. Chairs, first and foremost, are
shaped the way they are because of our shape when we sit down; furthermore,
chairs take the shapes they do because of physical constraints like human
weight, gravity, friction against a floor, etc. For a chair not to collapse
under the force of gravity and the weight of an individual, it has to be
engineered in some way to withstand these forces acting on it; the chair’s
shape is so because of physical necessity and this explains its metaphysical
necessity. There is therefore, no _form_ of a chair in some ethereal realm; an
idea like this is thoroughly retrograde and not worth considering.

Every contingency argument fails because it relies on the principle of
sufficient reason and because necessity does not cohere with contingency as it
concerns a so-called causal relation. Mackie, like Le Poidevin, also questions
why God is a satisfactory termination of the regress. Why not something
something else? (Ibid., 92). Contingency arguments amount to vicious special
pleading and an outright refusal to entertain viable alternatives, even in
cases where the alternatives are nonphysical and compatible with religious
sentiments. In any case, it would appear that the principle of sufficient
reason is not on stable ground. Neither is the notion that a necessary being
is the ultimate explanation of the universe. Contingency arguments have been
defeated and there really is no way to repeat these arguments in a way that
does not fall on the horns of Le Poidevin and Mackie’s defeaters. Only the
obdurate need to believe that God is the foundational explanation of the
universe explains the redundancy of Christian Theists within the philosophy of
religion. That is setting aside that apologetics is not philosophy and other
complaints I have had. The Geometric Argument, despite using different
language, _just is_ a contingency argument. If the dead horse could speak, it
would tell them all to lay down their batons once and for all, but alas.

  1. April 17, 2021 - 11:37 pm Pingback: [Skeptical Theism and New Arguments For Atheism | The Philosophy Corner](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/04/17/skeptical-theism-and-new-arguments-for-atheism/)

Rasmussen has _no_ argument called The Argument From Arbitrary Limits.
Arbitrary limits actually feature in Leon’s chapter in where he expresses
skepticism of Rasmussen’s Geometric Argument (Rasmussen Joshua and Leon,
Felipe. _Is God The Best Explanation For Things_. Switzerland: Palgrave
Macmillan. 53-68. Print.). Also, Rasmussen has a Theistic conception of God
(omnipresent, wholly good, etc.) that is analogous to what Plantinga means by
maximal greatness, but Rasmussen does not refer to God using that term.
Perhaps there is confusion with his use of the word _maximal_ _conceivabl_
_e_. While given Rasmussen’s beliefs, he implies God with what he calls a
maximal foundation, “a foundation _complete_ with respect to its fundamental
(basic, uncaused) features” (Ibid., 140). He makes it clear throughout the
book that he is open to such a foundation that is not synonymous with God. In
any case, his _maximal conceivable_ is _not_ a being possessing maximal
greatness; at least, not exactly, since it appears he means something more
elementary given his descriptions of basic and uncaused, as these clearly do
not refer to omnipresence, perfect goodness, and so on. There may also be some
confusion with his later argument, which he calls “The Maximal Mind Argument”
(Ibid. 112-113), which fails because it is relies heavily on nonphysicalism, a
series of negative theories in philosophy of mind that do not come close to
offering alternative explanations for an array of phenomena thoroughly
explained by physicalism (see
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/)). In any case, Rasmussen has
no argument resembling the graphic above. His arguments rest on a number of
dubious assumptions, the nexus of which is his Geometric Argument:

My purpose here is twofold: first and foremost, I want to clarify Rasmussen’s
argument because though I can understand why word of mouth can lead to what is
essentially a straw man of his argument, especially in light of the fact that
his argument requires one to pay for an online article or his book _Is God the
Best Explanation of Things?_ which he coauthored with Felipe Leon, it is
simply good practice to present an argument fairly. Secondly, I want to be
stern about the fact that philosophy of religion cannot continue to rake these
dead coals. Rasmussen’s argument is just another in a long, winding, and quite
frankly, tired history of contingency arguments. In in any case, the following
is the straw man I want my readers and anyone else who finds this post to stop
citing. This is decidedly _not_ Rasmussen’s argument:

> Necessary facts, then, cannot explain contingent ones, and causal
> explanation, of any phenomenon, must link contingent facts. That is, both
> cause and effect must be contingent. Why is this? Because causes make a
> difference to their environment: they result in something that would not
> have happened if the cause had not been present. To say, for example, that
> the presence of a catalyst in a certain set of circumstances speeded up a
> reaction is to say that, had the catalyst not been present in those
> circumstances, the reaction would have proceeded at a slower rate. In
> general, if A caused B, then, if A had not occurred in the circumstances, B
> would not have occurred either. (A variant of this principle is that, if A
> caused B, then if A had not occurred in the circumstances, the probability
> of B’s occurrence would have been appreciably less than it was. It does not

Ultimately, contingency arguments are yet another example of how repetitive
Christianized philosophy of religion has become. There is a sense in which
Leon, Le Poidevin, and Mackie are paraphrasing one another because, and here
is a bit of irony, like arguments result in like rebuttals. They cannot help
but to sound like they each decided or even conspired to write on the same
topic for a final paper. They are, after all, addressing the same argument no
matter how many attempts have been made to word it differently. It is a
vicious cycle, a large wheel that cannot keep on turning. It must be stopped
in its tracks if progress in the philosophy of religion is to get any real
traction.

Setting aside that Rasmussen does not make clear why he prefers a Christian
view of ultimacy as opposed to a Zoroastrian one or another one that may be
proposed, I think Wildman is being quite generous when saying that
“alternative metaphysical schemes fit the empirical facts just as well as the
preferred metaphysical scheme” because the fact of the matter is that some
alternatives fit the empirical facts _better than_ metaphysical schemes like
the ones Christian Theists resort to. Rasmussen’s preferred metaphysical
scheme of a maximal foundation, which properly stated, is a disembodied,
nonphysical mind who is omnipresent, wholly good, and so on rests on dubious
assumptions that have not been made to cohere with the empirical facts.
Nonphysicalism, as I have shown in the past, does not even attempt to explain
brain-related phenomena. Physicalist theories have trounced the opposition in
that department and it is not even close. What is more is that Christian
Theists are especially notorious for not comparing their account to other
accounts and that is because they are not doing philosophy, but rather
apologetics. This is precisely why philosophy of religion _must_ move on from
Christian Theism. We can think of an intellectual corollary to forgiveness. In
light of Christian Theism’s abject failure to prove God, how many more chances
are we required to give this view? Philosophy of religion is, then, like an
abused lover continuing to be moved by scraps of affection made to cover up
heaps of trauma. The field should be past the point of forgiveness and giving
Christian Theism yet another go to get things right; it has had literal
centuries to get its story straight and present compelling arguments and yet
here we are retreading ground that has been walked over again and again and
again.

This is a way of substantiating that an effect is inhered in a cause or the
principle, like effects from like causes. This has been precisely my criticism
of the idea that a nonphysical cause created the physical universe. There is
no theory of causation that permits the interaction of an ethereal entity’s
dispositions and that of physical things. It is essentially a paraphrase of
Elizabeth of Bohemia’s rebuttal to Cartesian dualism: how does mental
substance interact with physical substance? This is why mind-body dualism
remains in a state of incoherence, but I digress. Mackie puts yet another nail
in the coffin:

Like Leon, I share his general concern about “any argument that moves from
facts about apparent contingent particularity and an explicability principle
to conclusions about the nature of fundamental reality” (Ibid., 67) or as I
have been known to put it: one cannot draw ontological conclusions on the
basis of logical considerations. Theistic philosophers of religion and
unfortunately, philosophers in general, have a terrible habit of leaping from
conceivability to possibility and then, all the way to actuality. Leon
elaborates:

4\. The person falling in notices _no difference_ in how time passes or how
light appears to them. They would continue to fall in to the black hole and
cross the event horizon as though nothing happened. ([“Falling Into a Black
Hole Sucks!”](https://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/11/20/falling-
into-a-black-hole-suck). _ScienceBlogs_. 20 Nov 2009. Web.)

So came my idea of _virtual simultaneity_. From there, I would imagine a
parallel me, a sort of ghost, who in another universe got on the other bus and
I would imagine how far ahead of me he would be on his walk toward my
building. I would then speed up so that I would catch up to my parallel on my
way home as means to feel better about not having been on the bus that arrived
earlier. This is how I think about time, in a very intimate sense. Nothing
stops me in my tracks like an article about time. My mind could be furtherest
from time and from philosophy more generally, reading fan theories about a
show I am into or looking up the latest sports scores, and when scrolling, an
article about time shows up and I am immediately in that headspace. This was
the case two days ago when I read Musser’s article “A Defense of the Reality
of Time.”

1\. The light coming from the person gets redshifted; they’ll start to take on
a redder hue and then, eventually, will require infrared, microwave, and then
radio “vision” to see.

To pursue a brief tangent, not all theories of time think of time as a line.
Eternalists see time in one dimension, but their view of time is more in
keeping with a circle. Emery, et al. state:

To exhaust a well-known example, time moves faster at higher altitudes, the
further one is from the Earth’s center. This might be suggestive of time
behaving differently along the vertical axis. This also readily explains the
relative experiences of someone falling into a black hole and another person
seeing this happen. Recall the following:

I would highly recommend getting a handle of Pössel’s illustrations if you
would like to better understand how time and space trade places within a black
hole. For our purposes, the fact that this happens in a black hole might offer
a clue. Perhaps the lesson to be learned from the inner workings of blacks
holes is that time has more than one dimension. Maybe the relativity of time
inhered in General and Special Relativity has to do with the fact that time is
superimposed or even supervenes on space in a different way relative to one’s
direction in space. In other words, time has a horizontal behavior, so to
speak. It has a slightly different vertical behavior. Further still, it has
another behavior along curved or edged spaces within the dimension of depth.
On Earth, we commonly move as though we lived in two-dimensions, so thinking
of moving in a third dimension is difficult to conceptualize. We would have to
travel in space to get a better idea of how the effects of gravity, over long
distances, look like traveling along a curved surface. Or, we can simply think
of the difference between Mario on Super Nintendo versus Mario on the Nintendo
Switch. When Mario performs any movements in the depth dimension, or to add to
our x- and y-axes, a z-axis, he is now covering diagonal domains analogous to
the width of a cube, for instance.

Consider, as an example, the b-moments in Friedrich Nietzsche’s life.
Friedrich Nietzsche’s birth on October 15, 1844 is one b-moment and his death
on August 25, 1900 is another. The dates of both represent distinct b-times.
On TPT, he is spread out from October 15, 1844 to August 25, 1900. If we were
to depict him in a space-time diagram, his parts on our diagram will depict
his temporal parts. If we were capable of watching Nietzsche in his infancy,
we will be observing a temporal part, then another that resembles it, and then
another. If one were to watch infant Nietzsche long enough, his later temporal
parts will be slightly bigger than the previous ones. That is to say that
Nietzsche is no longer an infant; he is now, for instance, a toddler. So on
our space-time diagram, Nietzsche grows the further we move away from his
birth. It is also worth noting that temporal parts have spatial parts and vice
versa. Nietzsche’s hand, like Nietzsche himself, persisted within the interval
of time his life occupies. The parts he was comprised of will also be
represented on our space-time diagram.

The Temporal Parts Theory of Identity (hereon TPT) is derived from the notion
of time being, in some sense or to some degree, like space. One can think of,
for instance, a linear timeline depicting the years all 46 U.S. Presidents
held office. Or one can think of the x-y axis used in physics. Time is
represented by the x-axis whilst space is represented by the y. Or one can
think of a space-time diagram containing two axes representing space and
another to represent time. These sorts of considerations have led some
philosophers and scientists to ask whether time is a dimension. According to
some accounts, time is the fourth dimension. Time, however, is not always
analogous to space. D.H. Mellor discussed these disanalogies at length. He,
for instance, concluded that there is no spatial analogue for our feeling of
the passing of time. We cannot, in other words, attribute the passing of time
to spatial changes (Mellor, D. H. _Real Time II_. London: Routledge, 1998.
95-96. Print.).

If the observer never quite sees the faller fall into the back hole while the
faller notices no difference in the passage of time and ultimately, crosses
the event horizon, time here can be taking on a different behavior along the
z-axis, in the dimension of depth along a curved plain. The 3:1 relation of
space-time can be simplified with a 3:3 relation which is virtually the same
as 1:1 or colloquially, one-to-one. To my mind, if simplicity is the aim, then
this is our next recourse. ST was borne out of an attempt to condense the
three dimensions of space into one dimension. That unfortunately did not work,
at least not as intended. We should therefore attempt to think of time in
three dimensions and see how this might help the project of unifying physics.

The fact of the matter is that we simply do not fully comprehend our own
universe and so, we can be gravely mistaken about time. If one considers ST,
and not necessarily whether the theory is true, but rather what the theory can
teach us, one quickly notices that ST’s dimensions have consequences for time
that are arguably more important than their ramifications for space. If ST is
the case or if something close to it is true, time is ultimately nonlinear and
therefore, not one-dimensional. So let us walk through what two-dimensional
time might look like. First, imagine that the ancestors of homo sapiens in the
far off future have invented time machines. If they can travel to and fro in
time, time is still one-dimensional. In two dimensions of space, one can move
horizontally and vertically. So then the question arises, what would it mean
for time to move vertically?

We tend to give the present an ontological status greater than that of the
past and the future. It appears that the only escape we have is the idea of
spatio-temporal oblivion. Queen Elizabeth I is not somewhere in the past under
the mistaken impression that _she_ and _not us_ is present. Time, therefore,
probably does not have one dimension. Forward implies backward and up implies
down, so any linear or circular view of time runs into problems of recurrence
and all sorts of time-related paradoxes like the well-known Grandfather
Paradox. Without straying too far in quantum mechanics, all of this is already
implied in Bell’s Theorem: “Most models of nature are reversible in time; we
can run the basic equations backwards in time as easily as forwards in time.
This implies that theories with causality forwards in time must also have
causality backwards in time; this was ignored by Bell” (t’Hooft, Gerard.

2\. The speed at which they appear to fall in will get asymptotically slow;
they will appear to fall in towards the event horizon at a slower and slower
speed, never quite reaching it.

For simplicity’s sake, I will consider GBT. Since presentists deny the spatio-
temporal parts of the past and thus, bury the past, we can imagine that for
presentists, time moves to the right on the x-axis (that is, along the first
quadrant of the axis) and also downward on the y-axis (along the fourth
quadrant). Growing block theorists, on the other hand, since they believe in
the future emerging at the present edge, see time moving in the same direction
as presentists on the x-axis, but moving along the y-axis in the opposite
direction, upward in the first quadrant. In other words, if the death of
temporal parts is a downward movement, the birth of temporal parts is an
upward movement.

Another eternalist conception that has been entertained can be called
recurrentism. Nietzsche probably explains it best:

Lately, I have been thinking a lot about time, both on a personal level and on
a philosophical one. Setting aside all of my thoughts on the kind of freedoms
and privileges I would need to truly own my time, the phenomenon of time
occupies my thoughts, in many ways from the mundane to the complex. When I was
younger and far less patient, I would grow incensed having convinced myself
that I picked the wrong bus out of the two that showed up at roughly the same
time because the other bus eventually drove past mine. As I got older and my
philosophical tendencies started to take root ever deeper, I started to notice
how whenever the other bus drove by the bus I was on, it would never get too
far ahead. In fact, it would arrive at my stop less than a minute before mine
did.

3\. The _amount_ of light coming from them gets less and less. In addition to
getting redder, they also will appear dimmer, even if they emit their own
source of light!

What if the critical error we continue to make is thinking of time as one-
dimensional? What if time has more than one dimension, just like space does? A
cursory look at Superstring Theory (ST) will begin to sound exactly like me in
a footrace with parallel me. Parallel or possible worlds emerge from the fifth
and sixth dimensions of ST. If it were possible to see the fifth dimension, we
would be able to take note of similarities and differences between the world
we occupy and a parallel world. Perhaps this is what our imagination does. If
a runner gets a cramp in her calf a few meters from the finish line, she may
envision herself winning the race in a world in where she did not get injured.
Perhaps we do, in fact, see the fifth dimension, but I digress.

On the cosmological interpretation of eternal return (see
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2016/05/15/interpretations-
of-nietzsches-doctrine-of-eternal-return/)), eternalism simply is the idea
that time is like a circle. There is a sense in which recurrentism is already
implied and though eternalists are usually not committed to the idea of time
literally repeating itself, if Socrates and Martian outposts exist, then time
and causation are a loop. This implies that some future event will jumpstart
the Big Bang and every event in the universe will play out in identical ways
all over again. This is precisely the sort of thinking entailed in the
presentist’s response to eternalism. Heather Dyke explains:

Nietzsche, therefore, has spatio and temporal parts, so if presentism were
correct, the interval of time represented by the ~54 years Nietzsche lived
would enter oblivion. The flow of time, as it pertains to Nietzsche’s life,
ends and yet, continues. Perhaps a better analogy (though in actuality, this
is time moving in three dimensions), presentists seem to imagine that time is
like a river, at least on the surface, but within it are whirlpools in where
intervals of time meet their end. With difficulty, therefore, one can imagine
time in more than one dimension even if one is not convinced of presentism.
Consider instead the growing blocking theory (GBT). On GBT, the present and
the past are real and the future becomes real when the present edge meets it.
Similarly, on the moving spotlight theory (MST), only objects within the
spotlight are considered present though objects on the peripheries still exist
(Emery, Ibid.). How might two-dimensional time look like under GBT or MST?

In the seventh dimension, one may find themselves in the mirror universe on
the other side of the Big Bang, in where the arrow of time travels backwards.
The eighth dimension would give one access to exotic universes, with initial
conditions so far from our own. In the ninth, one would possess the power to
compare and contrast every possible world from worlds very much like our own
to worlds decidedly unlike ours. Finally, the tenth dimension exhausts every
possibility.

Ultimately, our theories of time, along with physics, may be impeded by the
idea of one-dimensional time. Maybe it is time for us to begin thinking about
the behavior of time in two or three dimensions. ST already shows that there
are peculiarities about time across multiple dimensions, implying further that
the ten dimensions of ST are not dominated by space. In other words, it is not
that nine out of the ten dimensions belong to space and still one to time.
There could be a disproportion, like a space-time ratio of 6:4, but if ST
entails a few dimensions of time, we should begin conceptualizing how time
behaves in a multi-dimensional setting. This might help us to finally unravel
all of her mysteries and secrets. Until then, I leave you with a mind-bending
interpretation of what happens inside of black hole from Christopher Nolan’s
“Interstellar.”

In the sixth dimension, one would be able to see the universe as it was at the
beginning and an array of possibilities. One would, for instance, see
universes in where the rate of entropy is lower or higher than in ours. If
Boltzmann was correct, and time emerges from basic probabilities, then we
would see universes in where .000000001 nanoseconds do not equal a second, but
instead, .0.000000001515 nanoseconds equal a second, implying that time moves
slightly slower in that universe than it does here. This is to say nothing
about the arrow of time, which could move in the opposite direction (see
Cartwright, John. [“We may have a spotted a parallel universe going backwards
in time”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24532770-400-we-may-have-
spotted-a-parallel-universe-going-backwards-in-time/). _New Scientist_. 8 Apr
2020. Web. and De Chant, Tim. [“Big Bang May Have Created a Mirror Universe
Where Time Runs Backwards”](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/big-bang-
may-created-mirror-universe-time-runs-backwards/). _Nova_. 8 Dec 2014. Web.).

Especially for people high on the idea of the universe being conscious or that
there is a god(s), the universe would therefore offer us clues to help us
better understand time. Think of the notion of space and time changing places
within a black hole. Going back to the paradigm, namely the four-dimensional
concept of space-time, time would then have three dimensions and space would
have one. As Pösel explains:

Time is one of the most difficult phenomena to apprehend in the universe. It
is as elusive as it is seductive. It is safe to say that no one has won over
this lover’s heart. No one has seduced her enough to understand all of her
mysteries and secrets. It is because of this that I am often discouraged to
write anything about time, despite growing confidence in my philosophical
capacities. But just then, Musser said something that got the gears of my mind
running.

It can be argued, therefore, that if the history of philosophy of religion had
been different, then the history of philosophy of mind would have proceeded
differently. In other words, the missteps philosophers have taken throughout
the history of philosophy of mind likely would not have happened. Of course,
we would be dealing with a set of different mistakes, but some of these
mistakes would not prevail till this day due to the obstinacy of apologists
who do not want to relinquish the idea of Cartesian dualism. A thorough
understanding of ātman and anattā would have at least disabused us of the idea
of a theater of consciousness or a fixed self, and related ideas like qualia,
which as Dennett points out, are problematic. See my recent [“Nonphysicalism
in The Philosophy of Mind and Its
Shortcomings”](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/) for a discussion on why the
ideas of qualia and phenomenal consciousness are untenable.

As Coseru also points out, there is a sense in which the Buddhist idea of
anattā anticipated Hume who thought that there was no self to apprehend within
our perceptions. Along with anattā, Buddhists present “a fluid account of
experience as an ever-changing stream of psycho-physical events. This dynamic
model of human existence comprises the five classes of phenomena the Buddha
referred to as the “aggregates of grasping” ( _upādāna-skandha_ ), on account
of our tendency to grasp after and identify with them” (Ibid.). This is
opposed to our idea of a fixed self or consciousness experiencing life in a
Cartesian theater.

Further exploration of the self and ego delve too far into the philosophy of
mind, but brief comments are in order. The Churchlands and Dennett adhere to
anattā if ātman is defined as _phenomenal_ consciousness. Ramsey states:

On the philosophy of religion front, the concepts of ātman and anattā are
fertile ground for discussions within the cosmotheological and ontotheological
traditions (see Wildman, Wesley J. _Religious Philosophy as Multidisciplinary
Comparative Inquiry: Envisioning a Future For The Philosophy of Religion_.
State University of New York Press. Albany, NY. 2010. 248-261. Print. for an
overview of these traditions in the philosophy of religion). As stated
earlier, we now move away from mono or henotheistic frameworks and consider,
for example whether panentheism best explains features of the universe, on the
one hand, and features of being on the other. For one, consider the idea that
we are star stuff. We are comprised of the same matter and energy that
pervades the rest of the universe. In that sense, then, we are not distinct
and all things in the universe recede back to the Big Bang singularity.
Perhaps our ideas of essentialist distinction are illusory, a dream-like story
we continue to tell ourselves. In light of this, there is either no self or
the self reduces to the universe. Given the recent resurgence of panpsychism,
some have argued that the universe is very much like a supermassive brain (see
Ratner, Paul. [“The universe works like a huge human brain, discover
scientists”](https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/the-universe-works-like-
a-huge-human-brain-discover-scientists). _Big Think_. 19 Nov 2020). In any
case, a closer look at Hinduism and Buddhism will take us in non-monotheistic
directions that may prove fruitful in ongoing discussions in the philosophy of
religion and of mind.

Interestingly, the non-duality of Advaita Vedanta (monism), can be seen as
paraphrasing anattā in that ideas of the self are illusory, a part of the
Brahman dream ( _maya_ ). This leads to the idea of _mokṣa_ , the notion that
we can free ourselves from the cycle of death and rebirth. For Hindus adhering
to Advaita Vedānta, _mokṣa_ is attained when one accepts the self as being one
with Brahman. For Buddhists, Nirvana is the emptying of ideas of self and
ultimately realizing that there is no self; this is how one comes to free
oneself from the cycle of death and rebirth. Under both interpretations, there
is a sense in which there is no self. On the one hand, any self that is at
variance with the Brahman is illusory, a product of the maya while on the
other, there is simply no self and any erroneous ideas we get about the self
proceed from the ego. The ego is the engine through which false narratives of
the self are created.

Prajāpati also equates ātman with consciousness, but crucially, he also
conflates it with the material body. Prajāpati, therefore, presents a strain
of another school in Vedānta, namely Dvaita, which is dualistic. In a sense,
it is a dualism of mind and body or consciousness and the material, but more
importantly, it is a dualism of jīva and the Brahman, e.g., humankind and God.
Given Prajāpati’s distinction, we see the beginnings of monotheism or
henotheism, and the much later _bhakti_ tradition in Hinduism in where a
devotee of a given god is to unite their soul to this god by way of their love
and devotion. Though there are other interpretations of ātman and Brahman in
Hinduism, Advaita and Dvaita suffice for our purposes.

> In the beginning this world was only _brahman_ , and it knew only itself (
> _ātman_ ), thinking: ‘I am _brahman_.’ As a result, it became the Whole.
> Among the gods, likewise, whosoever realized this, only they became the
> Whole. It was the same also among the seers and among humans. Upon seeing
> this very point, the seer Vāmadeva proclaimed: ‘I was Manu, and I was the
> sun.’ This is true even now. If man knows ‘I am _brahman_ ‘ in this way, he
> becomes this whole world. Not even the gods are able to prevent it, for he
> becomes their very self ( _ātman_ ). So when a man venerates another deity,
> thinking, ‘He is one, and I am another’, he does not understand.

When considering the Hindu idea of ātman and the Buddhist response of anattā,
we can start to see how we could have avoided all of Descartes’ mistakes in
the philosophy of mind had we been more studied on Eastern religions or other
religions aside from Christianity. Christianity, akin to Dvaita, creates a
dualism between God and man. There is never a sense, per Christian theology,
in where man and God are identical or one. There is no sense in which man’s
consciousness and God’s are identical either. Descartes took this a step
further, dualizing the physical body and the mental soul. Hindus adhering to
Dvaita Vedānta had already committed this error and the Buddhist idea of
anattā, aside from reducing consciousness to the physical domain, suggested
that there is no-self to speak of and more importantly, that there is no
phenomenal consciousness to capture. It is an illusion.

The Vedic idea of ātman never fell out of fashion as is made apparent in
Uddālaka’s teachings. His idea of ātman is pretty much identical: it is the
life force within all living things, the very essence creating a bridge
between the parts and the whole. This is in keeping with Advaita Vedānta in
where the “experiencing self (jīva) and the transcendental self of the
Universe (ātman) are in reality identical (both are Brahman), though the
individual self seems different as space within a container seems different
from space as such” (Menon, Sangeetha. [“Vedanta,
Advaita”](https://iep.utm.edu/adv-veda/). _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. Web.). Yājñavalkya offers a different interpretation, equating
the self with consciousness rather than a life force. He ” characterizes the
self as that which has mastery over the otherwise distinct psycho-physical
capacities. He goes on to explain that we know the existence of the self
through actions of the self, through what the self does, not through our
senses—that the self, as consciousness, cannot be an object of consciousness”
(Black, Ibid.). Despite differences from Uddālaka’s interpretation,
Yājñavalkya still adheres to Advaita Vedānta. The Advaita school of Vedānta
yields a concept of God that accords with panentheism.

In Buddhism, there is no ātman. We are, therefore, introduced to the concept
of anattā or non-self. There is no static, immutable, essential soul or
consciousness. This is crucial for Buddhist teachings regarding suffering (
_dukkha_ ) and detachment because if one does not have the idea of an
essential self, one is less likely to pity himself over others, to regard his
own suffering as having higher priority than that of other beings. Coseru
elaborates:

Ultimately, we begin to see why it is of the utmost importance to break up the
Christian monopoly in philosophy of religion, so to speak. We can see how the
winding history of ātman and anattā anticipate certain strains in the
philosophy of mind while also providing new, fertile ground in the philosophy
of religion. In Advaita Vedānta, there is just one self, the Brahman. Every
other idea of self is illusory. This has some staggering implications for
ongoing discussions about identity as well. In Buddhism, given anattā, we see
that the “I Am that I Am” uttered by Yahweh is ultimately an error of the ego,
overinflated and now extended into the idea of God. Furthermore, this supports
the idea that the jealous, vindictive, tribalist gods so often prone to
favoritism, unironically, of the people who happen to worship them, are
created in our image. Anattā suggests that gods like Yahweh, Allah, and those
pertaining to the various mono and henotheisms around the world are extensions
of the ego imposing false ideas of the self. Most philosophers of religion,
concerned not only with the nature of but also with the identity of God,
seldom wrestle with the idea that perhaps there is no universal ātman, e.g.,
there is no God. This has some resonating implications all its own. The
purpose here has been to move the philosophy of religion in yet another
fruitful direction; while I can begin to exhaust possibilities, it is
important for me not to create a self-induced echo chamber, especially given
that my interest is to encourage philosophers of religion to travel down these
newly paved roads. Anattā has far reaching implications for free will, ethics,
identity, existentialism, and other areas of philosophy as well. In any case,
it should be clear why Christianity’s iron grip on the philosophy of religion
needs to be loosened.

We are on our own. If God existed, the extent of periods of isolation,
loneliness, depression, anxiety, in addition to having horrible symptoms (in
my case, losing most of my sense of smell, a fever, congestion, a loss of
taste), would not be necessary to help us relate to others, i.e., soul-making
theodicy. For human beings, the thoughts alone are horrifying enough. For a
parent, to die too soon, to not see their children become adults, to not dance
with their daughter at her Sweet 16, to not walk her down the aisle, to not
attend their son’s next baseball game, and so on, the mere thoughts are
terrifying enough. The thought of my absence in their life sends shivers down
my spine. I do not need to experience the reality of it; I do not need to
develop life-threatening symptoms and to settle on my life likely being over.
More importantly, my children do not need to experience a reality in where I
am dead. They do not need to see me in a suit, hands folded over my stomach,
lifeless in an open casket that cost the people who survived me x amount of
hundreds or thousands. They do not need to see me lowered into the ground.

Then it dawned on me. For many people, including _Christians_ , this was their
exact experience. They were isolated at home, probably hoping to be better
within a few to several days; the Christians, no doubt, prayed to God for
healing, to keep them company in their time of isolation and loneliness. For
many of them, the prayers fell on deaf ears. Their symptoms got much worse,
many developing life-threatening pneumonia. They were rushed to ICUs and
intubated where they would spend more time away from their loved ones. The
lucky ones, got back to their families. The Christians, thankful to God, were
happy to be back with their families. But what of the people who had not
embraced their loved ones for a month and never regained consciousness? What
of the people who passed away? Where was God? Where was his comfort when they
prayed? Where was his omnipotent power, fully capable of delivering them from
a virus some of them did everything in their power to prevent? Why didn’t God
answer?

Yet this was the reality many, including Christians, faced. Where was God?
Where is God? The idea that God would create a social species to “test” them
with periods of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and for some,
suicidal thoughts, is puzzling. Especially when considering the damage these
things do to people’s mental health, it is more perplexing still. Even if I
granted the idea of sin, unrepentant sin is recompensed in Hell; whether
eternal conscious torment or something else is for the theologians to argue
over. A punishment for sin would not risk impairing someone mentally. What
good is someone’s piety if they have lost their sanity?

I have two lovely children that I have not been able to hug for almost six
days now. I have not been able to kiss them. I have not been able to show any
affection to anyone I love. I have not been able to receive any affection
either. Because of this, I have been dealing with a lot of loneliness.

My father, who passed away in 2017, although no longer the voice of my
conscience, is someone I think of often. I miss him dearly. His lessons still
weigh on me and not a day goes by without me thinking whether he would be
proud of the man I am today. One of the lessons that I consistently observe is
to not get in the habit of letting myopia set in. In other words, yes, I
tested positive and I am dealing with symptoms, on top of anxiety, loneliness,
and grappling with questions about my mortality; however, other people have
had it much worse. It is these people this argument has in mind.

“There is only one thing a philosopher can be relied upon to do, and that is
to contradict other philosophers” – William James

This will likely be as close as it gets to a personal post from me. I recently
tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I do not know whether I am still
positive. I will be getting another test on Wednesday. My hope is that I can
go back to business as usual. I need to work; bills have to be paid. My focus
here is a new argument yes, but it goes beyond that as we will see. Rather
than the string of symptoms I have encountered, I want to focus on the mental
aspects of my experience.

I cannot imagine being my daughter, at an age where my affection can get
annoying but also at an age where they are able to appreciate my love. I
cannot imagine the fear they would feel seeing me stretchered out the door, to
hear news that I had to be intubated, to have to wrestle with the idea that
daddy won’t be coming home. They are at an age where losing a parent will be a
lucid memory, an enduring pain, a massive loss. This would shape my daughter
for the rest of their life. While I am grateful that they will likely not
endure this pain, I think of the children who have. Good parents are not
replaceable. I do not care if they are a Christian parent and while I am firm
in my belief that they teach their children erred beliefs, I know that there
are Christian parents who provide for their children, love them deeply, take
care of their emotions, protect them, nurture them, and help them grow. I
cannot imagine the pain of being orphaned in this way, especially when
believing that God has all the power, mercy, and love to ensure that such
suffering does not happen.

I am not interested in formalizing this argument. I think the force of it is
stronger rhetorically, written informally for readers to take in and think
over. I think COVID-19, as Rieux in Camus’ _The Plague_ conveyed about the
Black Death, brings theism to its knees. A god that permits pandemics to take
so many lives indiscriminately, leaving so many other lives in peril after
such loss, either does not exist or is not the god theists so desperately want
to exist. This is not about whether atheists/naturalists have an ontologically
objective standard of evil because this argument does not focus on the
existence of evil. This argument focuses on suffering, specifically mental
health. If your beliefs are so biased that your first reaction is to change
the topic or overlook the suffering of fellow human beings, including some of
your own brethren, you may have to wonder whether you are a sociopath. Only a
person with a severe lack of empathy will overlook what the last two years has
looked like for our species as a whole. God is not powerful enough to replace
a loving father or mother, to replace a son or a daughter.

Over the past few days, my symptoms have gotten progressively better. I am not
_a priori_ grateful. My gratitude is after the fact. I am grateful that I will
probably have more days with my loved ones. I am seeing the light at the end.
Soon I will be able to give my kids a warm embrace. I will be able to feel
them in my arms again. My life has, for now, been prolonged and I can be a
father to them. But the thought has occurred to me: what if my symptoms got
progressively worse? I have not been able to show or receive affection for six
days; six days could easily have been 15 to 30, or however long a hospital
stay would have lasted.

  *     * [ ![](https://s2.wp.com/i/logo/wpcom-gray-white.png) The Philosophy Corner ](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com)

Ultimately, I think this new angle on the Argument From Suffering is forceful
and makes a powerful case against theism, but if it has not been clear, that
has not really been my focus. My focus has been to humanize the experience of
so many people throughout the pandemic, to get us to think about the severe
pain some people are going through and have gone through over the past two
years. A theist might respond that everyone will be reunited in the afterlife
and while that may be comforting for some, that does nothing to change the
reality some people are facing. The holidays just passed and a chair usually
occupied by a loved one was empty. Somewhere in the world, a father enters his
daughter’s room wishing he could kiss her goodnight and tuck her in.
Elsewhere, a wife sleeps in a queen-sized bed hoping that the emptiness beside
her is just a bad dream. I might be one of the lucky ones. Time will tell. But
I am not taking this for granted and I am not taking it lightly. People have
suffered a lot over the last two years. I mourn for them and I wish I could do
more to bring them comfort.

I can easily imagine waking up last Thursday morning at 3am to the same cold
sweat and terror I felt. Moreover, I can imagine the object of my terror
turning out to be my experience. My mind was racing. I asked, what if I get
pneumonia? What if I have to be intubated? What if there is an underlying
issue that will pull the rug from under me? In all of this, I could not turn
to a loved one. I needed a hug but could not get one. I needed someone to sit
close to me and help me relax. Turning to a loved one at this time would put
them at risk, so I had no such option.

I’ll end with this. While your loved ones are here, hug them, let them know
you love them, try to put into words why you value them so much. Belief in the
afterlife is a lofty expectation that regrettably will not be met with a
loftier disappointment. “Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting
fantasy.”

The self-righteous will overlook this and find solace in the notion that
atheism/naturalism offer no hope. At least with theism we can imagine life
after death and seeing our loved ones again. In response to this, I maintain
that this leads to one taking one’s short days for granted. One might as well
procrastinate on affection, on spending quality time with loved ones if
eternity is guaranteed. On naturalism, it is incumbent on us to be more
mindful of how fleeting time is; one morning your daughter, just born, is
being fed her first bottle and it feels like a blink before she’s in middle
school. A defeater for this belief in an afterlife is that it allows some, if
not most, believers to forgo finding ways to be there for people who are
suffering; it is enough to give a person false hope and move on. A naturalist
knows that more can be done and love in the present goes a longer way than a
false promise in the future. If only I can sit in that empty chair next
Thanksgiving and hope to remind a person of their deceased loved one; if only
I can be there to wipe their tears away. People do not need the promise of
comfort tomorrow; they need help today, a lot of them being suffocated by
their pain at this very moment.

This is when one hears the old adage that sometimes God puts us through things
so that we can better relate to people who go through similar experiences. I
ask, how many people have to endure the same experience so that we can better
relate to others? It was enough for me to deal with six days of this, to feel
as though I was at the brink, to have more than enough time to contemplate my
own fragility and mortality. It was enough to realize that others have had it
worse and that for many, their story did not end the way they hoped; what’s
worse is that the stories of their loved ones continue without them. For the
many who survived the people we have lost, they have had to actually live
through the devastation I had the privilege of merely worrying about.

GC2 Therefore, “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best
explanation for the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena,
and the account of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a
form of occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436)

It is important to note that scientists are only concerned about causes
inasmuch as they have explanatory power. If a cause does no explanatory work,
then it does not help them to get a better understanding of a given
phenomenon. Think of Nancy Cartwright’s $1,000 bill descending in St.
Stephen’s Square. Scientists simply do not care to arrive at a model that
accurately predicts where the bill will land and more precisely, about its
exact movements through the air prior to landing. This particular example,
that involves any number of difficult to quantify variables, e.g., bird
droppings hitting the bill on the way down, dust particles slightly changing
the bill’s trajectory, wind speeds, does not help scientists better understand
drift, free fall, etc. Physicists already have general principles that help
them understand how, for instance, a basketball succumbs to the [magnus
effect](https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-the-physics-behind-this-crazy-
basketball-trick). A disposition of the ball, in particular its shape, makes
it susceptible to this effect whereas the dispositions of the bill guarantee
that it will drift wildly during the entirety of its descent to the ground.

A general note of relevance is in order. Gordon’s citations are mostly decades
old, which any peer reviewer in philosophy would immediately be suspicious of.
Of the Many Worlds Interpretation, Gordon states: “So which way of building
the universal wavefunction is to be preferred? This difficulty, known as the
“preferred basis problem,” reveals that the branching process itself is
completely arbitrary from a mathematical standpoint and therefore, from the
abstract point of view presupposed by the MWI, not reflective of any physical
reality” (427). Setting aside the non sequitur, “not reflective of any
physical reality,” his primary authority informing this statement, namely
David Wallace in 2003, no longer considers preferred basis to be an issue.
Gordon would know that if he had read Wallace’s 2010 paper “[Quantum Mechanics
on Spacetime I: Spacetime State
Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5294.pdf),” in where he states:

Any event appearing to be caused does not immediately invite scientific
scrutiny. _Only_ events that do explanatory work or are suspected of having
some explanatory power over a given effect, specifically in relation to a
theory or model, are worth examining. In any case, it does not follow from the
possibility that the PSR is false that our perceptual states have no
explanation or cause. Therefore, that we can have no confidence in our
perceptual states is completely non sequitur. Neuroscientists, cognitive
scientists, and psychologists have done plenty of work to show that our
perceptual states _do_ have explanations, regardless of whether the PSR is
true or not. Thus, if the PSR turns out to not be the case, our perceptual
states are not among events lacking a cause or an explanation.

Going over the litany of examples throughout history is not necessary because
Theism’s lack of explanatory success informs the behavior of today’s Theists.
Therefore, it suffices to point out that Theists have gone from asserting that
God is intimately involved in every aspect of reality, in addition to positing
that the Bible renders an infallible account of many historical events,
including a global flood, to relegating God to the outskirts of human
knowledge where the refulgence of science remains unfelt, as hidden somewhere
_before_ the Big Bang, active _solely_ in quantum phenomena that evade the
experiences of even the most devout believers, and as grounds for some
explanation of human consciousness that allows for the continuance of
consciousness after death, i.e., a philosophy of mind that entails the
existence of the soul, e.g., Cartesian dualism, Aristotelian hylomorphism,
panpsychism. Gordon’s argument is a prime example of this retreat to the far
reaches of scientific ignorance, hoping with all his might that he will find
God at the fringes of reality. If naturalism has pushed Theism this far, then
it is safe to say that Theism is teetering on the edge, that any argument
Theists put forth now are highly likely to fail, and that it is only a matter
of time before Theism plunges into the abyss.

In general, by simple induction, my skepticism of ALL Theistic arguments is
warranted. None have been convincing and more importantly, sound to lead me to
believe that any of the new arguments or new iterations of older arguments
will succeed where the older arguments failed. I think that if Theism had any
explanatory power, the evidence hitherto would have confirmed as much. That is
far from the case, hence recent retreats to deeply metaphysical territory; I
have no reason to believe a personal god that wants to be known and who loves
us is requiring us to chase him into the quanta and modal aspects of logic.
God would therefore, show no concern for people who simply have no interest in
quantum mechanics and metaphysics (both of which having a tendency to exclude
women and the poor, which includes a great deal of minorities who simply don’t
have exposure to STEM and philosophy or the opportunities and means to pursue
careers in these areas). So, it would seem, God only wants to save (mostly)
White, affluent men. Excuse my candor, but this is precisely why I am
begrudgingly an ally of philosophical atheism; a huge part of me wants to move
on into much more interesting aspects of philosophy knowing full well that the
god of these elitist academics, apart from being utterly incongruous with the
god of Christianity, doesn’t exist. I have no desire to entertain the idea of
a god that is discovered only by people who are mostly male, affluent, and who
have a high enough IQ to have a good grasp of the jargon involved in these
arguments — which excludes even a number of Theists who only cling to these
arguments because they purport to confirm their predilections. It has been
clear to me from a number of conversations that a lot of Theists cannot even
begin to understand arguments as complex as Gordon’s. Everyday people simply
do not have the means to understand general physics, relativity, quantum
mechanics, and predicate logic and pertinent areas in philosophy. This is
probably the most important thing I’ll say all week, so hopefully you’ve
understood what could be considered an argument from elitism against god’s
existence, or something like that.

G3 “Quantum theory raises fundamental questions about the coherence of
material identity, individuality, and causality that pose a prima facie
problem for naturalistic metaphysics” (Gordon, 423)

Ultimately, if a Theist wants to continue to assert that God has a hand in the
unification of quantum and classical phenomena, they need to take a different
route than Gordon has. Gordon severely undermines his own project by using
outdated sources, being completely unaware of the fact that one of the authors
of one of his primary sources changed their mind and actually proved the
opposite of what seemed to lend a hand to Gordon’s argument, and overlooking a
number of interpretations that may provide a stable and complete collapse of
the wave function, thus solving quantum paradoxes, like the measurement
problem and related observer effect. More damning to such arguments is that if
a personal, loving deity saw fit to retreat to the far reaches of metaphysical
reality, then he can have no desire to be known or detected by even people who
are hopelessly devoted and attached to him. Quanta lies so far outside of the
everyday experience of human beings that the idea that God is asking us to
pursue him into the microcosms of the quanta is, quite frankly, nonsensical.
It makes more sense that retreats like Gordon’s, into profoundly metaphysical
territory, has everything to do with Theism’s failure to square with science,
in addition to offering philosophical arguments or proofs that are sound or,
at the very least, cogent and without controversy. This is precisely the
prognosis for Theism and the relentless advances of science and philosophy,
closely in tow, do not look poised to provide any remedy. Gordon’s argument,
while complex, completely collapses in the face of simple considerations,
which is a happy irony given his claims about the quantum wave function.

Before setting out to formulate Gordon’s “Argument From The Incompleteness of
Nature,” a general note is in order. After years of dealing with the more
common arguments for God, e.g., the Kalam Cosmological, Moral, Fine-Tuning,
Teleological, Ontological arguments, I began to notice that such arguments
collapse when the complexity of the facts are analyzed. For instance, P1 of
the Moral Argument states that “If God does not exist, objective values and
duties do not exist.” This has proved to be the most controversial premise of
the argument, but analyses of what is meant by _objective_ , _values_ , and
_duties_ lead us in directions where we can apprehend morality along these
lines without God being necessarily involved. What I’m noticing now about more
complex Theistic arguments is that they collapse when the simplicity of the
facts are put on the table, i.e., when simple considerations are taken into
account. This also applies to Gordon’s argument. To see what I mean, it will
be necessary, first and foremost, to frame Gordon’s argument.

Right away, one can see how G1 through G3 hold insofar as scientific ignorance
remains the case. But first, it will be useful to take note of what motivates
Gordon to think that there is any truth to these premises. His primary
motivations are informed by what he thinks is the inability of physicists to
solve the measurement problem and that, at least from what he interprets is a
fault of naturalism, quantum interpretations violate the Principle of
Sufficient Reason (PSR) and/or are metaphysically implausible. If Gordon can
draw his conclusions by way of induction, by ruling out particular
interpretations yet to be offered on the basis of the shortcomings of six more
general interpretations, then a naturalist has more warrant to rule out Theism
by way of induction, by highlighting the many failures of Theism to square
with scientific facts and its many more failures to offer _sound_
philosophical arguments. God was once a _local_ deity, intimately involved in
matters far more mundane than quanta. It was widely believed that God created
the Earth, not via the gradual work of physical laws, but as intimately as a
potter forms his vase. Christians of the past even set out to prove God’s
involvement in the world. Donald Prothero gives us a prime example:

Before exposing glaring issues with Gordon’s conclusion, I will go over issues
with his analysis of the many worlds interpretation (MWI) and the Ghirardi-
Rimini-Weber spontaneous collapse interpretation (GRWI). Then I will provide
an overview of two interpretations that circumvent the measurement problem and
one of its entailments, the _[observer
effect](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-
theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/)_. Prior to that, there are already
issues with his analysis of the PSR that sound suspiciously like Plantinga’s
EAAN or worse, Lewis’ Argument Against Naturalism. Gordon states:

4) As for the whole “Two Dozen (Or So) Arguments” book, I think that some of
the arguments have been refuted. Given that I have read, at least, the gist of
some of the arguments, they are not convincing. The Argument From Too Many
Arguments is an egregious misuse of Bayes Theorem. Poston does not include
evidence against Theism in variable e, which requires all evidence for and
against a position. Deductive arguments, even where valid, are not evidence.
Sound arguments are evidence. In any case, Poston’s ~83% probability that
Theism is true is woefully overstated, especially given that arguments for all
other positions aside from Theism are not accounted for and that the 20+
arguments in the book are not shown to be sound.

_______. (2011a). “A Quantum-Theoretic Argument against Naturalism,” in Bruce
L. Gordon and William A. Dembski, eds., The Nature of Nature: Examining the
Role of Naturalism in Science. Wilmington: ISI Books, pp.179-214.

Gordon raises a second difficulty for the MWI: “The second difficulty lies in
its treatment of quantum probabilities” (Ibid.). Worse than using outdated
sources is Gordon’s misrepresentation of a source that actually _disagrees_
with his statement. Simon Saunders, in “Chance in the Everett interpretation,”
actually states: “To conclude: there is no good reason to think EQM is really
a theory of over-lapping worlds. If questions of overlap of branches are to be
settled by appeal to the underlying mathematics, in terms of vector space
structure, then there is at least one natural mereology in terms of which
worlds that differ in some feature, since orthogonal, are non-overlapping”
(Saunders, Simon (2010). Chance in the Everett interpretation. In Simon
Saunders, Jonathan Barrett, Adrian Kent & David Wallace (eds.), _Many Worlds?:
Everett, Quantum Theory & Reality_. Oxford University Press.). Saunders
attempts to “solve the problem without introducing additional structure into
the theory” (Vaidman, Ibid.) and yet Gordon tells his reader to “see Saunders
et al. 2010 for extensive polemics regarding it” (Ibid.). This is an egregious
level of malpractice that can only be explained by his desperation to prove
his belief in God.

G1 “Quantum mechanics reveals a genuine ontological indeterminacy and
incompleteness present in nature” (Gordon, Bruce L.. The Necessity of
Sufficiency: The Argument From The Incompleteness of Nature. _Two Dozen (or
so) Arguments for God: The Plantinga Project_ , Edited by Walls, Jerry L. &
Dougherty Trent. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018. 420. Print.)

2) I think that the two interpretations I summarized refute G2, especially the
LLI.

This is setting aside the fact that Gordon overlooked what many consider an
updated or even upgraded version of MWI, namely the Many Interacting Worlds
Interpretation (MIWI). The MIWI differs from the MWI in that all quantum
phenomena are the result of an inter-universal repulsive force acting on
worlds in close proximity to one another, thus explaining any dissimilarity
between them. Michael Hall, et. al. conclude that the MIWI can reproduce
quantum interference phenomena, in addition to offering advantages with
respect to computational modeling. They note that on the de Broglie–Bohm
Interpretation, the wave function denoted by Ψ, even when it is a very large
value allows computer modeling to focus on high density regions in
configuration space, specifically regions where calculation errors have to be
corrected to analyze convergence given norms of angular momentum (see Hall,

Great post, and i have 5 questions on this  
1) What do you think about G2 is the all physical cause-effect relations are
local? And if “yes” then is prove nature is incomplete?  
2) can any QM phenomena used to refute G2  
3)what do you think about gordon’s other articles?

1) G2 contains a non sequitur. I do not think non-local correlations have no
physical explanation. So no, I don’t think locality implies that nature is
incomplete.

1/2)some QM phenomena şike Quantum entaglement and smith’s simultaneous
causation thesis used to explain Jon-local correlations with local
correlations.  
5)there are 4 different arguments, first two are smith&grünbaum’s arguments
other two is leon’s arguments links:

There is also the Lindgren-Liukkonen Interpretation (LLI), championed by two
quantum physicists that take Ockham’s Razor seriously. Given this, their
quantum interpretation is a statistical interpretation that solves the
observer effect. In other words, there is no logical reason, to their minds,
why the results of a measurement are dependent on an observer. They dispense
with the notion of a conscious observer changing the result of measurements.
The LLI shows that any epistemological and ontological issues that stem from
the uncertainty principle are solved given that the uncertainty principle is a
fixed property of stochastic mechanics (see Lindgren, Jussi and Liukkonen,
Jukka. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as an Endogenous Equilibrium
Property of Stochastic Optimal Control Systems in Quantum Mechanics.
_Symmetry_ , 2020; 12 (9): 1533 DOI:
[10.3390/sym12091533](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12091533)

G2 “Since all _physical_ cause-and-effect relations are local, however, the
completeness of quantum theory implies the causal-ontological incompleteness
of physical reality: the universe is shot through with mathematically
predictable non-local correlations that, on pain of experimental
contradiction, have _no_ physical explanation” (Gordon, 421)

Singh considers Hilbert space as more fundamental than classical space, so
these GRW jumps occurring in Hilbert space give rise to the classical fabric
of space we are accustomed to. He posits that the wave function is contingent
on the configuration space where the particle moves through time, to
potentially infinite degrees of freedom. This then results in a complete
collapse of the wave function. Gordon’s hasty conclusion no longer holds if
Singh has succeeded in offering a version of GRWI containing a complete
collapse of the wave function.

Turning now to his analysis of GRWI, the prospects for his argument do not
improve. Gordon states of GRWI: “The problem is that it cannot be rendered
compatible with relativity theory or extended to the treatment of quantum
fields in this form” (Ibid.); “the theory remains radically non-local and has
the additional drawback of eliminating the possibility of particle
interactions and thus any physics of interest” (Ibid.); and “there are no
versions of the theory in which the collapse is complete, with the consequence
that all “material” objects have low- density copies at multiple locations,
the presence and effect of which linger forever in the GRWI wavefunction”
(Ibid.). The first and third concerns are not an issue for GRWI. The first
issue simply restates the more general difficulty physicists have had with
reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity; this would then be an
issue for the entire enterprise of quantum mechanics, so we would essentially
be tossing the bath water, baby and all! The third issue is an appeal to
ignorance. That there is currently no version of GRWI offering a collapse that
is complete does not mean that scientists ought to give up on the search for a
version containing a complete collapse. This leaves the second concern, which
is addressed in Tejinder Singh’s 2018 paper “Space and Time as a Consequence
of GRW Quantum Jumps,” where he deploys GRWI to solve the measurement problem.
Singh states:

_______. (2013a) “In Defense of Uniformitarianism,” Perspectives on Science
and the Christian Faith, vol. 65, no. 2, pp.79-86.  
4) What do you think about whole of “TWO DOZEN” book  
5) What do you think about Leon and Smith’s QM-based arguments for atheism

Gordon not only failed to rule out enough interpretations of quantum mechanics
to make his conclusion more likely, but he failed to rule out the best
defenses of, at least, two of the interpretations he is skeptical about. The
larger issue for Gordon is that even if he managed to rule out say, twenty
interpretations in quantum mechanics, his conclusion simply does not follow
and if it did, there are simple considerations that render it untenable.
Recall: “God’s existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for
the reality, persistence, and coherence of natural phenomena, and the account
of divine action best meeting this explanatory demand is a form of
occasionalist idealism” (Gordon, 436). It follows from this that God’s
existence and continuous activity is the best explanation for the reality,
persistence, and coherence of viruses, diseases, natural disasters, and pretty
much any undesired consequence a Theist can imagine. Clearly, Gordon does not
want to admit these natural phenomena into his conclusion, choosing instead to
special plead for any cases he thinks suit his argument. In other words, one
of his concerns fits better on his foot: Suppose, among all of the events that
happen in the universe, there are countless many that happen without God’s
continuous activity, e.g., pretty much all the bad stuff. If this were true,
we would have no principled way of telling which events were caused by his
activity and which were not, for events that _appeared_ to have been caused by
God, in fact, were not. It is far more probable therefore, that God has no
hand in any event in the natural world, not even granting a retreat into the
quantum realm.

GC1 Therefore, “a theistic variant of the Copenhagen interpretation brings
metaphysical completion to quantum theory so as to resolve the fundamental
puzzle” (Gordon, 423)

3) I cannot comment on Gordon’s other articles since I haven’t read them.

G4 (By way of inference) it is probable that all naturalistic interpretations
of quantum mechanics contain conceptual shortcomings (Gordon, 423-429)

But that would be a inaccurate restatement. A correct restatement in negative
terms would be:

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of Bayes’ Theorem with the
intention of bolstering this or that argument. This has resulted in an abject
misuse or abuse of Bayes’ Theorem as a tool. It has also resulted in an
incapacity to filter out bias in the context of some debates, e.g. theism and
naturalism. Participants in these debates, on all sides, betray a tendency to
inflate their prior probabilities in accordance with their unmerited epistemic
certainty in either a presupposition or key premise of one of their arguments.
The prophylactic, to my mind, is found in a retreat to the basics of logic and
reasoning.

If either of the terms in the conclusion is distributed, it must be
distributed in the premise in which it occurs

This is a perfect segue into probability. Again, since Bayes’ Theorem is
admittedly complex and not something that is easily handled even by skilled
analytic philosophers, a return to the basics is in order. I will assume that
the rule of distribution applies to basic arguments; this will turn out to be
fairer to all arguments because treating premises as distinct events greatly
reduces the chances of a given argument being true. I will demonstrate how
this filters out bias in our arguments and imposes on us the need to strictly
analyze arguments.  
  
 **Using Basic Probability to Assess Arguments**

Ultimately, my interest here has been a brief exploration into a fairer way to
assess competing arguments. All of this stems from a deep disappointment in
the abuse of Bayes’ Theorem; everyone is inflating their priors and no
progress will be made if that continues to be permitted. A more detailed
overview of Bayes’ Theorem is not necessary for such purposes and would likely
scare away even some readers versed in analytic philosophy and more advanced
logic. My interest, as always, is in communicating philosophy to the
uninitiated in a way that is approachable and intelligible. At any rate, a
return to the basics should be in order. Arguments should continue to be
assessed; validity and soundness must be met. Where soundness proves difficult
to come by, a fair initial probability must be applied to all arguments. Then,
all pertinent evidence must be accounted for and the consequences the evidence
presents for a given argument must be absorbed and accepted. Where amending of
the argument is possible, the argument should be restructured, to the best of
the arguer’s ability, in a way that demonstrates recognition of what the
evidence entails. This may sound like a lot to ask, but the pursuit of truth
is an arduous journey, not an easy endeavor by any stretch. Anyone who takes
the pursuit seriously would go to great lengths to increase the epistemic
certainty of his views. All else is folly.

As aforementioned, the first premise of the KCA is metaphysically laden. It
is, at best, indeterminable because it is an inductive premise; all it takes
is just _one_ entity within the universe to throw the entire argument into the
fire. To be fair, we can only assign a probability of .5 for this argument
being true. We can then use distribution to get the probability of the
argument being sound, so since we have a .5 probability of the first premise
being sound, and given that we accept that the argument is not in violation of
Kelley’s rules, we can therefore distribute this probability across one other
premise and arrive at the conclusion that the argument has a 50% chance of
being true.

Restating it this way appears controversial only because the argument seems to
presuppose that there is more than one universe. Two negatives must have
properties in common. Put another way, since there are many of all things,
then the universe cannot be the only thing of its kind, if we even agree that
the universe is like ordinary entities at all. Craig, perhaps unintentionally,
attempts to get a universal from a particular, as his argument restated under
the fourth rule shows. Given this, we come to the startling conclusion that
Craig’s KCA is invalid. Analyses of this kind are extremely rare in debates
because most participants do not know or have forgotten the rules of validity.
No amount of complexity hides a violation of basic principles. The advent of
analytic philosophy with Bertrand and Moore led to an increasing complexity in
arguments and for the most part, validity is respected. As shown here, this is
not always the case, so a cursory analysis should always be done at the start.

This argument, like the previous one, is valid and in accordance with Kelley’s
fifth rule. However, it is unsound. This harkens back to the notion that ducks
belonging to the domain of birds is not a piece of _a priori_ knowledge.
Despite knowing that all ducks are birds, the differences between birds and
mammals are not at all obvious. That is perhaps the underlying issue, a
question of how identity is arrived at, in particular the failure of the
essentialist program to capture what a thing is. The differentialist program
would have us identify a thing by pinning down what it is not. It follows that
we know ducks are birds because anatomically and genetically, ducks do not
have the signatures of mammals or any other phylum for that matter. A deeper
knowledge of taxonomy is required to firmly establish that ducks are, in fact,
birds.

With respect to the first rule, any argument that does not adhere to it
commits the fallacy of undistributed middle. Logically, if we take Modus
Ponens to be a substitute for a hypothetical syllogism, then undistributed
middle is akin to affirming the consequent. Consider the following invalid
form:

In a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one of
the premises

This is preferable to treating each premise as an isolated event; I am being
charitable to all arguers by assuming they have properly distributed their
middles. Despite this, a slightly different convention might have to be
adopted to assess the initial probability of an argument with multiple
premises. An argument with six individual premises has a 1.56% chance of being
true, i.e. .5^6. This convention would be adopted because we want a
probability between 0 and 100. If we use the same convention used for simpler
arguments with less premises, then an argument with six premises would have a
300% chance of being true. An arguer can then arbitrarily increase the amount
of premises in his argument to boost the probability of his argument being
true. Intuitively, an argument with multiple premises has a greater chance of
being false; the second convention, at least, shows this while the first
clearly does not. The jury is still out on whether the second convention is
fair enough to more complex arguments. There is still the option of following
standard practice and isolating an individual premise to see if it holds up to
scrutiny. Probabilities do not need to be used uniformly; they should be used
to make clear our collective epistemic uncertainty about something, i.e., to
filter out dogma.

The universe isn’t a *thing*. Your restatement clearly falls harder on the
horns of fallacy of composition than the original formulation of the Kalam
does. You’d first have to qualify that the universe has more in common with
ordinary things than it doesn’t; I don’t see how the sum of the parts is
equivalent to the parts, hence fallacy of composition

Now, a final question remains: how exactly does the probability of an argument
being sound increase? Probability increases in accordance with the evidence.
For the KCA to prove sound, a full exploration of evidence from cosmology is
needed. A proponent of the KCA cannot dismiss four-dimensional black holes,
white holes, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, and any theory not in
keeping with his predilections. That being the case, his argument becomes one
based on presupposition and is therefore, circular. A full account of the
evidence available in cosmology actually cuts sharply against the arteries of
the KCA and therefore, greatly reduces the probability of it being sound.
Conversely, it increases the probability of an argument like the Anti-Kalam
being true. The use of basic probability is so parsimonious that the
percentage decrease of the Kalam being sound mirrors the percentage increase
of the Anti-Kalam being sound. In other words, the percentage decrease of any
argument proving sound mirrors the percentage increase of its alternative(s)
proving true. So if a full account of cosmological evidence lowers the
probability of the Kalam being sound by 60%, the Anti-Kalam’s probability of
being true increases by 60%. In other words, the Kalam would now have a 20%
probability of being true while its opposite would now have an 80% of being
true.

If the conclusion is particular, one premise must be particular (Kelley, D..
The Art of Reasoning. _WW Norton & Co_. 2013. Print. 243-249)

“A deductive argument is _sound_ if and only if it is both valid, and all of
its premises are _actually true_. Otherwise, a deductive argument is _unsound_
” (Ibid.).

Validity, for instance, is more involved than some people realize. It is not
enough for an argument to _appear_ to have logical form. An analysis of
whether it, _in fact_ , has logical form is a task that is seldom undertaken.
When people think of validity, something like the following comes to mind: “A
deductive argument is said to be _valid_ if and only if it takes a form that
makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion
nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be
_invalid_ ” (NA. Validity and Soundness. _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. ND. Web.).

I don’t understand how you can say that the kalam violates the fourth rule.
You say that:  
(1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause for its existence.  
(2) The universe began to exist.  
∴ The universe has a cause for its existence.

Then, if a Bayesian theorist is not yet satisfied, he can keep all priors
neutral and plug in probabilities that were fairly assessed to compare a
target argument to its alternatives. Even more to the point regarding
fairness, rather than making a favored argument the target of analysis, the
Bayesian theorist can make an opponent’s argument the target of analysis. It
would follow that their opponent’s favored argument has a low probability of
being true, given a more basic analysis that filters out bias and a systematic
heuristic like the one I have offered. It is free of human emotion or more
accurately, devotion to any given dogma. It also further qualifies the
significance of taking evidence seriously. This also lends much credence to
the conclusion that arguments themselves are _not_ evidence. If that were the
case, logically valid and unsound arguments would be admissible as evidence.
How would we be able to determine whether one argument or another is true if
the arguments themselves serve as evidence? We would essentially regard
arguments as self-evident or tautologous. They would be presuppositionalist in
nature and viciously circular. All beliefs would be equal. This, thankfully,
is not the case.

could be restated as:  
(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that is uncaused.  
∴ All universes have a cause.

Validity is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to prove effective
and persuasive. This is why arguments themselves cannot substitute for or
amount to evidence. Soundness is determined by taking a full account of the
evidence with respect to the argument. The soundness of an argument is
established given that the pertinent evidence supports it; otherwise, the
argument is unsound. Let us turn to some simple examples to start.

This argument is stated under Kelley’s fifth rule and is no doubt valid. Now,
whether or not the argument is sound will have us looking for _external_
verification. We might say that, _a priori_ , we know that there are no ducks
that are not birds. By definition, a duck is a kind of bird. All well and
good. There is still the question of whether there is a duck named Larry. This
is also setting aside the legitimacy of _a priori_ knowledge because, to my
mind, normal cognitive function is necessary to apprehend human languages and
to comprehend the litany of predicates that follow from these languages. We
know that ducks are birds _a posteriori_ , but on this point I digress.
Consider, instead, the following argument.

Despite my naturalistic/atheistic leanings, the probability of my argument is
also .5 because Craig and I share premise 1. The distribution of that
probability into the next premise does not change because my second premise is
a negation of his second premise. In one simple demonstration, it should
become obvious why using basic probabilities is preferable over the use of
Bayes’ Theorem. No matter one’s motivations or biases, one cannot grossly
overstate priors or assign a probability much higher than .5 for
metaphysically laden premises that are not easily established. We cannot even
begin to apply the notion of _a priori_ knowledge to the first premise of the
KCA. We can take Larry being a bird as obvious, but we cannot take as obvious
that the universe, like all things within it, began to exist and therefore,
has a cause.

When affirming the consequent, one is saying Q ⊃ P. It is not surprising that
these two fallacies are so closely related because both are illegitimate
transformations of valid argument forms. We want to say that since all P are Q
and all R are P, therefore all R are Q in much the same way we want to infer
that P ⊃ Q. Consider the well-known Kalam Cosmological Argument. No one on
both sides questions the validity of the argument because validity, for many
of us, is met when the conclusion follows from the premises. However, one can
ask whether the argument adheres to Kelley’s rules. If one were to analyze the
argument closely enough, it is very arguable that the argument violates
Kelley’s fourth rule. The issue is that it takes transposing from the fifth
rule to fourth rule because the argument does not violate the fifth and
therefore, appears valid. However, when restated under the fourth rule, the
problem becomes obvious. In other words, the universe is a particular in both
Craig’s conclusion and in the second premise of his argument. Let’s consider
the KCA restated under the fourth rule:

I did use “thing” in my restatement, but that’s the issue with adopting the
error of the original phrasing. I am paraphrasing Craig and showing how it’s
in violation of the fourth rule. If going by your restatement, the conclusion
is still not negative and therefore, violates the fourth rule.

If either premise of a valid syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be
negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative

(1)There are no things that are uncaused.  
(2)There is no universe that did not begin to exist  
∴ There are no universe that begin to exist uncaused

An exploration of soundness is much more challenging when analyzing
metaphysically laden premises. Consider, for example, the second premise of
the KCA: “The universe began to exist.” What exactly does it mean for anything
to begin to exist? This question has posed more problems than solutions in the
literature; for our purposes, it is not necessary to summarize that here. We
can say of a Vizio 50-inch plasma screen television that it began to exist in
some warehouse; in other words, there is a given point in time where a
functioning television was manufactured and sold to someone. The start of a
living organism’s life is also relatively easy to identify. However, mapping
these intuitions onto the universe gets us nowhere because as I alluded to
earlier, the universe is _unlike_ ordinary entities. This is why the KCA has
not been able to escape the charge of fallacy of composition. All ordinary
entities we know of, from chairs to cars to elephants to human beings exist
_within_ the universe. They are, as it were, the parts that comprise the
universe. It does not follow that because it is probable that all ordinary
things begin to exist that the universe _must_ have begun to exist.

But that was not the question. The question was whether it violated the fourth
rule. Besides, you used the same word “thing” in *your* own restatement, and
you missed that I sent a replacement reply correcting the first premise to
“(1) Nothing that begins to exists is uncaused” (since that would be more
accurate to Craigs formulation) before you published my first!

Ultimately, I think EFT should supplant panpsychism in popular circles. I can
agree with the notion of conscious cells because they are among the smallest
structures atoms have assembled into within living things. I disagree with the
idea of conscious particles because when they organize into air fryers,
thermostats, buildings, mountains, and sand dunes, despite having comparable
mass, size, shape, and charge to living things, none of these objects appear
to be conscious; in other words, none of these objects appear to be aware,
awake, attentive, and most importantly, _alive_. I can knock on a fish tank
and the fish with the blankest stare in the tank can respond to a stress
signal and move away from that area in the tank. I can throw a rock repeatedly
into a harder material and it will continue to remain idle; put another way, I
can take a geologist’s hammer to sediment over and over again, whether for a
dig or in a fit of sustained rage, and the sediment will remain idle, allowing
me to crack and break it as much as I please. Conscious beings, on the other
hand, have a bias toward survival and retention of their structure. To use as
humane an example as possible, if you were to do something that caused an
insect pain, perhaps sending minor electrical charges into one of its legs,
its automatic response will be to try to escape the situation. The insect,
like you, wants to survive and ensure that it is not crushed or, in this case,
burnt to a crisp. The same cannot be said of the myriad, non-experiential
macro objects around us day in and day out. Strawson and panpsychists, aside
from co-opting terms like physicalism when they really do not mean
physicalism, would do well to renounce panpsychism and accept a better theory
of ultimates: electric fields theory of consciousness. Then they can come to
my pluralist physicalist account that allows for compound reductionism. To my
mind, this is the only real way to study consciousness.

If experiential particles give rise to sight, then why do particles seem
entirely dependent on eyes? Why do they not simply configure themselves in
another way in order to circumvent the blindness of the eyes? It is quite
telling that in the absence of a sense, the corresponding phenomenal aspect of
experiences associated with that sense are also absent. My _compound
reductive_ account predicts this; this is unsurprising on my theory of
consciousness whereas on Strawson’s account, and any panpsychists account,
there is no way to account for this. Severe retinopathy is usually what causes
people to be born blind. There are millions of light-sensitive cells within
the retina, along with other nerve cells that receive and process the
information that is sent to your brain, by way of the optic nerve. On EFT,
therefore, blindness is damage within the electric fields that result in
sight. The cure for blindness is to restore the electric fields within these
cells so that communication between nerve cells is possible. That would then
restore any corresponding phenomenal experiences. The mere organization of
particles clearly does not accomplish this. EFT seems to have far more
explanatory power than panpsychism does and if we took pains to assess just
our five ordinary senses, we would be able to see that like blindness,
anosmia, aguesia, deafness, and things like neuropathy, hypoesthesia, and CIP
(congenital insensitivity to pain) are all reducible to nerve cell damage in
the nose, mouth, ears, and extremities respectively. In simple terms,
bioelectric pathways are damaged and thus, turn off communication to the
brain, and in turn, cut off the corresponding qualia. This is essentially what
I mean by recontextualizing qualia and Strawson clearly does not dodge that
bullet.

I will free to skip the entire section on emergentism because while I find
this account intriguing, it is implausible and has, what I think, are obvious
commitments. Strawson defines it as follows:

Why a blog post and not a proper response in a philosophy journal? My very
first journal submission is still in the review process, close to two months
later, for one. Secondly, blogging allows me to be pedantic, to be human, that
is, to express frustration, to show anger, to be candid; in other words,
blogging allows me to be myself. Probably of highest priority is the fact that
I do not want my first publication in the philosophy of mind to be a response.
I want to eventually outline my own theory of consciousness, which is strongly
hinted at here, and I prefer for that to be my first contribution to the
philosophy of mind. I do not find panpsychism convincing and I think there is
another theory of consciousness, similar to panpsychism in ways, that is much
more cogent. I have outlined some qualms I have with panpsychism before; to
people new to the blog, you can read
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/). In any case, I will be
responding to a number of points in Strawson’s _[Realistic Monism: Why

Panpsychism](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/anand.vaidya/courses/c2/s0/Realistic-
Monism---Why-Physicalism-Entails-Panpsychism-Galen-Strawson.pdf)_. Here I will
outline refutations that should leave panpsychism unresponsive once and for
all as it is not a productive theory of consciousness, i.e., it does no
explanatory work and does not illuminate further research; it gives us no real
direction to go in.

    * Already have a WordPress.com account? [Log in now.](https://wordpress.com/log-in?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fnaturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com%2F2021%2F03%2F20%2Fa-reply-to-strawson-physicalism-does-not-entail-panpsychism%2F&signup_flow=account)

He explains: “It follows that real physicalism can have nothing to do with
_physicSalism_ , the view — the faith — that the nature or essence of all
concrete reality can in principle be fully captured in the terms of _physics_.
Real physicalism cannot have anything to do with physicSalism unless it is
supposed — obviously falsely — that the terms of physics can fully capture the
nature or essence of experience” (4). I think the word _physicSalism_ is
clunky and so, I will exchange it for the word _physicsism_ , which I think
ties nicely to its predecessor _scientism_. There is not a chasm between
someone who thinks science is the only way of knowing and someone who thinks
physics is capable of explaining everything. Strawson makes the mistake of
thinking physics stands alone among the hard sciences, as if it is _the_
ground level of scientific explanation. I think chemistry joins physics in
that department and as such, real physicalists can be physicsists if they are
also chemistrists, the idea that a great number of physical phenomena are
reducible to chemistry. If monism, that there is only one substance, and
physicalism, that this one substance is physical in nature, are true then it
is incumbent on Strawson to address the notion that science cannot apprehend
certain physical phenomena. Strawson, therefore, is guilty of the same
dualistic tendencies he accuses Dennett of (5), and he seems to bite the
bullet on this in offering his “‘experiential-and-non- experiential ?-ism’”
(7). Per his view, there are actual physical phenomena explainable by science,
especially ground level hard sciences like physics and chemistry. On the other
hand, there are quasi-physical phenomena in where Strawson feigns at
physicalism while also betraying the fact that he means nothing more than
nonphysicalism. This has to be qualified.

So, let us grant that Strawson would qualify the sense of sight as
uncontroversially physical. Now, he claims that the what-it’s-likeness of
seeing red is also physical and yet, science has no account for this per his
claims; not only does science have no current account, but it can never have a
viable account because, in his own words, “experiential phenomena ‘just are’
physical, so that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and
neurophysiology record (or can record)” (7). I am a real physicalist and I
strongly disagree with this statement. For starters, I think his statement is
informed by a conflation some people tend to make: if something is explainable
by science, it lacks existential meaning and so, anything that is explained by
science enables nihilism. In other words, if we can explain the origin of
morality without recourse to God, morality is suddenly meaningless in the so-
called ultimate sense and just is relativistic or subjectivistic. This is
wrong-headed. Explaining the what-it’s-likeness of red would not change the
fact that red is my favorite color; nor would it change my experience of
seeing a blood red trench coat hanging in a clothing store, as if begging me
to purchase it. In a naturalistic world, meaning is decided by us anyway and
so, nihilism does not follow from the fact that science explains something.
Love is not any less riveting, captivating, and enrapturing if science somehow
explained every detail about falling in love, loving one’s children, loving
the species one belongs to, and loving species entirely different from
oneself.

Likewise, I know that sexual attraction reduces to mostly superficial,
properly aesthetic, considerations and pheromones that induce a reaction in my
brain, which then translate to a host of bodily reactions, e.g., feeling flush
and then blushing, feeling either nervous, excited, or some combination of
both, feeling a knot in my stomach. This does not accomplish making my
attraction meaningless or, at least, making it less meaningful because, in
truth, while I understand the science of attraction, it does not register when
I am in the middle of experiencing attraction. These considerations factor
even less when I have fallen in love. I do not think, “well damn, scientists
have me pegged and I am only feeling all of these sensations because of
serotonin and dopamine releases in my brain; love is ultimately meaningless.”
What gives vibrance to experience is the experiencer.

The non-experiential thesis: “[NE] physical stuff is, in itself, in its
fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential” (11)

This is probably the most damning response to Strawson: various domains of
science are needed to understand consciousness. If EFT is accurate, and I see
no reason for it to be inaccurate, cell biology is just as crucial as physics,
chemistry, and neurophysiology. This makes for a comprehensive understanding
of consciousness, comprised of the convergence of all our domains of
knowledge. Philosophy of mind no doubt has a role to play, but not when it
ventures far and wide from what science suggests. There is already a
fundamental distinction between non-life and life, between inanimate objects
and people. It follows, therefore, that if consciousness is inhered in living
things, then it cannot be attributed to non-living things. This smacks of
common sense and yet, philosophers are willing to occupy the fringes with
popular theories like panpsychism. Some pretty anecdotes have come from this
idea. Some say we are the universe experiencing itself, but if the universe
already had all the makings of phenomenal consciousness, why does it need
overrated chimpanzees who are preoccupied with reality tv, social media,
violence against one another, and all manner of mundane and superficial
nonsense to understand itself? If any composition at all, even absent
bioelectric fields, is enough to account for consciousness, why not just
configure itself into a Boltzmann brain that has no potential to develop the
silly prejudices and biases humans tend to have?

While I am committed to monism, the idea that only physical substance exists,
and am therefore committed to physicalism, I am not committed to the idea that
particles are the kinds of ultimates that attend to consciousness. Cells are
the ultimates that attend to conscious beings like ourselves. This is the
reason why the boulder lacks consciousness despite weighing as much as I do.
Intuitively, the boulder should have roughly the same amount of particles in
its structure as I do, but of utmost priority here is determining what I
possess that the boulder does not. I am, as it were, activated by electric
fields, receptive to my environment, can respond and adapt to it. The boulder,
on the other hand, cannot do this. One might want to ask why, when the boulder
finds itself gradually eroding under a small waterfall, it does not simply
relocate itself? If, like me, it has a rudimentary spark of consciousness, why
does it resign itself to a slow death, i.e., erosion? Bioelectric fields
account for why I will move out of the way of an oncoming vehicle while the
boulder remains idle under the waterfall, slowing eroding as time goes on.

This aversion to science eventually explaining qualia reeks of nonphysicalism
and to my mind, just _is_ nonphyiscalism being labeled as _physicalism_ ,
which is really just a nominal label that is so far failing to cohere with
what is normally meant by physicalism. The notion that physics, chemistry,
genetics, and neurophysiology can never record those aspects of neurons that
account for qualia is incompatible with physicalism. If science can apprehend
physical substance, and qualia _are_ a physical substance as Strawson claims,
then science can apprehend qualia. To say otherwise is for Strawson to admit
that what he means by _physical_ in the case of qualia is actually not
physical at all. It is covert dualism and nonphysicalism. I have no qualms
with scientists fully understanding why red is my favorite color. This does
not then dampen my experience or make it meaningless.

Strawson and other panpsychists are looking in one of the right places, to be
sure, but understanding phenomenal consciousness is like understanding a crime
scene, and as such, we have to be aware of various factors that make the crime
cohere, from blood spatter patterns to the murder weapon to point of entry
(and whether or not it was forced entry) all the way up to possible motive. If
we stop short at the murder weapon, then we can conclude the person was
stabbed, but we cannot make any conclusions as to how many times, in what
areas of the body, by whom, and for what reason. Phenomenal consciousness,
uncontroversially, is exactly like that! Strawson and panpsychists sit out on
the porch of the brain and do not venture into a mansion with many rooms,
light switches, outlets, and the such. Neurons, synapses, neurogenesis,
neurodegeneration, memory formation, recollection, confabulation, and so on
are critically important in accounting for certain experiences. We cannot say
the what-it’s-likeness of déjà vu is due to the fact that particles are
conscious. That tells us nothing, does not help us elucidate on this
experience, and ultimately, lacks explanatory power. It is simply a vacuous
claim. Real physicalists can enter the many-roomed mansion and start to
explain why this experience _feels_ a certain way, and why some of us
interpret it the way we do; for instance, there is a delay between seeing and
being aware that we have seen, and so, in those small intervals of time, we
can fool ourselves into thinking we have already seen what we just realized we
saw. In other words, your brain “knows” what you see before you realize you
have seen it. Generally, however, scientists think that déjà vu is tied to
memory, so if we are sitting on the porch, trying to explain what it’s like to
have this experience, we are in the wrong part of the house. We have to
venture into the hippocampus, for instance (see Hamzelou, Jessica. [“Mystery
of déjà vu explained – it’s how we check our
memories”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101089-mystery-of-deja-vu-
explained-its-how-we-check-our-memories/). _New Scientist_. 16 Aug 2016.
Web.).

My account starts to make clear how I can be committed to NE and RP and lead
us in the right direction as it concerns Z phenomena. P phenomena are well-
accounted for as they pertain to inorganic compounds. Of course, it begs the
question to say that we have not quite nailed P phenomena as they concern
organic chemistry. To reiterate, our ignorance with respect to how inorganic
compounds become organic compounds that are essential to life does not give us
license to make as many wild assumptions as we please. Any hypothesis, even
within philosophy, especially if it encroaches on the territory of science,
has to demonstrate awareness of scientific literature or at least, incorporate
science wherever it is germane to one’s theory. Claiming that particles are
actually experiential entities that account for why we are conscious pushes
the buck back. Panpsychists have moved the goalposts and if they were correct,
we would still be tasked with comprehending the consciousness of things
utterly unlike ourselves. Thankfully, we do not have to do that and we can
focus our energy on understanding why there is a what-it’s-likeness to our
experiences. Again, there are important clues: for instance, people who were

If this is the case, then emergentism is committed to idealism and to
solipsism, “sometimes expressed as the view that “I am the only mind which
exists,” or “My mental states are the only mental states”” (Thornton, Stephen.
[“Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds”](https://iep.utm.edu/solipsis/).
_Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_. Web.). The obvious drawback here is
that there is no way to pin down where these properties emerge from. The
source will vary from one first person point of view to the next or, to put it
facetiously, from one person under the illusion that they have first person
perspective to another person under the same illusion. I will claim that all
that exists is my mind while someone else can lay claim to their own mind
existing. I will then claim that all else emerges from my mental states while
the next person makes the same claim. Then the question becomes, when we are
both shopping for clothes, why do we both see a blood red trench coat for sale
and why is it that my mental state of wanting to buy it does not emerge from
his mental state of barely noticing the coat? How can these same properties
group together to become the same object from two people under the illusion
that their respective mental states are the only mental states? Emergentism,
with respect to consciousness, does not evade these problematic commitments.

To do away with Strawson’s assertions concerning consciousness coming from
experiential ultimates, I summon help from an unexpected source. Though the
neo-Aristotelian uses this thought experiment for different purposes, it is
enough to show that basic organization does not consciousness make. Jaworski,
no doubt inadvertently, presents a version of the combination problem that
cuts deeply into Strawson’s thesis. He explains:

> Experiential phenomena are _emergent_ phenomena. Consciousness properties,
> experience properties, are emergent properties of wholly and utterly non-
> conscious, non-experiential phenomena. Physical stuff _in itself_ , in its
> basic nature, is indeed a wholly non-conscious, non-experiential phenomenon.
> Nevertheless when parts of it combine in certain ways, experiential
> phenomena ‘emerge’. Ultimates in themselves are wholly non-conscious, non-
> experiential phenomena. Nevertheless, when they combine in certain ways,
> experiential phenomena ‘emerge’. (12)

“The central idea of neutral monism is that there is a fundamental, correct
way of conceiving things — let us say that it involves conceiving of them in
terms of ‘Z’ properties — given which all concrete phenomena, experiential and
non-experiential, are on a par in all being equally Z phenomena” (23)

Correlation doesn’t *always* imply causation. Correlation may be suggestive of
causation, however. In the post, I outline very clearly how nerve cells, which
carry electrical signals from a sense area to the brain, fail to carry out
these tasks when they are significantly damaged. I talked out retinopathy.
Likewise, damage to the auditory nerve, which carries signals from the ear to
the brain, results in deafness. Injury to the olfactory nerve can cause
anosmia. I can go on, but it’s quite clear that the electrical pathways have
been cut off in these cases. Crucially, panpsychism has no account for this at
all. That is the point. EFT at least provides heuristics and points us in a
fruitful direction. Panpsychism has no explanatory power by comparison. In any
case, my compound reductionism does not necessarily require EFT; my theory can
subsume or do away with any other physicalist explanation. What’s important
for my theory is whether different domains of consciousness physically
reducible. I think that’s already conclusive despite phenomenal consciousness
being the lone gap in our knowledge

Strawson stipulates that “real physicalists … cannot deny that when you put
physical stuff together in the way in which it is put together in brains like
ours, it constitutes — is — experience like ours; all by itself. All by
itself: there is on their own physicalist view nothing else, nothing non-
physical, involved” (12). This is patently false as it alludes to mind-brain
identity theory. It is not just atoms coming together in brains like ours.
Human consciousness is _compound reductive_. In other words, human
consciousness is not reducible to _just one_ physical, macro aspect about our
biological structure. That is to say that it is not reducible to just our
hands or just our feet or just our brains. Strawson’s conflation of
physicalism, as usually construed, and mind-brain identity theory leaves out
crucial elements of experience, namely our central and peripheral nervous
systems; the _parts_ of the brain because anyone versed in the pertinent
science knows that when it comes to the brain, the parts are more integral to
consciousness than the whole; sense apparatus like our eyes, noses, pain
receptors, and so on; and finally, external objects that provide the mind with
data to process, interpret, make sense of, and so on.

To understand the next couple of sections in his paper, in where Strawson’s
claims go off the rails and get even wilder, the following have to be kept in
mind:

Setting aside Strawson’s side-stepping of chemistry, which easily shows how
liquid water can “emerge” from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, the
reason we cannot have Z phenomena is because the question of how consciousness
can come from non-consciousness is itself reducible to a scientific question
that has yet to be fully answered: how did life arise from non-life?
Consciousness, as we know, is found in _living_ things, so per the combination
problem, what criteria need to be met for a consciousness like ours to take
shape? Is it size, mass, shape, charge? Buildings and mountains are far more
massive than us and by extension, are larger and have more particles
generating what should amount to greater charges; and yet, mountains and
buildings do not appear to be conscious at all. This is a critical clue
because clearly, the haphazard combination of particles when a mountain forms
or when a building is erected does not accomplish giving rise to consciousness
like ours. Briefly, the combination problem can be formulated as follows:

Strawson states: “You’re certainly not a realistic physicalist, you’re not a
real physicalist, if you deny the existence of the phenomenon whose existence
is more certain than the existence of anything else: experience,
‘consciousness’, conscious experience, ‘phenomenology’, experiential ‘what-
it’s-likeness’, feeling, sensation, explicit conscious thought as we have it
and know it at almost every waking moment” (3). Strawson not only sounds like
an absolutist, but he has, no doubt intentionally, boxed out _real_
physicalists like the Churchlands and Daniel Dennett. For my purposes, I deny
none of these things. I am not an eliminativist though in the past I have
called myself such when I lacked a better term for my own point of view. Now,
I believe I have located a better term and so, I call myself a
recontextualist. I do not deny qualia. What I strongly deny is what
panpsychists think they entail: usually a version of nonphysicalist
panpsychism or even covert substance dualism in where mental phenomena are
ethereal. In light of this, I suggest that qualia are _physically_ reducible
in obvious ways already known to us _and_ in currently non-obvious ways yet to
be discovered or understood; we simply have to do the work of demonstrating
how what-it’s-likeness is physically reducible. I do not think Strawson dodges
recontextualism and this will become clearer as we move on.

From the perspective of differential ontology, and given that I have been
thoroughly disabused of flippant idealism and solipsism, I know that my
thoughts are not organically generated as if in a vacuum, within my brain. My
thoughts are invariably and intimately connected to whatever I am occupied
with, in the present time by Strawson’s various claims about what physicalism
entails. If he had never written his thoughts, then I would not be countering
his claims with my own. Perhaps I would be thinking about lunch at 12:26 pm
ET, but alas, I am not. The point being that when I do start to think about
having lunch, my thoughts about what to eat will be influenced by hunger pangs
that amount to a feedback loop between my brain and my gut, again
demonstrating the importance of organs other than just the brain in accounting
for my experience, and pretty much any human being’s experience, of hunger.
That feeling would take priority over my desire to respond to Strawson.
Deciding what to eat amounts to constraints, like what food I have in my
pantry and refrigerator and a desire not to spend money on takeout. So, I can
only end up eating what is already available to me; in this case, only
unexpected factors can change this course. Perhaps a neighbor or a relative is
decided on bringing me baked lasagna and since I currently do not know that
they have these plans, that option does not feature in what I am thinking of
having for lunch. In any case, what has become clear is that phenomenal
consciousness reduces, in part, to a litany of physical objects, some of which
are not even in your vicinity. What is also clear is that the brain alone does
not account for phenomenal consciousness.

Real Physicalism: “[RP] experience is a real concrete phenomenon and every
real concrete phenomenon is physical” (12)

Intuitively, I do not say that what changed is _just_ the organization or
structure of these materials. That dodges Jaworski’s neo-Aristotelian
commitments. I also add that the _spark_ of consciousness is what changed.
There is, in this case, irreparable damage to the claustrum, thus making
consciousness impossible to turn back on, so to speak (see Koch, Christoph.
[“Neuronal “Superhub” Might Generate
Consciousness”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/neuronal-superhub-
might-generate-consciousness/). _Scientific American_. 1 Nov 2014. Web.).
Furthermore, there is irreparable damage to other pivotal organs that make it
possible for us to __ make any claim to being _alive_. The liver, heart,
stomach, etc. have all lost their function. The matter is still there, but the
electric fields that make us conscious are permanently off. This is why I am
conscious and an inanimate object, equal in size and weight to me, perhaps a
boulder, is not conscious. Non-experiential things can be used to design other
non-experiential things or can naturally form into other non-experiential
things given that organic compounds and electric fields are entirely absent.
The question of how consciousness arises from non-consciousness just is the
question of how life arises from non-life. Just because we currently do not
have a fuller, more detailed picture does not mean we have license to offer
theories like panpsychism, which possess nothing in the way of explanatory
power. The panpsychist and neo-Aristotelian think they are headed in some
definite direction, but they are both quickly approaching dead ends.

Experience is akin to aesthetics, hence why we find some experiences
pleasurable while there are others we can describe with an array of negative
words and connotations. Science can also explain why a lot of people hate
waiting for a long period of time, why just as many people hate the feeling of
being out of breath, and why pretty much anyone hates going to work after a
night of inadequate sleep. Science explaining these experiences does not
change the interpretation of the experiencer; science does suggest why we have
very common associations between most experiences, from pleasurable to painful
to everything between, and that speaks to us being one species. So, experience
can be explained by science and science can even predict the interpretation of
this or that experiencer, but science does not dampen phenomenal experience.
Panpsychists confuse that we have phenomenal experience with that we interpret
phenomenal experience. Physicalism is not opposed to science fully explaining
either of these and in fact, it has done much in the way of explaining both.
Strawson tries to avoid this and yet claims: “If everything that concretely
exists is intrinsically experience-involving, well, that is what the physical
turns out to be; it is what energy (another name for physical stuff) turns out
to be. This view does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, and is in no way incompatible with it” (8).
Well, if indeed it does not stand out as particularly strange against the
background of present-day science, then all concrete things can be explained
by science. This entailment seems uncontroversial and obvious for anyone
identifying as a physicalist.

Electric fields theory (EFT) of consciousness, indeed similar to panpsychism,
at least _prima facie_ , is where panpsychists should place their chips. Tam
Hunt elaborates:

In any case, if I were to assign an initial probably of 40% to each
experience, we get the following: .40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40*.40 =
.000262144 or .026%. I listed just nine events in my life in scant detail and
the probability of _you_ experiencing all nine events, even starting with a
very generous initial probability for each event of 40%, is very low. Now
imagine if I were to be as detailed as possible about as many events as I can
remember in my life; I am certain that this number will begin to approach at
least one thousand. I can, for example, talk about my earliest memory: waking
up in my crib, an infant, hungry and so delirious (probably having a
hypnogogic hallucination) that I saw a bottle floating just out of my reach as
a pendulum does, left and then right, left and then right; I reached for it
and my hand went through it and I started wailing. My dad then gave me an
actual bottle. Or I can talk about being seven or so years old and seeing a
black and white striped insect fly into my room. It landed on my black toy
chest and started to crawl like anthropods do. If I did, in fact, see a flying
centipede or millipede that day, I saw a yet to be discovered species, I might
add; I have scoured the internet for this insect and have yet to come across
anything like it. This was before smart phones, so I could not snap a picture
before it fluttered its wings and flew right back out. Hypothetically though,
if I did count a thousand experiences with an initial probability of 40%, we
get .40 ^ 1,000 or about two thousand decimal places before you arrive at any
non-zero integers. So you would get a percentage that is virtually zero.

I can think of more experiences that are unique to me, but even when assigning
a generous initial probability for any one of these events recurring, the
likelihood of all of them recurring is extremely low. What’s more is that I
have neglected a lot of variables. What was the weather like? What direction
was the wind blowing and at how many miles per hour? How old was I when all of
these things happened? I only specified the event and its location because it
is already very unlikely that you also vomited on the 6 train near Whitlock
Avenue because you had one too many drinks. I did not mention that it was
Cinco de Mayo in 2016 and after 8pm. The more and more specific I get, the
less likely it is you will share this experience. If I were to include the
people who were on the train and some of their reactions, which were
surprisingly few given the amount of people on the train, the likelihood
decreases even more.

It is standard procedure in philosophical practice to anticipate rebuttals. In
my last
[post](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/08/16/philosophy-of-
religion-series-can-naturalism-make-room-for-reincarnation/), I explored
reincarnation within a naturalistic framework. Strangely enough, my argument
leans much too heavily on the _nature_ aspect of who we are. Yes, if
consciousness existed in a vacuum, and if the _subject_ were sufficient to
account for consciousness, then my argument would be quite forceful. A
possible rebuttal takes the _nurture_ angle, arguing that the subject is not
sufficient to account for consciousness because the _object_ is just as, if
not, of greater importance when attempting to explain consciousness.

Experiences are characterized by a given duration of time, an array of
qualitative factors that produce in consciousness any number of _qualia_ that
go well beyond simply apprehending the color red or the smell of chocolate. It
is also quite possible to have an experience too often and become numb to what
makes it unique. One experience a lot of us have in common is that of going to
a movie theater. There are certain sights, sounds, textures, and smells that
are unique to the experience, but few of us can recall the buttery aroma of
popcorn somehow mixing with the dull smell of a carpet that has been sullied
and cleaned one too many times. There is the scent of leather seats (if you
can count yourself fortunate enough to have the new reclining seats, that is)
and other people. There is the texture of the seats, one’s footwear against
the carpet, in addition to one’s eyes having to adjust in a very dim setting.
So if any of my readers have ever pet a tiger in Thailand or jumped out of a
plane to skydive, then they have a unique experience, that if described in
full detail, does not align with anything I have ever experienced.

Now, that requires some explaining and this is where the _object_ comes into
focus. What makes me unique and other than you is that I have had an
innumerable set of experiences that, when taken together, you have not had.
Granted, it is very possible that we share at least one experience, even if we
live a world apart. There are billions of people in China whom I have never
met or interacted with and I can say with all the confidence in the world that
they share experiences with me: being born, coming down with a cold, sweating,
shivering, scrolling on a social media app, feeling a certain emotion like
anger or sadness, and so on. I can also say that not one of them shares every
single experience unique to me. If they are Chinese nationals, then they
probably did not grow up in the Bronx. They do not identify as Puerto Rican or
American. They do not check the Latino box when filling out a job application.
These experiences, however, are overly simplistic.

If this is the case, then identity is not so elusive after all and Buddhists
and people who deny identity are wrong. How then do any of us answer the
question: who are you? If you reply with “Sam,” then you have given us nothing
but your name. As it turns out, your name is quite common. If your name gave
us a full account of who you are, then anyone named Sam is also you. Clearly,
we both disagree with this conclusion so your name is not enough. Exercises
like this have been done ad nauseam, so I will spare you the runaround and
just give you my answer: I am a particular _experiencer_. As are you.

Given how improbable it is that the combination of experiences one has had
will be replicated to the tee in a person that, more or less, has the same
exact mental life that one does, i.e., is a one-to-one match to oneself with
respect to _nature_ , it is therefore, extremely unlikely that another _you_
or _me_ will be born no matter how long the universe goes on for. The universe
can continue to exist for quadrillions of years and I do not think it is very
probable that someone will have the combination of our respective experiences.
I am a unique experiencer because of the combination of experiences I have
had, in addition to the admittedly finite mental states that occur in me.
While those mental states very well do occur in other people, the probability
that she and I have had the same exact set of experiences is extremely low and
it is _that_ that makes us different. It is said that experiences mold us into
who we are. Given my argument here, that is likely to be the case. If you are
convinced that the unique set of experiences you have had in your lifetime
make you _you_ , then I think you cannot be convinced of naturalistic
reincarnation. What adds more force to this argument is that I have confined
it to experiences I can _remember_ despite the fact that experiences I
currently do not recall factor into the person that _I_ am. There are so many
_unconscious_ joys and traumas that explain a great deal about us. This starts
to venture into psychology, which for our current purposes is unnecessary.

Ultimately, reincarnation is incompatible with naturalism, not because it is
too mystical, but because even if we were to imagine a version of
reincarnation that is consistent with naturalism, i.e., steel man the notion
of reincarnation, one’s full set of experiences is very unlikely to recur in
the life of another person. Even twins, though sharing a lot of the same
childhood experiences, end up having different experiences that, in turn,
ensure that they are different from one another. As I have shown, it is
extremely improbable, despite a generous initial probability, for another
person to have just _nine_ of the experiences I have had, let alone a thousand
or the actual and innumerable experiences I have had in my life. Moreover, the
longer one lives, the less likely it becomes that someone else will have one’s
experiences. It is even more improbable still that someone in the far future
will have the same exact set of experiences and have the same mental life as a
centenarian in Japan, e.g. 118-year-old Tanaka Kane, who lives in Fukuoka
City. Already, you are at a disadvantage since it is impossible for you to be
born in 1903, at the time she was born, and to the same parents. It is
virtually guaranteed that your set of experiences will differ from hers.
Therein lies identity: you are a particular experiencer with a unique set of
experiences. As Dave Chapelle said when remembering his late friend Daphne
Dorman: “I am someone having a human experience.” At bottom, this is who we
all are, but as with most philosophical topics, the devil is in the details,
specifically within the details of our distinct set of experiences.

The thing is that I, as a particular experiencer, have had a plethora of
experiences in my life that are different from yours. The combination of these
experiences is a huge part of what makes me _me_. The combination of your
experiences plays a pivotal role in what makes you _you_. So it is not enough
to say that mental states are inherently finite. While it may be the case that
experiences are also finite, I need only convince you that the exact
combination of my experiences _and_ my distinctive mental states will never be
replicated again and that therefore, naturalistic reincarnation is extremely
improbable and dare I say, impossible. The sheer improbability of something,
however, does not make a thing impossible, so it is not enough to draw this
conclusion and move on.

The improbability has to be crushingly discouraging to persuade you that it is
simply more likely that naturalistic reincarnation is not the case. To show
this, I am going to begin with a generous initial probability that someone
else in the future will have any one of my experiences. I will list as many
experiences as come to mind:

  1. October 10, 2021 - 2:18 pm Pingback: [Why Reincarnation is Incompatible With Naturalism | The Philosophy Corner](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/10/10/why-reincarnation-is-incompatible-with-naturalism/)

Unfortunately, we are no longer so taken by behaviorists and know that human
beings are a lot more than simply a finite set of behaviors. We have our
preferences, things we are repulsed by, idiosyncrasies, and personalities to
speak of. Even then, I think that the combination of traits that make you
_you_ , no matter how multifarious, are finite. This implies that given a long
enough time, some sentient being, whether homo sapien or something very
similar to our own species, will come to believe in the same _you_ you believe
you are. This, to my mind, is how naturalism makes room for reincarnation.

There is no substantive self that persists, a soul as it were. There is,
however, a persistent illusion in all of us and I do not put it passed a being
eons from now to think that s/he is exactly who I think I am. Furthermore, I
do not discount the idea that s/he will _feel_ , phenomenologically speaking,
exactly as I do. There is this sense that _I am_. Whether or not identity is
real, the illusion is powerful enough to lead me to believe I am unique and
that there will never be another exactly like me. This is folly. So while
there is no substantive soul in me or in my cat, there are a number of mental
states, resulting from brain and nerve interactions, that make both of us
_feel_ like we are a unique individuals never to be replicated. I conclude
that it is far likelier that since there are not infinite mental states to go
around, there are not infinite illusions to go around either. What we refer to
as the soul or identity has its boundaries and limits. There will be another
_you_ , so in that sense, even after death, should the universe persist, _you_
will live again with no recollection of the _you_ you are right now.

Perhaps not in the next generation of life, or even in the next ten
generations, but at some point, a sentient being will be born who believes,
perhaps mistakenly, that they are me. To believe this, you need only believe
that mental states, whether tied to a brain, or to intricate nervous systems,
are finite. If such states are finite and the combination of such states and
functions are finite, then there are only so many identities to go around.
Given a long enough time, someone will come along and believe that they are
exactly who Napoleon thought he was.

Instead, I would like to focus on mental states themselves and argue that
though there are potentially innumerable brain states, they are finite. Even
if we capture every brain state of every organism in the universe, and include
also the correlate states of organisms that are conscious though lacking a
brain, the total number of mental states do not stretch infinitely.
Furthermore, the combinations of brain states, right down to the size and
function of my brain or your brain, in particular, are finite. To put it
another way, let us say that there is a limitation in the communication
between one’s prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. This may result in autism or
schizophrenia (Watson, Thomas C et al. “Back to front: cerebellar connections
and interactions with the prefrontal cortex.” _Frontiers in systems
neuroscience_ vol. 8 4. 4 Feb. 2014, doi:10.3389/fnsys.2014.00004). With these
particular disorders, there are a number of hallmark behavioral traits. This
gives some credence to the idea that brain states are fundamentally finite and
do not, as it were, stretch on forever.

When one normally thinks of reincarnation, one has in mind a caricature, the
spirit of a Jane Doe coming to inhabit a frog, unbeknownst to anyone, but
arguably Jane Doe herself. This, however, is an oversimplification. While
reincarnation is often considered an idea lauded by Eastern mystics, modern
day science can be marshaled in to lend support to the idea of reincarnation,
though in ways completely unexpected. For instance, one would usually hear the
usual tripe: since matter and energy cannot be created nor destroyed, one’s
consciousness must live on after death. The argument I want to offer is more
intricate.

Firstly, I want to begin from the finitude of brain states, an extension from
the limits of phenomenal experience. I do not disagree that there is
accompanying phenomenal experience for any interaction between an object and
our senses. I do disagree that what it is like for me to smell roses is
peculiar and markedly different from your experience of smelling a rose. I
happen to think our experiences are roughly equal. Whether you or I like the
smell of roses or not involves more than just the phenomenal experience. In
other words, there’s a lot of background noise that explains why you like the
smell more than I do. Perhaps I associate the smell of roses with wakes and
funerals rather than with candlelit dinners and weddings. The noise is not
what I want to focus on.

My resolution is that while there is no self, no concrete identity, what
persists are the illusions of a self or an identity brought about by the
limited combinations of mental states humans experience. This is why so many
of us come to have exactly the same ideas about ourselves, despite the fact
that we are different people with vastly different past experiences. This is
why mental and cognitive disorders feature an array of hallmark symptoms. To
illustrate this even better, think of the way genes encode phenotypic
features. Straight thumbs, for instance, are expressed with a capital S
whereas hitchhiker thumbs are recessive alleles expressed with a lowercase s.
This peculiarity, assuming you have it, does not belong to you. There are
other people who have hitchhiker thumb and they have it because gene
expression in their genomes have resulted in this phenotypic feature.
Likewise, our mental states, the manner in which brain regions communicate
with one another, and the way in which our particular neurons fire in our
brains create the same illusions of a static identity, packaged with a linear
life narrative that we can literally draw a straight line through from our
first memories in childhood through today.

This, in fact, falls on the horns of a dilemma Buddhists have. Recall,
Buddhists hold to the concept of _anattā_ (no self). While I may have thrown
around the word ‘identity’, this need not imply that I believe identity to be
_real_ and _substantive_. In fact, I think it is entirely illusory and that if
we interact with enough people, we will find that we have more in common than
we would like to admit. Some of us have delusions of grandeur; we have god and
savior complexes, see ourselves as fixers, and believe that there is no
problem we cannot solve. Others choose to mind their business, to not take on
a deep personal investment in the struggles even loved ones go through, and
instead choose to let the people around us work through their own problems. In
one way or another, it is likely that my two brief sketches of identity
resonate with my readers. Either you are one who suffers from delusions of
grandeur and you base even your romantic relationships on this futile attempt
to save everyone. Or, you are someone who has no deep personal investment in
the problems even the people closest to you have; this isn’t to say you refuse
to help when asked, but you prefer to let people find their own way. If one of
the two people I have described describes aspects of you, then you are further
to committing to the premise that mental states are finite and that therefore,
identities are limited.

This may seem particularly discomforting for some readers. For others, they
may think that this idea is not developed enough. I admit, the argument is
very bare bones and could use more flesh. That, however, does not mean the
argument is unsound. I happen to be convinced, first and foremost, that mental
states and what we call identities do not stretch to infinity and that
therefore, there are only so many _yous_ to go around. As such, _you_ will
live again or be reborn. This is how naturalism makes room for something as
mystical as reincarnation. The lesson is that naturalists should shun the
habit of dismissing an idea because it is religious or _prima facie_
supernatural. There might be a kernel of truth to the idea of reincarnation.
That remains to be seen, but my argument is certainly a good place to start.

Buddhists have long struggled to reconcile the idea of reincarnation with
_anattā_ , but a resolution isn’t difficult to come by. Before offering a
solution, I defer to Wildman:

This is extremely controversial for reasons we are all familiar with. That is
because everyone accepts that the original argument is sound. When speaking of
‘men’, setting aside the historical tendency to dissolve the distinction
between men and women, what is meant is “all human persons from everywhere and
at all times.” Socrates, as we know, was an ancient Greek philosopher who
reportedly died in 399 BCE. Like all people before him, and presumably all
people after him, he proved to be mortal. No human person has proven to be
immortal and therefore, the original argument holds.

With all arguments, a decision must be made. First, an assessment of the
argument form is in order. Is it a modus ponens (MP) or a modus tollens (MT)?
Perhaps it is neither and is instead, a categorical or disjunctive syllogism.
In any case, one has to decide which premise(s) is going to be negated or
whether by virtue of the argument form, one will have to change the argument
form to state the opposite. You can see this with the original example. I
could have very well negated P2 and stated “Socrates is not a man.” Socrates
is an immortal jellyfish that I tagged in the Mediterranean. Or he is an
eternal being that I met while tripping out on DMT. For purposes of the
argument, however, since he is not a man, at the very least, the question of
whether or not he is mortal is open. We would have to ask what Socrates is.
Now, if Socrates is my pet hamster, then yes, Socrates is mortal despite not
being a man. It follows that the choice of negation has to be in a place that
proves most effective. Some thought has to go into it.

Either the theist will continue to assert that the Second Way is sound,
epistemic warrant and justification be damned, or they will abandon their
dubious propositional idealism and run a soundness test. Checking whether the
Second Way or the Negated Second Way is sound would inevitably bring them into
contact with empirical evidence supporting one argument or the other. As I
have shown with the KCA, it appears that considerations of time, from a
philosophical and quantum mechanical perspective, greatly lower the
probability of the KCA being sound. This follows neatly into Aquinas’ Second
Way and as such, one has far less epistemic justification for believing the
KCA or Aquinas’ Second Way are sound. The greater justification is found in
the negated versions of these arguments.

For a more complicated treatment, Malpass and Morriston argue that “one cannot
traverse an actual infinite in finite steps” (Malpass, Alex & Morriston, Wes
(2020). Endless and Infinite. _Philosophical Quarterly_ 70 (281):830-849.). In
other words, from a mathematical point of view, T=0 is the x-axis. All of the
events after T=0 are an asymptote along the x-axis. The events go further and
further back, ever closer to T=0 but never actually touch it. For a visual
representation, see below:

Of course, matters are not so straightforward. Christian apologists offer no
arguments that are uncontroversially true like the original argument above.
Therefore, the negation strategy will prove extremely effective to disabuse
them of propositional idealism and to make them _empiricall_ y assess whether
their arguments are sound. What follows are examples of arguments for God that
have been discussed ad nauseam. Clearly, theists are not interested in
conceding. They are not interested in admitting that even one of their
arguments does not work. Sure, what you find are theists committed to Thomism,
for instance, and as such, they will reject Craig’s Kalam Cosmological
Argument (KCA) because it does not fit into their Aristotelian paradigm and
not because it is unsound. They prefer Aquinas’ approach to cosmological
arguments. What is more common is the kind of theist that ignores the
incongruity between one argument for another; since they are arguments for
God, it counts as evidence for his existence and it really does not matter
that Craig’s KCA is not Aristotelian. I happen to think that it is, despite
Craig’s denial, but I digress.

Most of our knowledge claims rest on testimony. Not everyone has performed an
experimental proof to show that the acceleration of gravity is 9.8m/s^2.
Either one learned it from a professor or read it in a physics textbook or
learned it when watching a science program. Or, they believe the word of
someone they trust, be it a friend or a grade school teacher. This does not
change that fact that if one cared to, one could exchange knowledge by way of
testimony for directly acquired knowledge by performing an experimental proof.
This is something I have done, so I do not believe on basis of mere testimony
that Newton’s law holds. I can say that it holds because I tested it for
myself.

Technically, Craig’s KCA is a _categorical syllogism_. Such syllogisms present
a universal ( **∀** ) or existential quantifier (∃); the latter is introduced
by saying _all_. Consider, “all philosophers are thinkers; all philosophers
are logicians; therefore, all thinkers are logicians.” Conversely, one could
say “no mallards are insects; some birds are mallards; therefore, some birds
are not insects.” What Craig is stating is that _all_ things that begin to
exist have a cause, so if the universe is a thing that began to exist, then it
has a cause. Alternatively, his argument is an implicit modus ponens: “if the
universe began to exist, then it has a cause; the universe began to exist;
therefore, the universe has a cause.” In any case, the negation works because
if the universe did not begin to exist, then the universe is not part of the
group of all things that have a cause.

This argument is considerably longer than the KCA, but there are still areas
where the argument can be negated. I think P1 is uncontroversial and so, I do
not mind starting from there:

If someone were completely disinterested in checking whether this argument,
which is merely a finite set of propositions, coheres with the world or
reality, I would employ my **negation strategy** : the negation of an argument
someone assumes to be sound without epistemic warrant or justification. The
strategy forces them into exploring whether their argument or its negation is
sound. Inevitably, the individual will have to abandon their bizarre
commitment to a sort of propositional idealism (namely that propositions can
_only_ be logically assessed and do not contain any real world entities
contextually or are not claims about the world). In other words, they will
abandon the notion that “All men are mortal” is a mere proposition lacking
context that is not intended to make a claim about states of affairs
objectively accessible to everyone, including the person who disagrees with
them. With that in mind, I would offer the following:

The key is to come up with a negation that is either sound or, at the very
least, free of any controversy. Straight away, I do not like P2. Moral
realists would also deny this negation because, to their minds, P2 is not
true. The controversy with P2 is not so much whether it is true or false, but
that it falls on the horns of the objectivism-relativism and moral
realism/anti-realism debates in ethics. The argument may accomplish something
with respect to countering Craig’s Moral Argument, but we are in no better
place because of it. This is when we should explore changing the argument’s
form in order to get a better negation.

To whet the appetite, let us consider a well-known deductive argument and let
us ignore, for the moment, whether it is sound:

Whether the universe is finite or eternal has been debated for millennia and
in a sense, despite changing context, the debate rages on. If the universe is
part of an eternal multiverse, it is just one universe in a vast sea of
universes within a multiverse that has no temporal beginning. Despite this,
the MT Negated KCA demonstrates how absurd the KCA is. The singularity was
already there ‘before’ the Big Bang. The Big Bang started the cosmic clock,
but the universe itself did not begin to exist. This is more plausible.
Consider that everything that begins to exist does so when the flow of time is
already in motion, i.e. when the arrow of time pointed in a given direction
due to entropic increase reducible to the decreasing temperature throughout
the universe. Nothing that has ever come into existence has done so
simultaneously with time itself because any causal relationship speaks to a
change and change requires the passage of time, but at T=0, no time has
passed, and therefore, no change could have taken place. This leads to an
asymmetry. We thus cannot speak of anything beginning to exist at T=0. The MT
Negated KCA puts cosmology in the right context. The universe did not come
into existence at T=0. T=0 simply represents the first measure of time; matter
and energy did not emerge at that point.

Of relevance is how one would proceed if one is unsure of the argument.
Thankfully, we no longer live in a world in where one would have to go out of
their way to measure the heights of the three buildings. A simple Google
search will suffice. The Freedom Tower is ~546m. The Empire State Building is
~443. The Chrysler is ~318m. Granted, this is knowledge by way of _testimony_.
I do not intend to connote religious testimony. What I intend to say is that
one’s knowledge is grounded on knowledge directly acquired by someone else. In
other words, at least one other person actually measured the heights of these
buildings and these are the measurements they got.

Finally, so that the Thomists do not feel left out, we can explore whether the
negation strategy can be applied to Aquinas’ Five Ways. For our purposes, the
Second Way is closely related to the KCA and would be defeated by the same
considerations. Of course, we would have to negate the Second Way so that it
is vulnerable to the considerations that cast doubt on the KCA. The Second Way
can be stated as follows:

The implication here is that _time began to exist_ , but _the universe did not
begin to exist_. A recent paper implies that this is most likely the case
([Quantum Experiment Shows How Time ‘Emerges’ from
Entanglement](https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/quantum-experiment-
shows-how-time-emerges-from-entanglement-d5d3dc850933). _The Physics arXiv
Blog_. 23 Oct 2013. Web.). The very hot, very dense singularity before the
emergence of time at T=0 would have been subject to quantum mechanics rather
than the macroscopic forces that came later, e.g., General Relativity. As
such, the conditions were such that entanglement could have resulted in the
emergence of time in our universe, but not the emergence of the universe. All
of the matter and energy were already present before the clock started to
tick. Conversely, if the universe is akin to a growing runner, then the
toddler is at the starting line before the gun goes off. The sound of the gun
starts the clock. The runner starts running sometime _after_ she hears the
sound. As she runs, she goes through all the stages of childhood, puberty,
adolescence, adulthood, and finally dies. Crucially, the act of her running
and her growth do not begin until after the gun goes off. Likewise, no changes
take place at T=0; all changes take place _after_ T=0. While there is this
notion of entanglement, resulting in a change occurring before the clock even
started ticking, quantum mechanics demonstrates that quantum changes do not
require time and in fact, may result in the emergence of time. Therefore, it
is plausible that though time began to exist at the Big Bang, the universe did
_not_ begin to exist ** _—_** thus, making the MT Negated KCA sound. The KCA
is therefore, false.

Every deductive argument can be negated. I consider this an uncontroversial
statement. The problem is, there are people who proceed as though deductive
arguments speak to an _a priori truth_. The Freedom Tower is taller than the
Empire State Building; the Empire State Building is taller than the Chrysler
Building; therefore, the Freedom Tower is taller than the Chrysler Building.
This is an example of an _a priori truth_ because given that one understands
the concepts of taller and shorter, the conclusion follows uncontroversially
from the premises. This is one way in which the soundness of an argument can
be assessed.

Let us explore whether Craig’s Moral Argument falls victim to the negation
strategy. Craig’s Moral Argument is as follows:

> **Negated Second Way**
>
> We perceive a series of efficient causes of things in the world.
>
> Nothing exists prior to itself.
>
> Therefore nothing [in the world of things we perceive] is the efficient
> cause of itself.
>
> If a previous efficient cause does not exist, neither does the thing that
> results (the effect).
>
> Therefore if the earlier thing in a series does not exist, nothing in the
> series exists.
>
> If the series of efficient causes extends ad infinitum into the past, then
> there would be things existing now.
>
> That is plainly true (i.e., efficient causes, per Malpass and Morriston,
> extend infinitely into the past or, the number of past efficient causes is a
> potential infinity).
>
> Therefore efficient causes do extend ad infinitum into the past.
>
> Therefore it is not necessary to admit a first efficient cause, to which
> everyone gives the name of God.

Likewise, the choice has to be made when confronting Craig’s Moral Argument.
Craig’s Moral Argument is a modus tollens. For the uninitiated, it simply
states: [((p –> q) ^ ~q) –> ~p] (Potter, A. (2020). The rhetorical structure
of Modus Tollens: An exploration in logic-mining. _Proceedings of the Society
for Computation in Linguistics, 3_ , 170-179.). Another way of putting it is
that one is _denying the consequent_. That is precisely what Craig does.
“Objective moral values do not exist” is the consequent q. Craig is saying ~q
or “Objective moral values do exist.” Therefore, one route one can take is
keeping the argument form and negating P1, which in turn negates P2.

The arguments for God, no matter how old or new, simple or complex, do not
work because not only do they rely on directionally motivated and patently
biased reasoning, but because when testing for soundness, being sure not to
exclude any pertinent evidence, the arguments turn out to be unsound. In the
main, they all contain controversial premises that do not work unless one
_already_ believes in God. So there is a sense in which these arguments exist
to give believers a false sense of security or more pointedly, a false sense
of certainty. Unlike my opponents, I am perfectly content with being wrong,
with changing my mind, but the fact remains, theism is simply not the sort of
belief that I give much credence to. Along with the [Vagueness
Strategy](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2019/06/17/arguments-
from-vagueness-against-the-so-called-god-of-monotheism/), the Negation
Strategy is something that should be in every atheist’s toolbox.

This is a valid modus ponens. I have changed the argument form of Craig’s
Moral Argument and I now have what I think to be a better negation of his
argument. From P2, atheists can find satisfaction. This is the epistemic
proposition atheists are committed to. The conclusion also alleviates any
concerns moral realists might have had with the MT Negated Moral Argument. For
my own purposes, I think this argument works better. That, however, is beside
the point. The point is that this forces theists to either justify the
premises of Craig’s Moral Argument, i.e. prove that the argument is sound, or
assert, on the basis of mere faith, that Craig’s argument is true. In either
case, one will have succeeded in either forcing the theist to abandon their
propositional idealism, in getting them to test the argument against the world
as ontologically construed or in getting them to confess that they are
indulging in circular reasoning and confirmation bias, i.e. getting them to
confess that they are irrational and illogical. Both of these count as
victories. We can explore whether other arguments for God fall on this sword.

Again, negation can take place in two places: P1 or P2. Negating P1, however,
does not make sense. Negating P2, like in the case of his Moral Argument,
changes the argument form; this is arguable and more subtle. So we get the
following:

Ultimately, one either succeeds at making the theist play the game according
to the right rules or getting them to admit their beliefs are not properly
epistemic at all; instead, they believe by way of blind faith and all of their
redundant arguments are exercises in circular reasoning and any pretense of
engaging the evidence is an exercise in confirmation bias. Arguments for God
are a perfect example of directionally motivated reasoning (see Galef, Julia.
_The Scout Mindset: Why Some People See Things Clearly and Others Don’t_. New
York: Portfolio, 2021. 63-66. Print). I much prefer accuracy motivated
reasoning. We are all guilty of motivated reasoning, but _directionally_
motivated reasoning is indicative of irrationality and usually speaks to the
fact that one holds beliefs that do not square with the facts. Deductive
arguments are only useful insofar as premises can be supported by evidence,
which therefore makes it easier to show that an argument is sound. This is why
we can reason that if Socrates is a man, more specifically, the ancient Greek
philosopher that we all know, then Socrates was indeed mortal and that is why
he died in 399 BCE. Likewise, this is why we cannot reason that objective
morality can only be the case if the Judeo-Christian god exists, that if the
universe began to exist, God is the cause, and that if the series of efficient
causes cannot regress infinitely and must terminate somewhere, they can only
terminate at a necessary first cause, which some call God. These arguments can
be negated and the negations will show that they are either absurd or that the
reasoning in the arguments is deficient and rests on the laurels of
directionally motivated reasoning due to a bias for one’s religious faith
rather than on the bedrock of carefully reasoned, meticulously demonstrated,
accuracy motivated reasoning which does not ignore or omit pertinent facts.

This, in a nutshell, is the Ignorance Defense. Humans are, in other words,
ignorant of God’s will and our wisdom pales in comparison to his. Nielsen’s
contention, however, has the makings of a perfect defeater. All that is needed
is to see his objection from the point of view of one of God’s attributes.
Nielsen states that “it looks more like, if he exists and is all powerful and
all knowing, that then he more likely to be evil” and adds that “we see that
all the same he _might possibly be_ , as Jewish, Christian, and Islamic
religions say he is, perfectly good. But we cannot see _that_ he is. The
Mosaic God looks, to understate it, petty, unjust, and cruel to us” (Ibid.).
This defeater is perfected if we see this from the point of view of God’s
omniscience. God would know that we would be incapable of seeing that he is
good in light of natural evil. This evil is, in fact, gratuitous. God would
have seen, by way of his omniscience, that the quantity of natural evil in the
world would be enough to drive so many to doubt. This apart from contradictory
revelations, the limited range and capacity of Christianity, i.e., its
incapacity to appeal to people of other cultures, e.g., Jews, Muslims, Hindus,
and indigenous people across every populated continent, and the negative
evidence against the existence of the Judeo-Christian god.

Contingency arguments only accomplish one thing: they point to the existence
of metaphysical necessities, quite possibly something like brute facts, that
can be explained by something more concrete like physical necessity. In [my
overview of Rasmussen’s recent contingency
argument](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/03/06/rebuking-
rasmussens-geometric-argument/), I go over what this looks like and it is more
plausible than crossing the infinite chasm between a necessary cause and a
necessary being on blind faith alone. In any case, since we cannot know what
necessity is _really_ like and since we cannot visit the realm of necessity,
it is best we accept our ignorance on this matter. The intuition of skeptical
theism undermines what many theists consider one of the stronger lines of
argumentation in favor of theism.

b) It begs the question because it really is no different from someone saying
“just wait and see!” Many people on all sides died waiting and seeing and per
Schellenberg, honestly sought divinity their entire lives and came up empty.
If God had a better track record of making do on past atrocities, then we
would be able to inductively reason, as many of us do with science, in this
manner. The thing is, it looks like the bills for the Holocaust and slavery
are overdue and all of us, living ~80 and ~450 years respectively, after these
atrocities happened, cannot even begin to causally connect potential goods
that God has deployed with the intention of paying this debt. Perhaps it is
too much to expect God to pay that debt because those were human crimes; but I
can also think of disasters, diseases, pandemics, mass extinctions, and other
natural evils that are overdue and again, I am not sure what goods are
intended to repay the extinctions of all of our hominid cousins, for example.

Now to turn my attention to an argument that subsumes the observations of The
Evidential Problem of Evil and The Divine Hiddenness Argument. This argument
is novel, forceful, and to my mind, defeats the idea of not just perfect
being, omni-god theism, but theism overall. Weidner already observes the
following: “After all, the hiddenness argument, if successful, helps us see
the deficiencies of personal perfect being theism” (Weidner, ibid.). My next
argument should help one see the deficiencies of theism in general.

Weidner’s next stop is to grapple with the conclusion of My Argument From
Assailability: “if we find in any being, a characteristic that is assailable,
then we have no reason to call it a god.” How is a non-perfect theistic being
different from an alien, one might ask. Crucially, if per the hiddenness and
evil arguments, God does not seem open to being in a relationship with all
human beings and does not intervene when great atrocities happen, then we have
located an assailable characteristic. How does an omnipotent or, at least, an
incredibly powerful being succumb to bystander effect? Even if God is not all-
powerful and could not snap the Nazis out of existence, if he is at least
powerful enough to assume a disguise and poison Hitler and his top advisers,
why not step in and prevent the Holocaust?

RC*: The condition of the argument is as follows: there is a difference
between the phenomenal experience of human beings and that of earthworms (if
it is even appropriate to think that worms have phenomenal experience). Even
if earthworms lack phenomenal consciousness, according to some philosophers,
we certainly have phenomenal consciousness and as such, there is a distance
between our experience and theirs.

RC2 An infinite god or even a vastly powerful deity would have an infinite or
incalculable phenomenal distance from humans.

Prior to discussing Schellenberg’s argument in some detail, it is crucial to
understand why skeptical theism fails:

This matches Plantinga’s Ignorance Defense one-to-one. There is therefore, no
need to belabor the point. My concern is twofold: the failure of skeptical
theism should be clear and since this appeal to human ignorance is an
obstinate roadblock borne of a reluctance to accept an atheistic conclusion,
it is crucial to develop arguments that make use of its faulty intuition and
arguments that leave no room for a skeptical theistic response. In other
words, if the intuition can be turned on its head, in a perfect example of how
to employ the double standard and outsider tests (see Galef, Julia. _The Scout
Mindset: Why Some People See Things Clearly and Others Don’t_. New York:
Portfolio, 2021. 63-66. Print), perhaps the theist is not in a position to see
the vast shortcomings of skeptical theism. This is what I want to do because I
am at a loss when it comes to understanding why anyone would think such a
response works when confronting The Evidential Problem of Evil and
Schellenberg’s Divine Hiddenness Argument. For our purposes, I will set aside
stating explicitly The Evidential Problem of Evil, as I think it is
unnecessary review for the initiated. Schellenberg’s Divine Hiddenness
Argument, on the other hand, is not as familiar, even to the thoroughly
initiated. Thankfully, Veronika Weidner has explicitly stated the argument
accurately:

The intuition of skeptical theism, as I made clear at the outset, can be used
to cast doubt on contingency arguments across the board. Aside from the fact
that there is a chasm between a necessary cause, e.g., something like the Big
Bang, and a necessary being, we can assert that we should be skeptical of our
ability to discern what a necessary being is. How do we know that it is _one_
necessary being as opposed to many? If a Triune god solves the one-many
problem, then why not the Divine Septad of Zoroastrianism? Since we cannot
know what the realm of necessity is like, we should refrain from making these
kinds of arguments.

In the end, I think the lines of argumentation I have pursued here are by no
means exhaustive, in that a lot more can be said about evil, suffering,
hiddenness, God’s lack of supererogative agency, and an indifference stemming
from the incalculable, if not, infinite phenomenal distance he has from us. I
defer to Rieux: “No Father. I’ve a very different idea of love. And until my
dying day I shall refuse to love a scheme of things in which children are put
to torture” (Camus, Ibid., 218).

We are then asked “to stick with a belief in what we see to be some kind of
_possibility_ , namely that God is, after all, appearances to the contrary
notwithstanding, perfectly good” (Ibid.). This as an obstinate appeal to the
very faith that needs to be substantiated. Furthermore, this appears to imply
the superiority of faith over reason. Like Galileo, who no doubt said this
with a different sentiment, I “do not feel obliged to believe that same God
who endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect had intended for us to forgo
their use” (Galilei, Galileo, [“Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina of
Tuscany, 1615”](https://digitalcommons.bard.edu/sr-instruct/97/) (2013).
_Instructional Resources_. 97.).

Skeptical Theism is overtly present in Plantinga’s Ignorance Defense. It must
be noted here that he does not call it that. The monicker makes sense because
it relies on human ignorance in order to work. In other words, the defense
states that since human wisdom is incomparable to God’s, we cannot know why he
allows evil. Moreover, since it is reasonable that he has some reason,
unbeknownst to us, for allowing evil, we cannot reasonably blame God for the
evil in the world. Of Plantinga’s explications, Kai Nielsen says the
following:

c) The whole accounting that is done really puts a lack of value on human life
that turns out to be nihilistic and even fatalistic. The Black Plague wiped
out millions. Are we really to believe any good repaid that debt? Are we
supposed to buy that the life of a child, whose loss emotionally crippled her
mother, is worth so little that we can just make do with the fact that some
future kid was saved from danger in her place? That does nothing at all to
alleviate the suffering the child and her mother experienced, so that is
another issue, one of currency: what is the value of this coin God is paying
his debts with and how exactly does it exchange with the coin in the sometimes
distant past?

That, however, falls on the horns of my Argument From Assailability and so,
Theism is defeated in all its iterations. This is to say nothing about the
fact that even a finite deity would be far more capable of supererogatory acts
than we are. In any case, the intuition of my supererogative argument can be
turned on its head. We can deduce something about God’s power given this lack.
God must be much weaker than a hypothetical infinite being due to the fact
that he remains a bystander, utterly apathetic to even the worst atrocities
known to man ** _—_** even ones we played no part in causing. This is an
assailable characteristic. We therefore, have no obligation whatsoever to
worship a being that is apparently weaker than ourselves. As Tracie Harris
famously said: “If I could stop a person from raping a child I would. That is
the difference between me and your God” (Bennett-Smith, Meredith. [“‘Atheist
Experience’ TV Host Shocked By Caller’s Statement About Child Rape
(Video)”](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/atheist-experience-child-
rape_n_2434198). _Huffington Post_. 9 Jan 2013. Web). Ultimately, if God
appears to be this much weaker than human beings, who can potentially lose
their lives when intervening on the behalf of another person, it is far more
probable that God does not exist.

B) On exclusivism, many of today’s atheists are eternally lost because evil
and hiddenness were just too persuasive and the goods never came due within
our lifetimes. On universalism, this is all arbitrary. This can be conjoined
to Street’s recent response to skeptical theism: we are free to indulge moral
aporia because no matter what we believe or not, we will ultimately be saved
(see Street, S. (2014). If everything happens for a reason, then we don’t know
what reasons are: Why the price of theism is normative skepticism. In M.
Bergmann & P. Kain (Eds.), _Challenges to moral and religious belief:
Disagreement and evolution_ (pp. 172–192). Oxford: Oxford University Press.).
So talk of evil and hiddenness and unknown goods to account for them ends up
being null.

RC1 Human beings have phenomenal distance from earthworms and therefore, are
indifferent to them, e.g. we walk through a parking lot on a rainy day and
probably trample dozens of them underfoot with no second thought.

This novel argument, not to be confused with Mander’s “Does God know what it
is like to be me?” (see Mander, W.J. (2002), Does God Know What It is Like to
be Me?. The Heythrop Journal, 43: 430-443.
<https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-2265.00203>) completely evades skeptical theism.
It is an argument from analogy in where an observation about human behavior is
mapped onto God. The argument has been alluded to before, but as far as I
know, has not been formally stated or given a name.

a) It is utilitarian in its analysis. The evil and hiddenness we experience
are lesser in magnitude when compared to the goods that await us, be it in
heaven or by way of some earthly recompense. The greater good overtones are
palpable. I cannot see how a being who is appealed to as the objective and
perfect moral standard can subscribe to utilitarianism given its shortcomings.

I have a sneaking suspicion that theists feel the gnaw of these defeaters.
Atheists certainly do. This then becomes an exercise of being overly
charitable to a kind of argument that can never prove successful. If skeptical
theism fails, it is a thread that should be cut and discarded. There are a
couple of minor problems that are important as well:

A) Even if we grant that unforeseen goods balance the scales, as it were, i.e.
justifies the 1,800 cancer-related deaths of children per year in the United
States, there is no way for finite human minds to causally connect these
deaths with the goods whenever they arrive; the most we can do is callously
reason that their deaths are akin to necessary sacrifices that enable us to
eventually find a cure—which is related to minor problem (a) below and more
importantly, is not something we should ever give God credit for; developing
cures is a slow, painstaking process that does not involve anything like
putative revelation or God whispering the secrets to a much needed vaccine in
a doctor’s ear. There is also the issue that the goods may arrive well after
our lifetimes, which segues into the next problem.

The reason Aquinas and others maximized God to have infinite capacities in all
respects is because theists already saw the crippling limitations of a god
with finite abilities. The question would immediately follow: what motivation
is there to worship a being that is not perfect? Infinity entails
supererogative capacity. God would be able to give an infinite amount of love,
kinship, succor, power, knowledge, and presence and still retain an infinite
amount of each. So why does he seem to blithely refuse to commit to this?
Perfect and infinite personal being theism is defeated by the combination of
Schellenberg’s Divine Hiddenness Argument, The Evidential Problem of Evil, and
my argument from God’s apparent lack of supererogatory agency. What is left is
non-perfect being theism.

Therefore, there must exist the necessary being that is the cause of all
contingent being (credit: [Queens Community
College](https://www.qcc.cuny.edu/socialsciences/ppecorino/intro_text/Chapter%203%20Religion/Cosmological.htm))

This argument avoids the nauseating intuition of skeptical theism as it cannot
appeal to any ignorance we have. One thing we are not ignorant of, as evil and
hiddenness make clear, is that either God does not exist or if any gods exist,
they are astoundingly indifferent to us. Camus, in _The Plague_ , observes
through the character of Tarrou that if God is not going to provide succor in
times of great atrocity, it is up to us to take the helm and do something
about our plights. Conjoined to his scathing criticisms of the religious
propensity to prefer the abstract over the concrete is Camus’ clearsighted
focus on God’s absence or indifference, for even as Jacques Othon dies in
agony and Father Paneloux shouts out “My God, spare this child!,” the child
dies writhing in pain and wailing across the halls of the auxiliary hospital
(Camus, Albert. _The Plague_. New York: Vintage International Books. 217.
Web.). This argument is yet another powerful blow against personal being
theism because a friend is there in times of need and a father who loves his
children, all the more so. No appeal to our ignorance, as my defeaters make
clear, can be marshaled in to salvage the notion of the existence of a
personal being who loves us and has our well-being and prosperity in mind. The
absence or more tentatively, the indifference of God should disabuse one of
the belief in a personal being who loves us infinitely.

What makes this argument inductive is P3 and P4. P3 and P4 hold hitherto and
thus, there is the tacit assumption that they will hold going forward. In
other words, that the future will resemble the past.

Isms abound and nuance is sorely needed. I think my readers ought to follow my
lead and shed their isms. In place of these various isms, they should offer
clear definitions of what they mean by these isms. I think definitions are
more robust and are more capable of giving, especially detractors, an idea of
what a label means in practice. I will now outline a few of my various isms
and unpack them, so that people can start to see the absurdity of opposing
some of them. In place of these labels, I will offer explanations for why I
identity with these views.

Another route such an atheist takes is the attempt to show that any given
attributes of God are irreconcilable.

Analytic atheism also attempts to answer the question: what is atheism? To
accomplish this, however, the normative component has to be consulted. The
analytic component will provide theories of atheism or more simply, accounts
of what atheism should be, therefore providing possible answers to the
question of normative atheism. The analytic component is therefore,
responsible for determining which account best captures what atheism is or
alternatively, what an atheist is.

Naturalism is another argument available to an atheist operating under
inductive atheology. This is, in fact, the prevalent approach among modern day
atheists. Atheists may disagree on the details and therefore, espouse
different sorts of naturalism. However, the more prominent forms are
metaphysical and methodological. Methodological naturalism has two primary
forms: constructive and deflationary. Deflationary is based on–not
exclusively–the Natural Ontological Attitude (NOA). Arthur Fine describes it
as follows:

That leaves open the question as to why people on the right see these
positions as fundamentally opposed to their brand of politics. Again, if your
political party imposes these discriminatory and even racist views on you, it
is good sign that you should renounce it. There are ways to be fiscally
conservative, a proponent of small government, and so on without subscribing
to views that promote racial, gender, and wealth inequality. I fail to see how
what I have had outlined is unclear or nonsensical. The isms, once unpacked,
should not be as controversial. This is why I prefer stating my positions
clearly, so that there is no room for misconstruing, misrepresenting, straw
manning, and so on. There is, in my book, a difference between an opponent and
an enemy. The enmity I reserve for my enemies has everything to do with the
fact that they think their ignorance is better than my knowledge, their apathy
superior to my empathy, their desire to oppress groups they dislike equal to
my desire for equality. Opponents, by contrast, can have their minds changed.
The omission of relevant facts is not the same as ignorance. My enemies intend
to ignore that which disagrees with or defeats their views and more
importantly, they intend to cause harm to people like myself, so they do so by
weaponizing their right to vote to further marginalized groups they want to
harm. Then they pretend to be innocent because they are not drawing a firearm.
They might as well. Voting for a candidate that does not care about the
plights of minorities, women, non-Christians, etc. is a deliberate attempt to
harm these groups. You are not innocent.

What an atheist is, is perhaps best defined by the approach s/he chooses. The
approach chosen or a combination of these approaches might help us to arrive
at a better definition of atheism. There’s fallibilism, deductive atheology,
and inductive atheology. The latter two are encompassed by evidentialism. This
position is arguably most familiar to modern atheists:

> Feminism is one of the oldest and most powerful social movements in history;

Where such authorities are silent, metaphysical naturalism is capable of
providing possible answers. Take, for instance, consciousness. Metaphysical
naturalism can offer cogent explanations within the _physicalist_ framework.
For instance, with respect to consciousness, some naturalists have offered
some version of supervenience. On fallibilism, an atheist can argue that a
theist has come to a given conclusion because he hasn’t considered all the
relevant evidence (McCormick, Ibid.). In fact, part of this attitude plays a
role in discussions between theists and atheists. Theists, generally speaking,
make it quite obvious that they are not aware of all of the relevant evidence.
William Lane Craig, for example, employs a perfunctory or selective grasp of
cosmology in order to support his KCA. It is reasonable to conclude that if he
were aware of all of the evidence or if he did not omit counter-evidence, his
conclusion would be different. Unfortunately, this might be too generous.
Craig has been made aware of the evidence and regardless of the fact, he still
chooses to endorse the KCA. So in some cases, it is not just that a theist’s
knowledge is fallible, but it is that they disregard the fact and do not care
to correct it. Even worse, apologists are in the habit of omitting evidence to
the contrary.

The same applies to Asian Americans, who have recently become the target of
hate crimes across the country. Implicit here is that I am opposed to anyone
who endorses stereotypes about ethnic groups. So when the former President
joked about the “Kung Flu” and blamed China repeatedly for the COVID-19
outbreak, that was one of the many reasons I opposed him, his administration,
and his supporters. It is absurd to me that right-wingers in America are
roundly opposed to racial equality. They are also opposed to women securing
equality. There is a sense in which my political opponents are wholly aware of
what these labels mean and yet, they routinely choose to ignore the
definitions, no matter how clearly they are explained. It is not any lack of
clarity or sense on my part, but rather an obstinate decision to oppose
progress of this sort at every turn. Political affiliation should not keep
anyone from accepting my definitions or identifying with them. If your
political party prohibits you from even seeing the need for racial equality,
abandon the party or admit to having abandoned your moral integrity. There are
no two ways about it.

Proponents of Capitalism are enamored with the idea of Capitalism. They,
however, ignore the reality of it. Inequality the world over is perpetuated by
Western ideas and interference. In the year that COVID-19 has wreaked havoc in
the United States, workers have lost over $3.7 trillion to date while the
wealth of top billionaires has increased by $3.9 trillion. This can be seen as
one of the largest redistributions of wealth in history (see
[here](https://www.businessinsider.com/workers-lost-37-trillion-in-earnings-
during-the-pandemic-2021-1) and
[here](https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-made-39-trillion-during-
the-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccines-2021-1)). A lot more can be said about
Capitalism, perhaps in a separate post for another day. The point I am making
now is that the labels of Black Lives Matter, feminist, anti-Capitalist, and
the like do not necessarily pertain to Far Left politics. Once these labels
are made explicit, in that one makes clear what they mean in practice, it
should strike anyone as absurd to be diametrically opposed to these positions.

An atheist operating under inductive atheology has several possible
approaches. Whether or not one can prove a negative is too tangential a topic
to cover here, but assuming it’s possible, one could offer Michael Martin’s
argument:

> Religions, whether theisms or not, are belief-systems (though this is not
> all they are) which involve belief in spiritual realities. Even Buddhism,
> which has neither God nor worship, has a belief in what Buddhists take to be
> spiritual realities and this is incompatible with naturalism as is theism as
> well, which, at least as usually understood, is a form of supernaturalism.
> Naturalism, where consistent, is an atheism.

Lastly, the definition “lack of belief in gods” is inadequate because it
alludes to everyday beliefs. It is correct to say I _lack_ or do not have the
belief that Jesus died for my sins and resurrected three days later, and then
ascended to the right hand of the Father where he now intercedes on my behalf.
Religious beliefs of this sort are not properly epistemic beliefs, which are
“the attitude[s] we have, roughly, whenever we take something to be the case
or regard it as true” (Schwitzgebel, Eric.
[“Belief”](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/). _Stanford Encyclopedia
of Philosophy_. 2019. Web.). Atheists, therefore, have the epistemic belief
that the available evidence makes it much more probable than not that there
are no gods or spiritual entities whatsoever. Naturalism, whether some of us
like it or not, is a framework that has imposed itself on us. Even in cases
where we assume supernatural or paranormal explanations, thorough
investigation renders a much more mundane explanation. For some people, it is
difficult to accept that the world is not fantastical. Severed limbs do not
regenerate in the name of Jesus, people do not rise from the dead when a spell
is invoked, and our ancestors do not protect us from physical harm. Thorough
investigations only yield naturalistic, reproducible explanations. So when
someone proclaims a belief that does not speak to knowledge or truth, but
rather, faith, I can definitely say I do not share or that I lack that belief.
Now when speaking of properly epistemic beliefs, I have the attitude that
atheism is the case; atheism is true in that the various claims of religion do
not hold up to scrutiny and that moreover, gods are entirely absent in the
scope of all of our explanations. In other words, star formation, planet
formation, the arrangement of the earliest, simplest metabolisms, the
evolution of species, and ultimately, every model of the universe’s origin do
not require a god in order to make sense.

Metaphysical naturalism is a robust worldview that often requires lengthy
elucidation. This has been done by, for example, Richard Carrier who states:

> Metaphysical naturalism seeks to explain every feature of our reality
> through only natural entities and causes, without the need of god(s) or the
> supernatural in any part of one’s worldview and life philosophy. In other
> words, a “big picture” explanation of reality can be reached without any
> appeal to religion, making religions such as Christianity unnecessary and
> extraneous to answering the big questions in life.

When atheism is spelled out in this much detail, detractors are given no room
to disingenuously offer a definition they prefer, one that allows them to
malign atheists and misrepresent what they stand for. The label of atheism is
futile. The definition or perhaps better said, the practice clearly spells out
what it is that I stand for. The same applies to naturalism. The label no
longer applies. Instead, I prefer to make explicit what I mean by it. Kai
Nielsen explains the intimate connection between atheism and naturalism best:

In the past, I have used this term and I have done so to differentiate myself
from _Democrats_. I am not a Centrist, a sycophant who condones incompetence
and corruption on both sides while pretending that they are both exemplary.
Neither political party in the United States is morally admirable. While it is
the case that Democrats are marginally better, there is still a lot that they
get wrong, hence my anti-Democratic, anti-Capitalist stances. I do not support
the American idea of Democracy because, like Mbembe, I recognize that it has a
nocturnal body: colonialism and every human rights violation that has followed
from it from slavery to the Jim Crow era to mass incarceration of Blacks after
a fabricated crack-cocaine epidemic. The United States is a hegemony, a
pseudo-Empire precisely because it destabilizes entire regions by rightfully
overthrowing despots and making the critical mistake of leaving a power vacuum
in their place. Terrorist factions are just a small part of this country
reaping what it sowed, but I digress.

NOA is an alternative to scientific realism and anti-realism. “Both realism
and anti-realism add an unwanted philosophical gloss to science” (Ibid.).
Therefore, the position neither agrees with scientific realism nor anti-
realism. At first glance, NOA may sound exactly like scientific realism, but
there are key differences that should be considered (e.g. the correspondence
theory of truth doesn’t factor into Fine’s NOA). Constructive naturalism
differs from NOA because it “involves commitment to a definite method for
resolving ontological matters” (Ibid.).Such a naturalist may make use of, for
example, Quine’s Naturalized Epistemology.

Ultimately, labels in and of themselves are futile. We should do away with
labels and instead flesh out what we stand for. This leaves little room for
error and leaves our enemies fully exposed. This is not to say that people
cannot disagree with atheism and naturalism, for instance. They are more than
welcome to. What this does mean is that they cannot make the vacuous claim
that I suppress God in my unrighteousness or that I hate God or that I choose
to not believe because I prefer to indulge sinful concupiscence. These are
comfortable things Christians say to avoid the fact that people have good
reasons for not believing in God. My robust descriptions of atheism and
naturalism leave no room for speculation of the sort. It gives them no space
at all to go with a definition that allows them to slander people like myself.
Labels do not accomplish this. Fuller descriptions of what is meant by a label
go much further. Let us abandon our labels and instead, describe in greater
detail what we stand for.

Atheism is not merely an epistemic stance concerning belief in god, but a
robust philosophical position that contains an analytic component. Analytic
atheism is concerned with what is meant by theism and what is meant by God.
Atheists, however, will not always agree with the answers provided by theists.
A theist may respond to the first question and say that God is existence. An
atheist might object by saying that such a definition is inconsistent with
what theists commonly profess and that what they usually profess is much more
elementary. God, for example, is man-like. He is pleased or displeased; given
the latter, he is prone to anger. Furthermore, he purportedly has properties
that cannot be attributed to mere existence: he is omniscient, omnipotent,
eternal, timeless. The atheist could also respond by stating that defining God
as existence is much too vague. The aim of a definition is description; this
definition, however, fails to describe what is meant by God.

_A priori_ arguments fall in the purview of deductive atheology. Such atheists
would argue that the traditional view of God is incoherent. Such a God is not
possible on this view. The characteristics God purportedly has are
contradictory either in and of themselves or when one attempts to reconcile
them. Take for example J.L Mackie’s explication of the Omnipotence Paradox:
“can an omnipotent being make things which he cannot subsequently control? Or,
what is practically equivalent to this, can an omnipotent being make rules
which then bind himself?” (Mackie, J. L. 1955. Evil and omnipotence. _Mind_ 64
(254): 200-212. Available on
[web](https://href.li/?http://www.ditext.com/mackie/evil.html).). This is a
more generalized version of the Omnipotence Paradox, which usually asks: can
God create a stone he cannot lift? Therefore, the paradox can be viewed as an
argument attempting to show that omnipotence is incoherent in and of itself.
The argument attempts to accomplish this by dividing omnipotence into two
components, which I call _functional_ and _physical_. Functional omnipotence
is the capacity to _will_ anything whilst physical omnipotence is the capacity
to _do_ anything. Therefore, the argument attempts to show that it is possible
that God could will something he cannot do, in Mackie’s case, will something
that he cannot control or in the general case, will the existence of a stone
so heavy that he cannot complete the particular task of lifting it.

Likewise, there should be no opposition at all when I say that Black people
and minorities, more generally, should be equal to Whites. There is nothing
wrong with saying that if a Black man commits a crime or fails to comply with
police, he should not be gunned down. White men have committed crimes on a
much larger scale and were escorted away in handcuffs. White men do not have
to worry about police officers kneeling on their necks or shooting 41 rounds
at them. Timothy McVeigh murdered 168 people, including 19 children, in an act
of domestic terrorism, and he walked away with his life (Gumbel, Andrew.
[“Oklahoma City bombing: 20 years later, key questions remain
unanswered”](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/13/oklahoma-city-
bombing-20-years-later-key-questions-remain-unanswered). _Guardian_. 13 Apr
2015. Web.). That is because he was given the right to a fair trail. In this
country, a Black man selling loose cigarettes on a corner can be the victim of
extrajudicial execution. There is nothing controversial about saying that even
the life of an accused Black criminal matters. Innocent until proven guilty
applies to Black people or at least, it _should_ apply to Black people.

What kind of change is the label of feminism about? Feminism concerns securing
equality for women. Women should have the same opportunities men have. Women
should have the same rights men have. Women should be respected in their
careers the way men are; they should be paid equally. There should be no sex-
based differences in academia, the workplace, at home, or anywhere else. When
this is spelled out, it is an uncontroversial perspective. There should be no
reason for anyone to oppose the affirmation that women should be equal to men.

Fugitives are the people anti-feminists get these ideas from, young girls who
are themselves anti-feminists or who identify a feminists and confess to
things that are not at all in keeping with the movement: that feminists hate
men; that feminists want to exclude them; that feminists seek female dominance
and perhaps a matriarchy; that feminists are looking to devalue masculine
attributes; that feminists ignore the effects the patriarchy has on men and
that they, in fact, ignore men’s issues across the board. These ideas are not
true to feminism, but there’s still the question as to why people think they
are. Mackay has a succinct summary of feminism and not surprisingly, she
alludes to common misconceptions:

The Fourth Wave may be the most powerful wave yet, but a glaring issue limits
its power: there are people who not only misunderstand feminism, but also
either stand against feminism or misrepresent feminism. The former and the
latter are more related than one realizes. Those who misrepresent feminism are
very often responsible for those who stand against it. Some Christians and
Muslims believe that women are inferior to men and will therefore oppose
feminism by default, but there are anti-feminists who do not have religious
reasons for opposing feminism. Their reasons are based on the
misunderstandings of self-proclaimed feminists.

Perhaps the final route such an atheist can take is to argue that the failure
of theistic arguments entails atheism. In other words, since arguments for God
fail, it is reasonable to hold that god does not exist. Such an atheist, for
example, will argue that since the Kalam Cosmological Argument fails to prove
that God created the universe, we should believe that such an agent did not
create the universe. Alternatively, she will argue that since the Ontological
Argument fails to show the existence of a necessary being, this being is
instead impossible. Whether or not these arguments hold are of no interest at
the time. This is, however, how such an atheist will proceed.

Josephus does mention the imprisonment and death of John the Baptist, but he
disagrees with the Gospels on some details, e.g., why he was killed; where he
was imprisoned. Ultimately, the historicity of John’s baptisms doesn’t imply
that he baptized Jesus. Historical people and places are commonly incorporated
into myths, e.g., Darius I in the book of Daniel; Pharaoh (which one?) in
Exodus. Therefore, it is our right to ignore Josephus’ mention of John the
Baptist given these reasons.

Ultimately, my purpose was to demonstrate the historical unreliability of the
Gospels and by extension, the non-historicity of the _Gospel_ Jesus. That’s
the Jesus modern Christians need to exist in order for them to assert that
their beliefs are true. These two claims are absolutely essential to
Christianity and no amount of pseudo-philosophical language can change that.
Some Christians may be, for instance, of the Van Tillian flavor and argue that
I need to either firmly establish my entire epistemology or debase their
epistemology in order to make my claims. They’re essentially moving the
goalposts and making Christianity as abstract as possible, so that it is
easier to sidestep the questions I’ve just answered.

The CMB is the residual radiation from the recombination epoch. Another red
herring. This has nothing to do with my post.

I brought it and made easy work of your “challenges.” Congratulations, you are
now prohibited from commenting on my blog. 🙂

If consensus is what ultimately matters, then here are plenty of facts
compliments of Wikipedia.

In any case, here’s a great article for you to consider. Apologists are lying
to you.

Of these references, two, three, seven (?) and eight relate to the figure in
the Bible. However, the other references do not relate to him in the
slightest; (1) doesn’t because it specifically says he had five disciples and
not the 12 mentioned in the Gospels, and (8) doesn’t relate to him because it
says that Mary slept with a soldier named Pantera–thus making Jesus his
bastard son rather than someone born of a virgin. Number seven speaks of a
Jesus who was stoned and then hanged. The Gospels do not corroborate the
stoning account in Sanhedrin 43. It is obvious that Christians are biased when
appealing to this source. Scholars are divided concerning the relationship
these references have to a historical Jesus. Moreover, they consider the
passages to be a response to Christian proselytism.

To demonstrate why the Gospels aren’t internally consistent, I need only
present a series of examples. No Christian to date has solved this conundrum
and that’s because they simply can’t. Bock’s harmonizing tactics don’t work
because in many of these cases, it makes for one heck of a confused narrative.

Um, where are you getting this figure from? The overwhelming majority of
biblical scholars and Jewish rabbis today openly concede the Pentateuch is
geopolitical myth, an origin dream devised by Judean priests (from Judah) to
capitalise on the weakened Kingdom of Israel after it’s sacking in 722 BCE. It
is not until about halfway through the Book of Kings when it actually becomes
a reliable historical source concerning the early Hebrews. Rabbi’s admit this,
KQ. Rabbi’s are quite open about this.

Short on facts and yet, some 50% of the writing is from outside sources. I
guess you didn’t read the post at all. You read the title and threw a tantrum.

The last sentence is another non sequitur. Jesus’ disciples were young,
certainly, and could easily have lived until the date at which the gospels
were written. I KNOW people in similiar situations who witness to events they
saw 70 years ago in their youths (World War II vets, etc) — plus Mark may have
been written rather earlier.

Carrier goes on to speak of Phelgon of Tralles. His analysis is interesting
and to my mind, thorough and conclusive. Anyone who’s interested can read his
full analysis which is cited below.

Right away, if we call to mind the content of the Gospels, we will quickly
notice that the Gospels meet none of these criteria. They don’t accurately
represent the past events in question. In fact, the Gospels embellish and
mythologize and thus, make it quite difficult to find the historical tidbits
contained within them. They also do not investigate these events or offer
plausible interpretations of what happened. More specifically, they don’t
explain how or why a given event happened. Ferguson continues:

Aside from this, since the original manuscripts aren’t available, we don’t
know whether these titles were original to the text. Bart Ehrman explains that
the titles can’t be traced back to the original manuscripts and that it is
highly likely that the titles were added afterward by scribes.7

You’re on my spam list, but I had to approve this comment. The irony is just
too good. 🙂

Pliny’s letter to Trajan provided details concerning the trials Pliny
conducted. Though the letter mentions Christ, the letter gives more insight on
the practices of early Christians and the attitudes Roman officials had toward
them. Like the previous sources, it doesn’t give us any information on a
historical Jesus nor the divinity of Jesus as described in the Gospels.

As stated earlier, we cannot have external attestation of Jesus walking on
water. According to the myth, it happened during a storm, so there’s no
conceivable way an ancient historian would have been out in the storm seeing
this all unfold. One might argue, however, that there is historical
attestation for the existence of Jesus. In this section, I simply want to
throw the external attestations into disarray. I, in other words, want
Christians to question Josephus, Tacitus, Suetonius, and so on. I want them to
realize that these external attestations aren’t as reliable as they’ve been
led to believe.

For starters, Christians who think that the miraculous acts found in the
Gospels are historical are confronted by an unfavorable fact: none of the
extra-biblical sources confirm _any_ of Jesus’ miracles. My purposes here
aren’t so much to show that they fail to mention any of his miraculous acts,
but that they might also fail to mention him altogether.

There are many patently false claims in this article. It is not true that “the
authors of historical accounts” always identify themselves — for instance, the
authors of the Analects, a very similar work to the gospels, do not. But
Bauckham argues that there are sufficient clues about the identities of two or
three evangelists.

In order to understand the conclusion made, it is useful to quote the passage
in question. Then you’ll see why some scholars have concluded that Tacitus is
relaying hearsay.

What they have done is compare the Gospels to written histories that are
contemporary and by contemporary, I mean written histories during the time of
the Gospels, before their time, and shortly after. Philo and Josephus are much
more rigorous.

3.So you agree with Darwin’s concern regarding morality?

Isn’t that what you’re doing by making stupid comments on blogs you don’t
like? If you don’t like the content, you can simply leave. Honestly, if you
don’t have anything intelligent to contribute in these comments, I’ll simply
stop approving them.

Given what’s outlined above, the authorship and genre of the Gospels are
dubious. In other words, we don’t know who the authors actually were.
Furthermore, despite Christian pretenses, they aren’t historical texts or
biographies. They are embellished hagiographies that are littered with myths.
There’s also no external attestation or corroboration of any of the more
fantastical elements in the Gospels; also, corroboration of the more grounded
elements are questionable. To top it all off, the Gospels do not cohere with
one another in a few key places. So aside from the fact that Jesus did not
walk on water, Jesus didn’t do anything the Gospels say he did. The Christian
must either a) provide warrant for their opinion; b) provide justification for
their opinion; or c) demonstrate that their opinion aligns most closely to the
facts or is a reiteration of some truth. In this case, their opinion is
untenable.

“Neither the evangelists nor their first readers engaged in historical
analysis. Their aim was to confirm Christian faith (Lk 1.4; Jn 20.31).
Scholars generally agree that the Gospels were written forty to sixty years
after the death of Jesus. They thus do not present eyewitness or contemporary
accounts of Jesus’ life and teachings.”

The reason Dawkins admits that is, once again, going over your head. Evolution
is a biological process. The emergence of DNA is a chemical process. Want to
learn about it, research tRNA, though I’m quite sure you won’t understand that
either.

Now, that the Gospels don’t discuss their sources is valid because, unlike the
Iliad, Christians are claiming that the Gospels record history; they say the
same of Acts. A lot of their contents are fantastical, so the corroborative
sources would have to attest to that. Yet they don’t. Philo, a contemporary of
Jesus, says nothing about him. Josephus says next to nothing. There were
historians, polemicists, poets, satirists and so on who were his
contemporaries and their silence is curious given what the Gospels say. We can
get into the fact that these Gospels are the proto-Orthodox favorites that
endured; there were many more gospels in the first century, a lot of which
stemmed from gnosticism. If the Gospel Jesus was historical, Christianity
would have been absolutely clearcut. Yet Paul talks about his opponents,
especially in Corinthians and Colossians; that speaks to how many different
versions we already had just a mere 20 years after his death. These are all
points that have their own scholarly underpinnings.

In addition, there is a great deal of evidence (Bauckham, Marshall) that the
gospels DO present eyewitness accounts.

Not a tantrum. An equal response to your assertion.  
Right off the beginning, you assert :  
“Are the Gospels historically reliable? The answer is a resounding no and this
much is admitted by the consensus:”

This would no doubt be of interest had it been written about closer to the
event. Unfortunately, the consensus is that Thallus wrote in the second
century. Richard Carrier states:

And even if Rabbis weren’t, archaeology does not corroborate the kingdoms of
David and Solomon. It doesn’t help us locate historical Patriarchs. It also
doesn’t corroborate the battle at Jericho, as accounted in the Bible. As
stated, only after Kings do we get anything of historical value.

“He has no form or comeliness;  
And when we see Him,  
There is no beauty that we should desire Him.

> Currently there is broad agreement among archaeologists and Bible scholars
> that there is no historical basis for the narratives of the Patriarchs, the
> Exodus from Egypt, and the conquest of Canaan, nor any archaeological
> evidence to make them think otherwise.

Are the Gospels historically reliable? The answer is a resounding no and this
much is admitted by the consensus:

“Confirming Christian faith” is also squishy. “The witnesses’ aim was to
confirm that he saw the accused murder the deceased” may be entirely true,
without in any way impugning his or her testimony. People often try to
convince others because they themselves have been convinced: that is not
inherently irrational or unholy.

Right. You read the opening sentence and threw a tantrum; big difference. I
opened with that because that’s the claim I was looking to substantiate and
given the scholarship in the post, I think I accomplished that. And you’re not
biased? Why else are you here commenting on an atheist’s page? In any case,
this isn’t about a bias. This is about a fair analysis. I know what your
apologists say; they’re not convincing. I know about Q (quella), the proposed
Aramaic gospel that Mark translated into Greek. Yet there’s no copy of Q and
it’s likely an authentic copy will never be found. Attempted reconstructions
are based on your favorite word, conjecture. People disagree with your
worldview; out of the two of us, you’re the only one that’s bothered by that.
I’ve not gone to your page and commented against anything, and believe me, I
could. I simply don’t feel the need to. My post isn’t about de-converting
Christians; it’s about opposing two common claims, claims that people make way
too often, and this without any attempts at substantiating them. I believe I
succeed at doing substantiating the counter claim. If you don’t think that,
show me why. Stop giving me these short, useless comments.

I have refuted quite a few claims by Ferguson and Carrier at
christthetao.blogspot.com, and will add more in my new book. It isn’t hard.
Nor, for that matter, is rebutting Ehrman, who is often remarkably sloppy when
he has a point to make. The normal response, to which I have become rather
accustomed from some quarters (I don’t mean from Ehrman), is a stream of
personal insults. But the facts are stubborn things.

And, while they were thus stoning him to death, one of the priests of the sons
of Rechab, the son of the Rechabites, to whom testimony is born by Jeremiah
the prophet, began to cry aloud, saying, “Stop! What are you doing!? The just
man is praying for us.” But one among them, one of the fullers, took the staff
with which he was accustomed to wring out the garments he dyed, and hurled it
at the head of the just man.

Aside from that, there is absolutely zero outside attestation of this event.
There can’t be any because this anonymous writer is telling a story that
conveniently took place in a storm. Therefore, no one could have seen it
happen and thus, there cannot be any extra-biblical attestation. There’s a
much more plausible explanation for this story and I’ll be sure to return to
this later, but as far as the historical reliability of this story, it is safe
to conclude it was dead on arrival. The notion that Jesus actually walked on
water is beyond laughable in any circle outside of one comprised of deluded
believers. Furthermore, there’s no research they will find to adequately
defend their view. They are, in other words, left with no warrant or
justification for holding said view. They are therefore left with no claim to
the truth or factuality of their claim, not just for the miracle in question,
but also for the other miracles mentioned in the Gospels.

No it doesn’t. To chase this red herring would be a mistake on my part. You’re
too misinformed to correct. I was making a point about scholarly consensus and
not necessarily about the Big Bang.

Stupid question. There is the total number of protein molecules per cell and
the number of different proteins in a cell. Your question makes no sense.
You’re just trying hard to make me believe you’re intelligent. Still a red
herring because it has absolutely nothing to do with my post.

You’re still not convinced because you’re an obstinate believer. It’s not that
the arguments aren’t good; it’s not that you can refute the scholarship cited;
it’s not that you can make a better case for the historical reliability of the
Gospels and the existence of the Gospel Jesus; it’s that you’ll reject
anything that counters your beliefs. I must be wrong because you’ve already
found the “truth.” You can’t find what you haven’t sought.

I’m sure Christians think the consensus says otherwise, since many of them
seem to have done nothing but indulge their confirmation bias and read what
conservative Christian scholars have had to say about this matter. Like the
evangelists and first readers, these scholars want to confirm the Christian
faith. They never intended to conduct honest research. For starters, had they
actually intended to conduct honest research, in starting from the assumption
that the Gospels are historically reliable, they would have quickly come to
find out that the Gospels are not historically reliable at all.

Lastly, you didn’t ask questions. You beat your chest and made assertions. You
claimed that the other guy “refuted” a 20+ page argument with a mere assertion
that basically said: the fact that an x can’t be shown to exist in relation to
y doesn’t mean that x doesn’t exist; in other words, that god can’t be shown
to exist in relation to the Earth doesn’t mean god doesn’t exist. Yet on
Judaism and Christianity, god created the Earth. Modern science tells us that
planets have no creator; they form naturally over an extended period of time.
The history of our planet doesn’t resemble anything mentioned in the Bible. By
extension, god doesn’t exist in relationship to the universe; he didn’t create
it. A whiff of modern cosmology can tell you that.

In any case, scholarly consensus is not like demographics. These demographics
you speak of are about non-belief; when scholars come to a consensus, they’re
agreeing on what constitutes knowledge rather than belief or lack thereof. The
consensus is that evolution is a well-supported theory in science; the same is
said of the Big Bang. The consensus is that the historical evidence for the
Gospel Jesus is severely lacking; in fact, it’s just not available at all.
Also, if your comment was intelligent, you would have been able to anticipate
my response, namely that Islam is the world’s fastest growing religion. So if
you really want to disingenuously conflate demographics with scholarly
consensus, you have to admit that what your belief isn’t true either. You’ve
mistaken consensus for an argument from popularity. They’re not the same
thing.

That blows a great big hole in the evolutionary process of origin of morality.

He also concludes that the passage was likely speaking of Jesus ben Damneus
and his brother James. Ananus ordered that James be stoned to death; Ananus
was soon replaced by Jesus ben Damneus–perhaps a punishment for killing an
innocent man. Josephus discusses this in the same narrative a few lines after
purportedly mentioning “James the Just” who was “the brother of Jesus who was
called the Christ.“ Therefore, it is highly probable that he originally spoke
of Jesus ben Damneus and his brother James. This is a well-supported
conclusion–especially when considering that the death by stoning of “James the
Just” is not corroborated anywhere else. Hegesippus wrote a myth concerning
the stoning of James; however, this myth is markedly different. In this myth,
James the Just is thrown from the roof of a temple and then stoned; however,
that doesn’t result in his death. He dies when he is struck in the head with a
staff.15 Also, there is no mention of Ananus, and that is perhaps the key
difference.

I guess you didn’t know that your “history” is church myth. Only non-
Christians use BCE? So I guess the professors that identify as Christians are
actually non-Christians in secret. Do yourself the favor of coming here to
learn rather than impose unsubstantiated belief. This isn’t your church. There
are a few informed people respectfully expressing historical and archaeology
facts. Saying “nuh uh, you’re trying to diminish Christ’s importance” is
simply closed-minded. If that’s how you are and you wish to remain that way,
stop commenting.

That the authors don’t tell us who they are is a glaring issue because the
authors of historical accounts identify themselves, e.g., Jospephus,
Suetonius. It’s an issue, but it can be overcome. Tacitus, for instance, did
_not_ identify himself. Thus, this need not be the deciding factor in
concluding that the Gospels are historically unreliable. The question remains,
however, how exactly does one identify the author of a historical text. Though
we’re not discussing external attestation and internal consistency just yet,
these points relate to how we find out who the author of such a text is. It is
widely recognized that there’s not one generally accepted method for doing
this, but there are reliable ways. Matthew Ferguson outlines one way in which
we identify the author of an ancient historical text:

And why would I think other histories are myth if they can be corroborated?
The Jewish origin tale has been known to be myth for nearly three generations
now. This is not new information. Did you know that in 1998, the American
Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR), the primary American professional body
for archaeologists working in the Middle East, changed the name of its
magazine from Biblical Archaeologist to Near Eastern Archaeology simply
because the bible had been determined to be (beyond all doubt) an entirely
unreliable historical source to direct research into the early Jews, pre-
Babylonian captivity.

The problem is the Christian’s starting point. Their claim is fixed and is
therefore the “truth claim.” They then try to find only that evidence which
seems to agree with their presumed conclusion. This is confirmation bias. This
is what I mean when I call someone intellectually dishonest. They do not
research first and then conclude. They draw a comforting conclusion and then
seek evidence; some don’t even care about evidence or change the meaning of
evidence so that it is easier for them to disqualify unfavorable facts. At any
rate, the authorship of the Gospels is a settled matter: the Gospels are
anonymous works and aside from the pretended expertise of layman and the books
of dishonest apologists like Lee Strobel, there’s no way around that.

I posted an essay a while back documenting a couple dozen obvious — repeat,
obvious! — falsehoods in his book about the new atheism, and Marshall
responded to some of those allegations by simply conjuring up even more
falsehoods, some of which were even more blatant than his original falsehood.
It’s like Marshall was *trying* to look dishonest.

There were no independent sources that predate the gospels that speak of Jesus
because they had to wait for Him to be born and rise form the dead first!

In any case, anyone willing to be honest would see that the story of Jesus
walking on water isn’t historical. It’s not based in fact nor is there any
evidence to support that claim. To the contrary, there is incontrovertible
evidence to support what I’ve offered here–even a charitable interpretation
available to Christians. That the story of Jesus walking on water was meant to
be considered an allegory in no way implies that they should renounce their
beliefs altogether; it in no way implies that Christianity is false. In fact,
there are plenty of Christians who favor this interpretation and have no issue
with its ahistorical content. Or perhaps, to their mind, it isn’t even an
attempt at historical retelling; it’s, in other words, non-historical since
the story wasn’t meant to be read that way.

3He is despised and rejected by men,  
A Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.  
And we hid, as it were, our faces from Him;  
He was despised, and we did not esteem Him.”  
(Isaiah 53, The Bible )

The pretentious fool could have commented under my Argument From Cosmology; he
didn’t. Perhaps he saw the breadth of my posts and realized that he’s in over
his head. In any case, that’s not a rebuttal; that’s mere disagreement with a
misreading of my conclusion. “I doubt you’re more advanced than me,” the
arrogant fool said. That’s why I blocked him too; I don’t deal with
pretentious undergrads who think they know it all. He doesn’t reach my toes in
philosophy and I just showed you that.

That last point speaks to the exact genre of the Gospels. As they stand, they
are mythological hagiographies. As a point of comparison, Ferguson goes on to
speak of Alexander the Great, since myths about him became ubiquitous shortly
after his death.

In order to prove Christianity true, two central claims are necessary: the
Gospel Jesus is a historical person and the Gospels are historically reliable.
These are two related claims and both are verifiable or falsifiable. What
follows demonstrates exactly why both claims are false.

And, when many were fully convinced by these words, and offered praise for the
testimony of James, and said, “Hosanna to the son of David,” then 30.
Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History 2.23.3–18 (SC 31:86–90; trans. NPNF2 1:207–8,
modified; my emphasis). again the Pharisees and scribes said to one another,
“We have not done well in procuring this testimony to Jesus. But let us go up
and throw him down, that they may be afraid, and not believe him.” And they
cried aloud, and said, “Oh! Oh! The just man himself is in error.” Thus they
fulfilled the Scripture written in Isaiah: “Let us away with the just man,
because he is troublesome to us: therefore shall they eat the fruit of their
doings.” So they went up and threw down the just man, and said to one another,
“Let us stone James the Just.” And they began to stone him, for he was not
killed by the fall; but he turned, and kneeled down, and said, “I beseech
Thee, Lord God our Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.”

Scholars generally consider this passage to be both authentic and historically
reliable. However, there are some issues with this source, namely that the
passage may have been hearsay. R.T. France states that Tacitus repeated what
he heard from Christians. More specifically, he stated:

1\. Jesus as a sorcerer with disciples (b Sanh 43a-b)  
2\. Healing in the name of Jesus (Hul 2:22f; AZ 2:22/12; y Shab 124:4/13; QohR
1:8; b AZ 27b)  
3\. As a torah teacher (b AZ 17a; Hul 2:24; QohR 1:8)  
4\. As a son or disciple that turned out badly (Sanh 193a/b; Ber 17b)  
5\. As a frivolous disciple who practiced magic and turned to idolatry (Sanh
107b; Sot 47a)  
6\. Jesus’ punishment in hell (b Git 56b, 57a)  
7\. Jesus’ execution (b Sanh 43a-b)  
8\. Jesus as the son of Mary (Shab 104b, Sanh 67a)

> Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and
> inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their
> abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the

> (Annals 15:44, c.a. 116 AD).16

Also, Tacitus would have known that Pilate was a prefect and not a procurator.
At best, the passage describes an event that involved early Christians and it
also establishes that a man known as Christus was crucified by Pilate. It
doesn’t establish that he resurrected. It doesn’t establish that he performed
miracles. It doesn’t establish that he walked on water. It doesn’t establish
that he ascended to the right hand of the father. It is not corroboration for
the _Gospel_ Jesus.

They came, therefore, in a body to James, and said, “We entreat you, restrain
the people: for they are gone astray in their opinions about Jesus, as if he
were the Christ. We entreat you to persuade all who have come here for the day
of the Passover, concerning Jesus. For we all listen to you; since we, as well
as all the people, bear you testimony that you are just, and show partiality
to none. Therefore, persuade the people not to entertain erroneous opinions
concerning Jesus: for all the people, and we also, listen to you. Take your
stand, then, upon the summit of the Temple, that from that elevated spot you
may be clearly seen, and your words may be plainly audible to all the people.
For, in order to attend the Passover, all the tribes have congregated here,
and some of the Gentiles also.”

Besides, Ben Stein has Dawkins admitting he thinks DNA information had to
originate from a source outside the evolutionary process.  
There is no model in nature for adding information, let alone 3.2 billion bits
of genetic information we find in each strand of human DNA.

For one, we have newspapers, news outlets, cameras to record events, written
transcripts, and so on. Historians tasked with writing about our times have
different methods and source materials. So there’s no way we can hold the
Gospels to today’s standards, and that’s not what these scholars have done.

To repeat that last line: “nor any archaeological evidence to make them think
otherwise.”

Also, keep in mind, I am not saying there wasn’t a historical Jesus, i.e., a
person on whom the Gospel figure was based on. What I am saying is that the
historical Jesus was not the Gospel Jesus, which is the same as saying that
Jesus–as depicted in the Gospels–is not a historical person. This isn’t a
strange argument because other than really conservative scholars and
apologists, no one can honestly make that claim after considering the sources
available. It is, however, a central claim in Christianity. To my mind, for
Christianity to be true, it is necessary that the Gospel Jesus be historical
and if you really want to get technical, it is necessary for the Jesus
featured in the Gospel of John to be historical. That technicality leads to
problems, not least of which being that the Gospel of John was written some
60-70 years after his death.

This is the arguably the primary reason they’re historically unreliable: they
don’t even qualify as historical accounts in the first place. If we cannot
establish that these are historical accounts, then we can’t even begin to talk
about whether they’re historically reliable. It stands to reason that they
have to be proven historical texts before we begin to have a conversation
about whether the text honors what actually took place and whether it
adequately explains and interprets these events. A Christian can claim, for
example, that Jesus walking on water is the “truth claim.” Yet this doesn’t
read as a historical account, much less a reliable one. We have an isolated
event that is told in a story-like manner in where the writer narrates his
account from an omniscient point of view. There is no investigation, no
explanation of why this happened, and no plausible interpretation for this
rare feat.

I didn’t expect you to reply. I expected you to use your heart, instead of
your head, and give yourself a break! Stop being so hard on yourself. There is
a God, He loves you and, unlike nothingness, He makes people VERY happy. Join
the fun! You have NOTHING to loose but your pain and self-doubt. Trust me,
whether or not you want to believe it (or, more likely, whether you’ve been
told otherwise) you ARE worthy of being created by an Almighty God who
literally loves you. Just open your HEART to His love and you’ll be happy too!
It’s that simple. God bless and good luck.

We all know you have a hard on for Matthew Ferguson. I’ve spoken to you before
and don’t enjoy it. In your delusions, you might think it’s because you’re so
intelligent and informed; you’re not. Loftus and Ferguson have dealt with you
rather handily. I’ll leave it to my readers to go check out your blog and
theirs to see what I’m talking about. I’m not going to be another atheist you
add to your list to stalk and smear. This will be the only comment I approve.
The rest of your comments will be trashed without consideration. Go whine
about it on your blog the way you always do. 🙂

To your first question, we can’t. However, the scholars I cited are not
holding them to today’s standards. In fact, today’s standards are different,
far and wide. Let’s consider why.

One thing at a time.  
Okay?  
The Big Bang acctually supports the Biblical claim that God created
everything.  
You know about fine tuning, right?

“Studies on the demographics of atheism have concluded that self-identified
atheistscomprise anywhere from 2% to 13% of the world’s population, whereas
people without a religion (atheism isn’t a religion) comprise anywhere from
10% to 22% of the world’s population.[1][2][3][4] Several polls have been
conducted by Gallup International: in their 2012 poll of 57 countries, 13% of
respondents were “convinced atheists” and in their 2015 poll of 65 countries
11% were “convinced atheists”.[4][5] In Scandinavia, the Netherlandsand East
Asia, and particularly in China, atheists and the nonreligious are the
majority.[5] Of the global atheist and nonreligious population, 76% reside in
Asia and the Pacific, while the remainder reside in Europe (12%), North
America (5%), Latin America and the Caribbean (4%), sub-Saharan Africa (2%)
and the Middle East and North Africa (less than 1%).[3] In Africa and South
America, atheists are typically in the single digits.[5] According to Pew
Research Center’s 2012 global study of 230 countries and territories, 16% of
the world’s population is not affiliated with a religion, while 84% are
affiliated.[6] Furthermore, the global study noted that many of the
unaffiliated, which include atheists and agnostics, still have various
religious beliefs and practices.[3]”

Part of the reason Carrier doesn’t cite it in his own paper is because
Carrier’s conclusion is markedly different from Goldberg’s. Carrier’s
conclusion addresses James the brother of Jesus. The James passage isn’t
“almost universally” acknowledged as authentic as some have claimed, and that
has never been the case; more importantly, because of Carrier’s paper that
will never be the case. So what is Carrier’s conclusion?

The very first time I was the use of BCE was 25 years ago in a museum in
Israel. This is were it began and the motivation for its use is self-evident.
Anti-Christian fervor.

Ah the persecution complex. Newsflash, not everyone is against you. The rest
of your comment is an unqualified opinion–so unqualified that it doesn’t even
merit refutation. Like Christ Centered Teaching, if you have nothing
intelligent or relevant to add to the comment section, I reserve the right to
prohibit you from commenting. I’ve been respectful enough to let you and CCT
voice your opinions, regardless of how irrelevant and, frankly speaking,
stupid they are. I am under no obligation to do that. Set aside the
persecution complex and learn. Then again, you’re anti-academic. That explains
a lot!

The following is Roman historian Suetonius’ reference: “Claudius Judaeos
impulsore Chresto assidue tumultuantes Roma expulit (Life of Claudius, 110
CE).” The translation is: “Claudius drove the Jews out of Rome, who at the
suggestion of Chrestus were constantly rioting.” The reference doesn’t say
Christus. It clearly says Chrestus. However, Jesus could not have been alive
at this time because Claudius reigned from the years 41-54. Christians believe
that Christ was crucified in the year 33 C.E. Thus, if he existed, he was not
alive at this time and therefore, the passage isn’t referring to the Gospel
Jesus or the individual he was based on. Like the previous three, it does
nothing to establish his divinity.

Persecution complex? I don’t think so. So when pressed, you shut down the
debate? That just proves my point. Indefensible opinion is your area of
expertise, not mine. Ta ta.

This is a false dichotomy. “Historical analysis” is not the same as
“historically true writing about the past,” which the evangelists DID aim at.
They were not academic historians, but that does not mean they were freely
making stuff up, either. Ferguson makes a big deal about tendatious
differences between the genre of history and the genre of gospel out of
intellectual confusion.

And so he suffered martyrdom; and they buried him on the spot, and the pillar
erected to his memory still remains, close by the temple. This man was a true
witness to both Jews and Greeks that Jesus is the Christ. And immediately
Vespasian besieged them.

As stated earlier, I said I would return to the story of Jesus walking on
water. Despite what some modern Christians think, it can be argued that this
was never meant to be taken literally. Likewise, this story may have been
written as allegory.

In fact, this sort of figurative talk for so called trials and tribulations is
alive and well in the modern day. Christians still talk about deserts and
storms when speaking of their problems or tests of faith. In fact, the story
of Jesus walking on water is often used in one sermon after another in
relation to the struggles one is currently facing. The disciples represent the
Christian. They are, in other words, alone and helpless. Though they have each
other’s company, none of them can stop what comes next. The congregation can’t
exactly help the Christian out of their current jam. But along comes Christ as
a phantom on the stormy sea; he has come to rescue them and get them out of
the jam. I can’t for the life of me see how anyone would come to read this
story literally and consider it a piece of historical retelling.

We’ll begin by discussing the _[Testimonium
Flavianum](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.earlychristianwritings.com%2Ftestimonium.html&t=MzcxODAyNDFlYmU2MjhiYjM4Mjg1N2YyNGVjNGRkZDkzNGVkMWI3OCxqVzJWUmJzSA%3D%3D)._
There isn’t much debate about it’s authenticity. Christian apologists will
have us believe that, but there have been a few nails in this coffin for quite
some time. Richard Carrier put the last nail in the coffin with his paper,
_Origen, Eusebius, and the Accidental Interpolation in Josephus_. Before we go
there, allow me to quote Carrier who speaks of another important paper that
Christians will likely never read:

Consensus? That’s your justification for calling 5000 years of recorded
history a lie? The better question is, “Were you there?” If not, you have less
historical documentation from which to make your assumptions about Christ’s
life than the average local minister. You have absolutely nothing to prove you
are correct other than the writings of modern day cynics, unbelievers,
skeptics and other assorted disgruntled humans. This is hardly the kind of
“proof” that any reasonable person could use and still come to your
conclusions. And certainly their writings are nothing of value to anyone who
is seriously seeking the truth because most begin with personal assumptions
based on their own “feelings” versus the eyewitness accounts of the 12 men who
lived with Jesus, 11 of whom were viciously martyred, rather than deny their
faith in Christ as the Son of God. You are in no position to have any opinion
on these matters as you are even farther down the food chain than those you so
blithely quote. God is good. That’s all you need to know. Now go and have a
wonderful day because God loves you too.

If you are who I think you are, I blocked you because you’re snarky and there

powerless to respond to them; Christians have a long history of silencing
their opponents. I’m just glad they can no longer put me to death. Silence me

Did Jesus carry the cross the entire way or did Simon of Cyrene carry it for
him; _Mark 15:21_ or _Luke 23:26_ and _John 19:17_? Did one robber mock him or
did both; _Matthew 27:44_ or _Luke 23:39-40_? Did the curtain rip before or

Magdalene go alone or did she have company and if so, how much company; _Mark
16:1-3_ (Mary Magdalene goes with Mary and Salome) or _Matthew 28:1_ (Mary
Magdalene goes with just Mary) or _John 20:1_ (she goes alone)? Was there one
man or one angel in the tomb ( _Mark 16:5_ or _Matthew 28:2-3_ ) or were there
two men or two angels ( _Luke 24:4_ or _John 20:11-12_ )? Was the stone rolled
away or not; _Mark 16:3-4_ or _Matthew 28:2_? Where’s this earthquake in the
other Gospels by the way? Were the disciples to stay in Jerusalem or were they
to go to Galilee ( _Mark 16:7_ and _Matthew 28:7_ or the silence of Luke and
John on whether or not to go to Galilee)? Did the women tell the disciples or
did they stay silent? As Ehrman says, it depends which Gospel you read.

Yes. It’s a proven fraud. This is a red herring and has nothing to do with my
post. The only people who think the Shroud is authentic are Catholics.
Protestants, Lutherans, and Orthodox Christians don’t give a donkey’s behind
about the shroud. Facts hurt, I know.

The fact remains that there’s no external attestation. Pliny, for instance,
confirms that Tacitus wrote _Historae_. No one confirms that Mark, for
instance, wrote the Gospel of Mark. A lot more can be said on this topic and
since I do not consider myself an authority on this topic, I’d advise
Christians to read Ferguson’s “Why Scholars Doubt the Traditional Authors of

That’s another reason I blocked you: you are utterly incapable of
understanding my arguments and so you depended on a pretentious undergrad who
thought he did. His assertion is not enough to refute my argument. In fact,
all he’s concluding is the opposite of what he misunderstood as my conclusion.
My actual conclusion is this: x does not exist in relation to y iff it is
necessary that x exist in relation to y. If god did not create the Earth or
the universe, he doesn’t exist in relation to either, and by extension,
doesn’t exist; however, on Christianity, it is *necessary* that he does. Or is
he not a necessary being on your view?

You know a writer in trouble when he starts off with Matthew Ferguson:

Though there is a clear issue in identifying biographies in the Greco-Roman
period, as with the criteria of historical texts, the Gospels also fail to
match the criteria of historical biography in that period. The reasoning here
is quite involved and once again, I’d advise Christians to read Ferguson’s
“Are the Gospels Biographies?: The Spectrum of Ancient Βίοι,” which is cited
below. For our purposes though, it is useful to note Ferguson’s observations
concerning the type of biographies the Gospels attempt to be–namely ones that
focus on Jesus’ moral character and personality:

I once brought my friend’s mom to church. She was touched and went up for
prayer. My ex pastor “prophesied” and said that god would deliver her from
drug addiction. Unfortunately, she never touched a drug in her life! She was
never an addict. She was *not* on a destructive path. She was so upset; she
never came back. Charismatic Pentecostal churches are more like cults; there
were plenty of Christians voicing their disagreement with that post.

As stated earlier, unless you’re a conservative New Testament scholar, this is
straightforwardly accepted. Of course, this isn’t widely accepted by
Christians, but that’s because this information isn’t as accessible as
misinformation. Apologetic works like Strobel’s “The Case For Christ” are much
more available. Furthermore, this sort of information isn’t openly discussed
in church or even in seminaries. Some seminaries will brainwash Christians
into thinking all of this is irrelevant. Unfortunately, it isn’t–most
especially when they’re trying to argue that the Gospels relay historical
events. The Gospels do not speak of a historical account.

15 Now some persons belonging to the seven [Jewish] sects existing among the
people, which have been before described by me in the Commentaries, asked
James: “What is the door of Jesus? And he replied that he was the Savior. In
consequence of this answer, some believed that Jesus is the Christ. But the
sects before mentioned did not believe, either in a resurrection or in the
coming of one to requite every man according to his works; but those who did
believe, believed because of James. So, when many even of the ruling class
believed, there was a commotion among the Jews, and scribes, and Pharisees,
who said, “A little more, and we shall have all the people looking for Jesus
as the Christ.”

As with Tacitus, even if the author doesn’t identify himself within the text,
there are other ways we can know who wrote the text. One way is to place one’s
name in the genitive, as Tacitus did. This isn’t to say that the name in the
genitive correctly attributes a work to said author in every case. This can
still be doubted. The Gospels, on the other hand, fail in this regards.
Ferguson states:

7 Ehrman, Bart D. _Jesus, Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium_. Oxford:
Oxford UP, 1999. 249-250. Print.

The Gospels operated, at least originally, more as “open texts,” since much of
their content was adapted and reworked into later versions. For example, the
Gospel of Matthew borrows from as much as 80% of the verses in Mark, and Luke
likewise borrows from 65% of the material in Mark. This is not typical of
historical and scholarly biographies, which had greater authorial control,
such as those of Plutarch, who does not merely copy his material from earlier
works.

Which Caesar? You don’t specify and you expect me to think of you as informed?

Conjecture. Short on facts means you will be long on conjecture in an attempt
to prove a point.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy the essay. Once you read it, you’ll think twice
before ever trusting him again.

By the way, I read your post, word for word. It contains a number of egregious
errors. Your “errors” are nothing but wishful thinking. I guess I’ll get
around to responding to the tripe this weekend.

[The Gospels are anonymous in the
composition](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fadversusapologetica.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F12%2F17%2Fwhy-

just like the popular biographies of Homer, Aesop, and Alexander.

We have more historical evidence in the way of ancient manuscripts to support
the Jesus lived died and rose from the grave then we have to support the fact
that Caesar lived.

When concerning the genre of the Gospels, it is not straightforwardly obvious
to Christians that they are not historical accounts. Christians with more
literalist bents can’t see it any other way. This goes back to starting with a
comforting conclusion. The conclusion is that Jesus was god and that
therefore, the acts attributed to him in the Gospels actually happened.
Otherwise, it would be difficult to conclude that he was god incarnate. Take
away all of these fantastical acts and all you have is an itinerant first
century preacher. This is precisely who the historical Jesus was according to
the majority of scholars. They have, in other words, favored a minimal
historicist conclusion. They have, for all intents and purposes, stripped
Jesus of the divinity he demonstrated in the stories told by the Gospels. In
any case, the Gospels aren’t historical accounts. Matthew Ferguson outlines
the criteria historical texts meet:

> The mainstream scholarly view is that the Gospels are anonymous works,
> written in a different language than that of Jesus, in distant lands, after
> a substantial gap of time, by unknown persons, compiling, redacting, and
> inventing various traditions in order to provide a narrative of
> Christianity’s central figure, Jesus Christ, to confirm the faith of their
> communities.3

Atheist here. I wonder, can we claim something is not historical because
author does not write historically by today’s standards? The Iliad is written
completely in verse and does not criticise history. These two developments are
concreted in Western historiography by of Ranke and Hegel. So is the critic
such as, ‘The Gospels do not discuss their sources or methodology’ valid?

“Neither the evangelists nor their first readers engaged in historical
analysis.”  
I think my analysis matched your the arrogance of such an outrageous
assertion.  
You obviously are extremely biased.  
Later

Stop the preaching. Been there, done that. Christianity is false. Your preachy
nonsense doesn’t work on me. I don’t think with my heart; no one does. I’m
happy and confident and perhaps to a degree greater than you are. Don’t assume
things about me because I don’t believe as you do. It’s condescending. Keep
that up and I’ll be sure to delete every comment you submit. You may not see
it as such, but assuming that much is disrespectful.

Just so you know, the **_only_** area where there is still a live debate
regarding biblical archaeology is whether or not Judah had an urban society in
the 9th Century BCE, which relates to the narrative concerning the United
Kingdom. That’s it. That’s all there is. The Patriarchs, Egypt, Moses, Exodus
and Conquest are **dead subjects** in the field of **serious** archaeology.
They were dismissed as myth decades ago, and nothing has changed in that time
to alter this consensus. As Israel’s oldest daily Newspaper, Hareetz,
announced recently:

Good Lord! How hopeless and depressing your baseless, non-Chistian beliefs
are! Changing the name of a society means nothing more than it was overrun by
non-believers, just as has been the case during the last 50 years, with most
“academic” organizations. They are now nothing more than shams. Their
“consensus” only proves that they have an anti-Christian agenda, and nothing
more.

Even conservative scholars like Craig Blomberg accept this conclusion, so if
you’re the type of Christian to bypass that and say the Gospels were written
by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, you might as well continue in your
delusions. The related delusion is that these accounts were written by
eyewitnesses. It is also a matter of consensus that the Gospels were not
written by eyewitnesses. Bart Ehrman puts it succinctly:

Sure, I went a step further: I stated that Christianity isn’t true. When you
consider that there’s no historical evidence for the Jesus in the Gospels and
more importantly, his resurrection and ascension, the conclusion is
inescapable. From the Apostle’s Creed to the Nicene Creed, the common
denominators are the historicity of the Gospel Jesus (not just any Jesus), his
resurrection, and his ascension to the right hand of the father. These are
simply beliefs and not historical facts, which is a glaring problem for your
religion whether you admit it or not.

Darwin was wrong about a lot of things. Darwin wasn’t infallible. Evolution
has developed as a theory since his day. Darwin also wasn’t an ethicist. I
would not look to him for advice about morality. But while we’re at it, people
have argued that morality can be explained in terms of evolution. See Frans de
Waal. Another red herring. This, once again, has nothing to do with my post.

I find it laughable that you think I should respond to this condescension. You
obviously didn’t read what I wrote because you’re still assuming the writers
of the Gospels were eyewitnesses. And you’re assuming skeptics and atheists
are disgruntled humans, and that I’m further down the food chain. So you’re
insulting me right off the bat. Now go have a great day because there’s no god
to love you. He doesn’t exist.

This is more or less the smoking gun. If we have either of these, but
preferably both, we have no reason to doubt the authorship of the text. To go
with an example you’re no doubt familiar with, no one can reasonably doubt the
authorship of the authentic Pauline Epistles: 1 and 2 Corinthians , Galatians,
Philemon, Philippians, Romans, and 1 Thessalonians. This can’t be reasonably
doubted because Paul identifies himself within the text. Yet the ones that are
doubted– Ephesians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians, Hebrews, 1 and 2 Timothy, and
Titus–are doubted for one of the reasons cited above. The non-authentic
Pauline Epistles are written in a palpably different style that doesn’t match
the style of the authentic ones. That there are only seven authentic Pauline
Epistles is a matter of scholarly consensus as well. Ephesians was and still
is disputed, but it is likelier that Ephesians is not authentic.

Your question is loaded. I can, like others have, write an essay about why
evil exists. I can talk about small amygdalae in vicious criminals, child
abuse, economic pressures, etc. It goes far beyond people “choosing” to do
evil. So by extension, if I felt you were capable of actually listening to me,
I would debase the Libertarian free will you’re depending on to make your
case. And Christianity isn’t a forced religion? Do Christians not prey on the
vulnerable? Are you not mandated to spread the Gospel? Worst infraction of
all, do you not brainwash children–i.e., teach them *what* to think rather
than *how* to think? As for your last sentence, that’s a straw man. You’re
assuming I agree with that line of thinking. I don’t.

Same claim you made yesterday. Congrats, you’re not prohibited from
commenting. You did it to yourself. Your idiocy knows no bounds.

No. You only have a setting of writings written 30-90 years after the alleged
events. Everything else written is based upon that. King Herod died 10 years
before the census. Both events are documented. The gospels are written
“according to” this means whoever wrote it down is disowning authorship. Do
other independent sources that predate the “gospels” speak of jesus or his
teachings?

Of course, there are many other sources according to apologetic sites, but
like the above, which are the most commonly cited, they are all problematic.
More importantly, none of them establish Jesus’ divinity; none of them attest
to his miracles and fantastical acts.

Excellent piece of writing. And don’t worry about CCT. He/She is well-known
across fundy and atheist blogs alike, is a laugh a minute and although not a
very scholarly term the epithet: Giant Arse-Hat comes to mind.

Still not convinced. By you blocking me on Instagram I feel satisfied you are
so inadequate to respond in a professional and factual manner that you decided
to block me instead. The HONY not allowing you to comment was probably fake as
well. But it’s okay I understand when someone is extremely egotistical it can
be hard to feel at a loss for words for simple questions.

That’s ridiculous! Under that guise, you could declare that ALL written
history was a geographical myth or a figment of someone’s imagination. Sorry,
that doesn’t fly! FYI. The Sumerians of Mesopotamia, which included Jews, were
first to emerge in recorded history in 3500 BC (BTW, only non-Christians use
BCE. It’s use is just another pathetic, transparent, and disingenuous ploy, by
unbelievers, to diminish Christ’s importance as the central figure to all of
human history), was 5000 years ago. I guess you didn’t know that.

The aforesaid scribes and Pharisees accordingly set James on the summit of the

to obey, forasmuch as the people are in error, and follow Jesus the crucified,
do tell us what is the door of Jesus, the crucified.” And he answered with a

No wonder your comments are so short because you actually have no points to
make. You just want to make believe you’re doing the work of the lord by
defending your faith. Try harder.

We have numerous images of Julius Cesar, including stamped coins. Do we have a
single image (or even physical description) of Jesus?

which is a feature of more historical and scholarly biographies. Instead, like
the popular biographies of Homer, Aesop, and Alexander the Great, they are
less critical, more hagiographical, and include more legends and myth-
making.10

To find out why this is the case, we need to discuss authorship, genre,
external attestation, and internal consistency. If we want to find out whether
we have a historically reliable piece of ancient writing, authorship is
important. The Gospels are a curious case already because unlike the writings
of ancient historians, the Gospels are, strictly speaking, anonymous.2 In the
same vein, the genre of the Gospels has to be called into question because
they’re not written as history. Furthermore, it doesn’t seem they were written
as biographies. Even if we allow the assumptions that they were ancient
biographies and are historically reliable, we’d still require external
attestation–especially for the more fantastical bits found in the Gospels,
e.g., Jesus walking on water. Also, if we allow for these assumptions, we’d
want to see if the Gospels are internally consistent, i.e., do the Gospels
cohere with one another. Once we discuss these points, we’ll arrive at the
honest conclusion that the Gospels are historically unreliable.

K.Q., you didn’t challenge anything about my post. You made one assertion
after another, and all of them were thoroughly dealt with. Upon dealing with
them, you proceeded to throw a tantrum. This isn’t a debate, since a debate
implies two or more participants that a) are willing to listen to one another
b) are knowledgeable about the topic at hand. You’ve failed in both respects.
The post isn’t my area of expertise, but the experts are cited in the post;
you’ve dealt with absolutely none of what they said. The only untenable
opinions here are yours.

Of course, Leon is correct in his assessment. Why not Ahura Mazda, his
hypostatic union to Spenta Mainyu, and his extension via the Amesha Spentas?
If, for instance, the one-many problem requires the notion of a One that is
also many, what exactly rules out Ahura Mazda? One starts to see how the
prevailing version of Theism in philosophy of religion is just a sad force of
habit. This is why it is necessary to move on from these arguments.
Contingency arguments are notoriously outmoded because Mackie, Le Poidevin,
and others have already provided general defeaters that can apply to any
particular contingency argument. Also, how many contingency arguments do we
need exactly? In other words, how many different ways can one continue to
assert that all contingent things require at least one necessary explanation?

To reinforce my point, I am going to quote Mackie and Le Poidevin’s
refutations of contingency arguments like Rasmussen’s. It should then become
clear that we have to bury these kinds of arguments for good. Let them who are
attached to these arguments mourn their loss, but I will attend no such wake.
What remains of the body is an ancient skeleton, long dead. It is high time to
give it a rest. Le Poidevin put one nail in the coffin of contingency
arguments. Anyone offering new contingency arguments has simply failed to do
their homework. It is typical of Christian Theists to indulge confirmation
bias and avoid what their opponents have to say. The problem with that is that
the case against contingency arguments has been made. Obstinacy does not
change the fact. Le Poidevin clearly shows why necessary facts do not explain
contingent ones:

This is a way of substantiating that an effect is inhered in a cause or the
principle, like effects from like causes. This has been precisely my criticism
of the idea that a nonphysical cause created the physical universe. There is
no theory of causation that permits the interaction of an ethereal entity’s
dispositions and that of physical things. It is essentially a paraphrase of
Elizabeth of Bohemia’s rebuttal to Cartesian dualism: how does mental
substance interact with physical substance? This is why mind-body dualism
remains in a state of incoherence, but I digress. Mackie puts yet another nail
in the coffin:

  1. April 17, 2021 - 11:37 pm Pingback: [Skeptical Theism and New Arguments For Atheism | The Philosophy Corner](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/04/17/skeptical-theism-and-new-arguments-for-atheism/)

Every contingency argument fails because it relies on the principle of
sufficient reason and because necessity does not cohere with contingency as it
concerns a so-called causal relation. Mackie, like Le Poidevin, also questions
why God is a satisfactory termination of the regress. Why not something
something else? (Ibid., 92). Contingency arguments amount to vicious special
pleading and an outright refusal to entertain viable alternatives, even in
cases where the alternatives are nonphysical and compatible with religious
sentiments. In any case, it would appear that the principle of sufficient
reason is not on stable ground. Neither is the notion that a necessary being
is the ultimate explanation of the universe. Contingency arguments have been
defeated and there really is no way to repeat these arguments in a way that
does not fall on the horns of Le Poidevin and Mackie’s defeaters. Only the
obdurate need to believe that God is the foundational explanation of the
universe explains the redundancy of Christian Theists within the philosophy of
religion. That is setting aside that apologetics is not philosophy and other
complaints I have had. The Geometric Argument, despite using different
language, _just is_ a contingency argument. If the dead horse could speak, it
would tell them all to lay down their batons once and for all, but alas.

Like Leon, I take issue with JR2. Leon does not really elaborate on why JR2 is
questionable saying only that “the most basic entities with geometry (if such
there be) have their geometrics of factual or metaphysical necessity” and that
therefore, “it’s not true that every geometric state is dependent” (Ibid.,
67). He is correct, of course, but elaboration could have helped here because
this is a potential defeater. Factual and metaphysical necessity are inhered
in physical necessity. The universe is such that the fact that every triangle
containing a 90-degree angle is a right triangle is reducible to physical
constraints within our universe. This fact of geometry is unlike Rasmussen’s
examples, namely chair and iPhone shapes. He states: “The instantiation of [a
chair’s shape] depends upon prior conditions. Chair shapes never instantiate
_on their own_ , without any prior conditions. Instead, chair-instantiations
depend on something” (Ibid., 41). This overt Platonism is questionable in and
of itself, but Leon’s statement is forceful in this case: the shape of the
chair is not dependent because it has its shape of factual or metaphysical
necessity that stem from physical necessity. Chairs, first and foremost, are
shaped the way they are because of our shape when we sit down; furthermore,
chairs take the shapes they do because of physical constraints like human
weight, gravity, friction against a floor, etc. For a chair not to collapse
under the force of gravity and the weight of an individual, it has to be
engineered in some way to withstand these forces acting on it; the chair’s
shape is so because of physical necessity and this explains its metaphysical
necessity. There is therefore, no _form_ of a chair in some ethereal realm; an
idea like this is thoroughly retrograde and not worth considering.

Setting aside that Rasmussen does not make clear why he prefers a Christian
view of ultimacy as opposed to a Zoroastrian one or another one that may be
proposed, I think Wildman is being quite generous when saying that
“alternative metaphysical schemes fit the empirical facts just as well as the
preferred metaphysical scheme” because the fact of the matter is that some
alternatives fit the empirical facts _better than_ metaphysical schemes like
the ones Christian Theists resort to. Rasmussen’s preferred metaphysical
scheme of a maximal foundation, which properly stated, is a disembodied,
nonphysical mind who is omnipresent, wholly good, and so on rests on dubious
assumptions that have not been made to cohere with the empirical facts.
Nonphysicalism, as I have shown in the past, does not even attempt to explain
brain-related phenomena. Physicalist theories have trounced the opposition in
that department and it is not even close. What is more is that Christian
Theists are especially notorious for not comparing their account to other
accounts and that is because they are not doing philosophy, but rather
apologetics. This is precisely why philosophy of religion _must_ move on from
Christian Theism. We can think of an intellectual corollary to forgiveness. In
light of Christian Theism’s abject failure to prove God, how many more chances
are we required to give this view? Philosophy of religion is, then, like an
abused lover continuing to be moved by scraps of affection made to cover up
heaps of trauma. The field should be past the point of forgiveness and giving
Christian Theism yet another go to get things right; it has had literal
centuries to get its story straight and present compelling arguments and yet
here we are retreading ground that has been walked over again and again and
again.

My purpose here is twofold: first and foremost, I want to clarify Rasmussen’s
argument because though I can understand why word of mouth can lead to what is
essentially a straw man of his argument, especially in light of the fact that
his argument requires one to pay for an online article or his book _Is God the
Best Explanation of Things?_ which he coauthored with Felipe Leon, it is
simply good practice to present an argument fairly. Secondly, I want to be
stern about the fact that philosophy of religion cannot continue to rake these
dead coals. Rasmussen’s argument is just another in a long, winding, and quite
frankly, tired history of contingency arguments. In in any case, the following
is the straw man I want my readers and anyone else who finds this post to stop
citing. This is decidedly _not_ Rasmussen’s argument:

In any case, the real issue is that chair and iPhone shapes are not the sort
of shapes that occur naturally in the universe. Those shapes, namely spheres,
ellipses, triangles, and so on, also emerge from physical necessity. It is
simply the case that a suspender on a bridge forms the hypothenuse of a right
triangle. Like a chair, bridge suspenders take this shape because of physical
necessity. The same applies to the ubiquity of spherical and elliptical shapes
in the universe. To further disabuse anyone of Platonic ideas, globular shapes
are also quite ubiquitous in the universe and are more prominent the closer we
get to the Big Bang. There are shapes inherent in our universe that cannot be
neatly called _geometrical_ and even still, these shapes are physically and
therefore, metaphysically necessitated. If JR2 is unsound, then the argument
falls apart. On another front, this addresses Rasmussen’s assertion that God
explains why there is less chaos in our universe. Setting aside that the
qualification of this statement is entirely relative, the relative order we
see in the universe is entirely probabilistic, especially given that entropy
guarantees a trend toward disorder as the universe grows older and colder.

Like Leon, I share his general concern about “any argument that moves from
facts about apparent contingent particularity and an explicability principle
to conclusions about the nature of fundamental reality” (Ibid., 67) or as I
have been known to put it: one cannot draw ontological conclusions on the
basis of logical considerations. Theistic philosophers of religion and
unfortunately, philosophers in general, have a terrible habit of leaping from
conceivability to possibility and then, all the way to actuality. Leon
elaborates:

Rasmussen has _no_ argument called The Argument From Arbitrary Limits.
Arbitrary limits actually feature in Leon’s chapter in where he expresses
skepticism of Rasmussen’s Geometric Argument (Rasmussen Joshua and Leon,
Felipe. _Is God The Best Explanation For Things_. Switzerland: Palgrave
Macmillan. 53-68. Print.). Also, Rasmussen has a Theistic conception of God
(omnipresent, wholly good, etc.) that is analogous to what Plantinga means by
maximal greatness, but Rasmussen does not refer to God using that term.
Perhaps there is confusion with his use of the word _maximal_ _conceivabl_
_e_. While given Rasmussen’s beliefs, he implies God with what he calls a
maximal foundation, “a foundation _complete_ with respect to its fundamental
(basic, uncaused) features” (Ibid., 140). He makes it clear throughout the
book that he is open to such a foundation that is not synonymous with God. In
any case, his _maximal conceivable_ is _not_ a being possessing maximal
greatness; at least, not exactly, since it appears he means something more
elementary given his descriptions of basic and uncaused, as these clearly do
not refer to omnipresence, perfect goodness, and so on. There may also be some
confusion with his later argument, which he calls “The Maximal Mind Argument”
(Ibid. 112-113), which fails because it is relies heavily on nonphysicalism, a
series of negative theories in philosophy of mind that do not come close to
offering alternative explanations for an array of phenomena thoroughly
explained by physicalism (see
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/)). In any case, Rasmussen has
no argument resembling the graphic above. His arguments rest on a number of
dubious assumptions, the nexus of which is his Geometric Argument:

> Necessary facts, then, cannot explain contingent ones, and causal
> explanation, of any phenomenon, must link contingent facts. That is, both
> cause and effect must be contingent. Why is this? Because causes make a
> difference to their environment: they result in something that would not
> have happened if the cause had not been present. To say, for example, that
> the presence of a catalyst in a certain set of circumstances speeded up a
> reaction is to say that, had the catalyst not been present in those
> circumstances, the reaction would have proceeded at a slower rate. In
> general, if A caused B, then, if A had not occurred in the circumstances, B
> would not have occurred either. (A variant of this principle is that, if A
> caused B, then if A had not occurred in the circumstances, the probability
> of B’s occurrence would have been appreciably less than it was. It does not
> matter for our argument whether we accept the origin principle or this
> variant.) To make sense of this statement, ‘If A had not occurred in the
> circumstances, B would not have occurred’, we have to countenance the
> possibility of A’s not occurring and the possibility of B’s not occurring.
> If these are genuine possibilities, then both A and B are contingent. So one

Ultimately, contingency arguments are yet another example of how repetitive
Christianized philosophy of religion has become. There is a sense in which
Leon, Le Poidevin, and Mackie are paraphrasing one another because, and here
is a bit of irony, like arguments result in like rebuttals. They cannot help
but to sound like they each decided or even conspired to write on the same
topic for a final paper. They are, after all, addressing the same argument no
matter how many attempts have been made to word it differently. It is a
vicious cycle, a large wheel that cannot keep on turning. It must be stopped
in its tracks if progress in the philosophy of religion is to get any real
traction.

4\. The person falling in notices _no difference_ in how time passes or how
light appears to them. They would continue to fall in to the black hole and
cross the event horizon as though nothing happened. ([“Falling Into a Black
Hole Sucks!”](https://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/11/20/falling-
into-a-black-hole-suck). _ScienceBlogs_. 20 Nov 2009. Web.)

The Temporal Parts Theory of Identity (hereon TPT) is derived from the notion
of time being, in some sense or to some degree, like space. One can think of,
for instance, a linear timeline depicting the years all 46 U.S. Presidents
held office. Or one can think of the x-y axis used in physics. Time is
represented by the x-axis whilst space is represented by the y. Or one can
think of a space-time diagram containing two axes representing space and
another to represent time. These sorts of considerations have led some
philosophers and scientists to ask whether time is a dimension. According to
some accounts, time is the fourth dimension. Time, however, is not always
analogous to space. D.H. Mellor discussed these disanalogies at length. He,
for instance, concluded that there is no spatial analogue for our feeling of
the passing of time. We cannot, in other words, attribute the passing of time
to spatial changes (Mellor, D. H. _Real Time II_. London: Routledge, 1998.
95-96. Print.).

To pursue a brief tangent, not all theories of time think of time as a line.
Eternalists see time in one dimension, but their view of time is more in
keeping with a circle. Emery, et al. state:

To exhaust a well-known example, time moves faster at higher altitudes, the
further one is from the Earth’s center. This might be suggestive of time
behaving differently along the vertical axis. This also readily explains the
relative experiences of someone falling into a black hole and another person
seeing this happen. Recall the following:

Another eternalist conception that has been entertained can be called
recurrentism. Nietzsche probably explains it best:

In the sixth dimension, one would be able to see the universe as it was at the
beginning and an array of possibilities. One would, for instance, see
universes in where the rate of entropy is lower or higher than in ours. If
Boltzmann was correct, and time emerges from basic probabilities, then we
would see universes in where .000000001 nanoseconds do not equal a second, but
instead, .0.000000001515 nanoseconds equal a second, implying that time moves
slightly slower in that universe than it does here. This is to say nothing
about the arrow of time, which could move in the opposite direction (see
Cartwright, John. [“We may have a spotted a parallel universe going backwards
in time”](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24532770-400-we-may-have-
spotted-a-parallel-universe-going-backwards-in-time/). _New Scientist_. 8 Apr
2020. Web. and De Chant, Tim. [“Big Bang May Have Created a Mirror Universe
Where Time Runs Backwards”](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/big-bang-
may-created-mirror-universe-time-runs-backwards/). _Nova_. 8 Dec 2014. Web.).

Consider, as an example, the b-moments in Friedrich Nietzsche’s life.
Friedrich Nietzsche’s birth on October 15, 1844 is one b-moment and his death
on August 25, 1900 is another. The dates of both represent distinct b-times.
On TPT, he is spread out from October 15, 1844 to August 25, 1900. If we were
to depict him in a space-time diagram, his parts on our diagram will depict
his temporal parts. If we were capable of watching Nietzsche in his infancy,
we will be observing a temporal part, then another that resembles it, and then
another. If one were to watch infant Nietzsche long enough, his later temporal
parts will be slightly bigger than the previous ones. That is to say that
Nietzsche is no longer an infant; he is now, for instance, a toddler. So on
our space-time diagram, Nietzsche grows the further we move away from his
birth. It is also worth noting that temporal parts have spatial parts and vice
versa. Nietzsche’s hand, like Nietzsche himself, persisted within the interval
of time his life occupies. The parts he was comprised of will also be
represented on our space-time diagram.

2\. The speed at which they appear to fall in will get asymptotically slow;
they will appear to fall in towards the event horizon at a slower and slower
speed, never quite reaching it.

We tend to give the present an ontological status greater than that of the
past and the future. It appears that the only escape we have is the idea of
spatio-temporal oblivion. Queen Elizabeth I is not somewhere in the past under
the mistaken impression that _she_ and _not us_ is present. Time, therefore,
probably does not have one dimension. Forward implies backward and up implies
down, so any linear or circular view of time runs into problems of recurrence
and all sorts of time-related paradoxes like the well-known Grandfather
Paradox. Without straying too far in quantum mechanics, all of this is already
implied in Bell’s Theorem: “Most models of nature are reversible in time; we
can run the basic equations backwards in time as easily as forwards in time.
This implies that theories with causality forwards in time must also have
causality backwards in time; this was ignored by Bell” (t’Hooft, Gerard.

On the cosmological interpretation of eternal return (see
[here](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2016/05/15/interpretations-
of-nietzsches-doctrine-of-eternal-return/)), eternalism simply is the idea
that time is like a circle. There is a sense in which recurrentism is already
implied and though eternalists are usually not committed to the idea of time
literally repeating itself, if Socrates and Martian outposts exist, then time
and causation are a loop. This implies that some future event will jumpstart
the Big Bang and every event in the universe will play out in identical ways
all over again. This is precisely the sort of thinking entailed in the
presentist’s response to eternalism. Heather Dyke explains:

I would highly recommend getting a handle of Pössel’s illustrations if you
would like to better understand how time and space trade places within a black
hole. For our purposes, the fact that this happens in a black hole might offer
a clue. Perhaps the lesson to be learned from the inner workings of blacks
holes is that time has more than one dimension. Maybe the relativity of time
inhered in General and Special Relativity has to do with the fact that time is
superimposed or even supervenes on space in a different way relative to one’s
direction in space. In other words, time has a horizontal behavior, so to
speak. It has a slightly different vertical behavior. Further still, it has
another behavior along curved or edged spaces within the dimension of depth.
On Earth, we commonly move as though we lived in two-dimensions, so thinking
of moving in a third dimension is difficult to conceptualize. We would have to
travel in space to get a better idea of how the effects of gravity, over long
distances, look like traveling along a curved surface. Or, we can simply think
of the difference between Mario on Super Nintendo versus Mario on the Nintendo
Switch. When Mario performs any movements in the depth dimension, or to add to
our x- and y-axes, a z-axis, he is now covering diagonal domains analogous to
the width of a cube, for instance.

The fact of the matter is that we simply do not fully comprehend our own
universe and so, we can be gravely mistaken about time. If one considers ST,
and not necessarily whether the theory is true, but rather what the theory can
teach us, one quickly notices that ST’s dimensions have consequences for time
that are arguably more important than their ramifications for space. If ST is
the case or if something close to it is true, time is ultimately nonlinear and
therefore, not one-dimensional. So let us walk through what two-dimensional
time might look like. First, imagine that the ancestors of homo sapiens in the
far off future have invented time machines. If they can travel to and fro in
time, time is still one-dimensional. In two dimensions of space, one can move
horizontally and vertically. So then the question arises, what would it mean
for time to move vertically?

What if the critical error we continue to make is thinking of time as one-
dimensional? What if time has more than one dimension, just like space does? A
cursory look at Superstring Theory (ST) will begin to sound exactly like me in
a footrace with parallel me. Parallel or possible worlds emerge from the fifth
and sixth dimensions of ST. If it were possible to see the fifth dimension, we
would be able to take note of similarities and differences between the world
we occupy and a parallel world. Perhaps this is what our imagination does. If
a runner gets a cramp in her calf a few meters from the finish line, she may
envision herself winning the race in a world in where she did not get injured.
Perhaps we do, in fact, see the fifth dimension, but I digress.

Lately, I have been thinking a lot about time, both on a personal level and on
a philosophical one. Setting aside all of my thoughts on the kind of freedoms
and privileges I would need to truly own my time, the phenomenon of time
occupies my thoughts, in many ways from the mundane to the complex. When I was
younger and far less patient, I would grow incensed having convinced myself
that I picked the wrong bus out of the two that showed up at roughly the same
time because the other bus eventually drove past mine. As I got older and my
philosophical tendencies started to take root ever deeper, I started to notice
how whenever the other bus drove by the bus I was on, it would never get too
far ahead. In fact, it would arrive at my stop less than a minute before mine
did.

Nietzsche, therefore, has spatio and temporal parts, so if presentism were
correct, the interval of time represented by the ~54 years Nietzsche lived
would enter oblivion. The flow of time, as it pertains to Nietzsche’s life,
ends and yet, continues. Perhaps a better analogy (though in actuality, this
is time moving in three dimensions), presentists seem to imagine that time is
like a river, at least on the surface, but within it are whirlpools in where
intervals of time meet their end. With difficulty, therefore, one can imagine
time in more than one dimension even if one is not convinced of presentism.
Consider instead the growing blocking theory (GBT). On GBT, the present and
the past are real and the future becomes real when the present edge meets it.
Similarly, on the moving spotlight theory (MST), only objects within the
spotlight are considered present though objects on the peripheries still exist
(Emery, Ibid.). How might two-dimensional time look like under GBT or MST?

So came my idea of _virtual simultaneity_. From there, I would imagine a
parallel me, a sort of ghost, who in another universe got on the other bus and
I would imagine how far ahead of me he would be on his walk toward my
building. I would then speed up so that I would catch up to my parallel on my
way home as means to feel better about not having been on the bus that arrived
earlier. This is how I think about time, in a very intimate sense. Nothing
stops me in my tracks like an article about time. My mind could be furtherest
from time and from philosophy more generally, reading fan theories about a
show I am into or looking up the latest sports scores, and when scrolling, an
article about time shows up and I am immediately in that headspace. This was
the case two days ago when I read Musser’s article “A Defense of the Reality
of Time.”

1\. The light coming from the person gets redshifted; they’ll start to take on
a redder hue and then, eventually, will require infrared, microwave, and then
radio “vision” to see.

Especially for people high on the idea of the universe being conscious or that
there is a god(s), the universe would therefore offer us clues to help us
better understand time. Think of the notion of space and time changing places
within a black hole. Going back to the paradigm, namely the four-dimensional
concept of space-time, time would then have three dimensions and space would
have one. As Pösel explains:

Time is one of the most difficult phenomena to apprehend in the universe. It
is as elusive as it is seductive. It is safe to say that no one has won over
this lover’s heart. No one has seduced her enough to understand all of her
mysteries and secrets. It is because of this that I am often discouraged to
write anything about time, despite growing confidence in my philosophical
capacities. But just then, Musser said something that got the gears of my mind
running.

In the seventh dimension, one may find themselves in the mirror universe on
the other side of the Big Bang, in where the arrow of time travels backwards.
The eighth dimension would give one access to exotic universes, with initial
conditions so far from our own. In the ninth, one would possess the power to
compare and contrast every possible world from worlds very much like our own
to worlds decidedly unlike ours. Finally, the tenth dimension exhausts every
possibility.

For simplicity’s sake, I will consider GBT. Since presentists deny the spatio-
temporal parts of the past and thus, bury the past, we can imagine that for
presentists, time moves to the right on the x-axis (that is, along the first
quadrant of the axis) and also downward on the y-axis (along the fourth
quadrant). Growing block theorists, on the other hand, since they believe in
the future emerging at the present edge, see time moving in the same direction
as presentists on the x-axis, but moving along the y-axis in the opposite
direction, upward in the first quadrant. In other words, if the death of
temporal parts is a downward movement, the birth of temporal parts is an
upward movement.

3\. The _amount_ of light coming from them gets less and less. In addition to
getting redder, they also will appear dimmer, even if they emit their own
source of light!

If the observer never quite sees the faller fall into the back hole while the
faller notices no difference in the passage of time and ultimately, crosses
the event horizon, time here can be taking on a different behavior along the
z-axis, in the dimension of depth along a curved plain. The 3:1 relation of
space-time can be simplified with a 3:3 relation which is virtually the same
as 1:1 or colloquially, one-to-one. To my mind, if simplicity is the aim, then
this is our next recourse. ST was borne out of an attempt to condense the
three dimensions of space into one dimension. That unfortunately did not work,
at least not as intended. We should therefore attempt to think of time in
three dimensions and see how this might help the project of unifying physics.

Ultimately, our theories of time, along with physics, may be impeded by the
idea of one-dimensional time. Maybe it is time for us to begin thinking about
the behavior of time in two or three dimensions. ST already shows that there
are peculiarities about time across multiple dimensions, implying further that
the ten dimensions of ST are not dominated by space. In other words, it is not
that nine out of the ten dimensions belong to space and still one to time.
There could be a disproportion, like a space-time ratio of 6:4, but if ST
entails a few dimensions of time, we should begin conceptualizing how time
behaves in a multi-dimensional setting. This might help us to finally unravel
all of her mysteries and secrets. Until then, I leave you with a mind-bending
interpretation of what happens inside of black hole from Christopher Nolan’s
“Interstellar.”

Ultimately, we begin to see why it is of the utmost importance to break up the
Christian monopoly in philosophy of religion, so to speak. We can see how the
winding history of ātman and anattā anticipate certain strains in the
philosophy of mind while also providing new, fertile ground in the philosophy
of religion. In Advaita Vedānta, there is just one self, the Brahman. Every
other idea of self is illusory. This has some staggering implications for
ongoing discussions about identity as well. In Buddhism, given anattā, we see
that the “I Am that I Am” uttered by Yahweh is ultimately an error of the ego,
overinflated and now extended into the idea of God. Furthermore, this supports
the idea that the jealous, vindictive, tribalist gods so often prone to
favoritism, unironically, of the people who happen to worship them, are
created in our image. Anattā suggests that gods like Yahweh, Allah, and those
pertaining to the various mono and henotheisms around the world are extensions
of the ego imposing false ideas of the self. Most philosophers of religion,
concerned not only with the nature of but also with the identity of God,
seldom wrestle with the idea that perhaps there is no universal ātman, e.g.,
there is no God. This has some resonating implications all its own. The
purpose here has been to move the philosophy of religion in yet another
fruitful direction; while I can begin to exhaust possibilities, it is
important for me not to create a self-induced echo chamber, especially given
that my interest is to encourage philosophers of religion to travel down these
newly paved roads. Anattā has far reaching implications for free will, ethics,
identity, existentialism, and other areas of philosophy as well. In any case,
it should be clear why Christianity’s iron grip on the philosophy of religion
needs to be loosened.

Further exploration of the self and ego delve too far into the philosophy of
mind, but brief comments are in order. The Churchlands and Dennett adhere to
anattā if ātman is defined as _phenomenal_ consciousness. Ramsey states:

When considering the Hindu idea of ātman and the Buddhist response of anattā,
we can start to see how we could have avoided all of Descartes’ mistakes in
the philosophy of mind had we been more studied on Eastern religions or other
religions aside from Christianity. Christianity, akin to Dvaita, creates a
dualism between God and man. There is never a sense, per Christian theology,
in where man and God are identical or one. There is no sense in which man’s
consciousness and God’s are identical either. Descartes took this a step
further, dualizing the physical body and the mental soul. Hindus adhering to
Dvaita Vedānta had already committed this error and the Buddhist idea of
anattā, aside from reducing consciousness to the physical domain, suggested
that there is no-self to speak of and more importantly, that there is no
phenomenal consciousness to capture. It is an illusion.

As Coseru also points out, there is a sense in which the Buddhist idea of
anattā anticipated Hume who thought that there was no self to apprehend within
our perceptions. Along with anattā, Buddhists present “a fluid account of
experience as an ever-changing stream of psycho-physical events. This dynamic
model of human existence comprises the five classes of phenomena the Buddha
referred to as the “aggregates of grasping” ( _upādāna-skandha_ ), on account
of our tendency to grasp after and identify with them” (Ibid.). This is
opposed to our idea of a fixed self or consciousness experiencing life in a
Cartesian theater.

The Vedic idea of ātman never fell out of fashion as is made apparent in
Uddālaka’s teachings. His idea of ātman is pretty much identical: it is the
life force within all living things, the very essence creating a bridge
between the parts and the whole. This is in keeping with Advaita Vedānta in
where the “experiencing self (jīva) and the transcendental self of the
Universe (ātman) are in reality identical (both are Brahman), though the
individual self seems different as space within a container seems different
from space as such” (Menon, Sangeetha. [“Vedanta,
Advaita”](https://iep.utm.edu/adv-veda/). _Internet Encyclopedia of
Philosophy_. Web.). Yājñavalkya offers a different interpretation, equating
the self with consciousness rather than a life force. He ” characterizes the
self as that which has mastery over the otherwise distinct psycho-physical
capacities. He goes on to explain that we know the existence of the self
through actions of the self, through what the self does, not through our
senses—that the self, as consciousness, cannot be an object of consciousness”
(Black, Ibid.). Despite differences from Uddālaka’s interpretation,
Yājñavalkya still adheres to Advaita Vedānta. The Advaita school of Vedānta
yields a concept of God that accords with panentheism.

Prajāpati also equates ātman with consciousness, but crucially, he also
conflates it with the material body. Prajāpati, therefore, presents a strain
of another school in Vedānta, namely Dvaita, which is dualistic. In a sense,
it is a dualism of mind and body or consciousness and the material, but more
importantly, it is a dualism of jīva and the Brahman, e.g., humankind and God.
Given Prajāpati’s distinction, we see the beginnings of monotheism or
henotheism, and the much later _bhakti_ tradition in Hinduism in where a
devotee of a given god is to unite their soul to this god by way of their love
and devotion. Though there are other interpretations of ātman and Brahman in
Hinduism, Advaita and Dvaita suffice for our purposes.

On the philosophy of religion front, the concepts of ātman and anattā are
fertile ground for discussions within the cosmotheological and ontotheological
traditions (see Wildman, Wesley J. _Religious Philosophy as Multidisciplinary
Comparative Inquiry: Envisioning a Future For The Philosophy of Religion_.
State University of New York Press. Albany, NY. 2010. 248-261. Print. for an
overview of these traditions in the philosophy of religion). As stated
earlier, we now move away from mono or henotheistic frameworks and consider,
for example whether panentheism best explains features of the universe, on the
one hand, and features of being on the other. For one, consider the idea that
we are star stuff. We are comprised of the same matter and energy that
pervades the rest of the universe. In that sense, then, we are not distinct
and all things in the universe recede back to the Big Bang singularity.
Perhaps our ideas of essentialist distinction are illusory, a dream-like story
we continue to tell ourselves. In light of this, there is either no self or
the self reduces to the universe. Given the recent resurgence of panpsychism,
some have argued that the universe is very much like a supermassive brain (see
Ratner, Paul. [“The universe works like a huge human brain, discover
scientists”](https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/the-universe-works-like-
a-huge-human-brain-discover-scientists). _Big Think_. 19 Nov 2020). In any
case, a closer look at Hinduism and Buddhism will take us in non-monotheistic
directions that may prove fruitful in ongoing discussions in the philosophy of
religion and of mind.

In Buddhism, there is no ātman. We are, therefore, introduced to the concept
of anattā or non-self. There is no static, immutable, essential soul or
consciousness. This is crucial for Buddhist teachings regarding suffering (
_dukkha_ ) and detachment because if one does not have the idea of an
essential self, one is less likely to pity himself over others, to regard his
own suffering as having higher priority than that of other beings. Coseru
elaborates:

Interestingly, the non-duality of Advaita Vedanta (monism), can be seen as
paraphrasing anattā in that ideas of the self are illusory, a part of the
Brahman dream ( _maya_ ). This leads to the idea of _mokṣa_ , the notion that
we can free ourselves from the cycle of death and rebirth. For Hindus adhering
to Advaita Vedānta, _mokṣa_ is attained when one accepts the self as being one
with Brahman. For Buddhists, Nirvana is the emptying of ideas of self and
ultimately realizing that there is no self; this is how one comes to free
oneself from the cycle of death and rebirth. Under both interpretations, there
is a sense in which there is no self. On the one hand, any self that is at
variance with the Brahman is illusory, a product of the maya while on the
other, there is simply no self and any erroneous ideas we get about the self
proceed from the ego. The ego is the engine through which false narratives of
the self are created.

It can be argued, therefore, that if the history of philosophy of religion had
been different, then the history of philosophy of mind would have proceeded
differently. In other words, the missteps philosophers have taken throughout
the history of philosophy of mind likely would not have happened. Of course,
we would be dealing with a set of different mistakes, but some of these
mistakes would not prevail till this day due to the obstinacy of apologists
who do not want to relinquish the idea of Cartesian dualism. A thorough
understanding of ātman and anattā would have at least disabused us of the idea
of a theater of consciousness or a fixed self, and related ideas like qualia,
which as Dennett points out, are problematic. See my recent [“Nonphysicalism
in The Philosophy of Mind and Its
Shortcomings”](https://naturalistphilosophy.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/nonphysicalism-
in-the-philosophy-of-mind-and-its-shortcomings/) for a discussion on why the
ideas of qualia and phenomenal consciousness are untenable.
